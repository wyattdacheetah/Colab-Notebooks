### JUNE

_Flick, flick, flick._

The sound of the match striking against the box.

_Flick, flick, fwoomp._

The sound of the match engulfing into a tiny flame.

I moved the match towards the candle that stood upright, impaling the center of the cupcake, passing the torch. The candle was lit. Everything was ready.

I sat there, hunched over the birthday cupcake, alone in my bedroom at 1 in the morning. I stared down at the flame, feeling its warmth as it lit up my surroundings, being the only light source in my whole bedroom.

I looked over at the picture frame that sat on the desk inches away from the cupcake. It was of my mother. It was a really old photo.

I took a deep breath.  
  
  

"Hi, mom," I whispered, looking into the flame.

"I'm sorry to be bothering you like this,

"I know I can be really annoying at times, but...

"It's my birthday.

"And, yeah, I know I never make wishes, or, believe in making wishes, but at this time, I need every sliver of hope, whether it's unrealistic or not."

I looked down at the envelope I was holding in my hands.

"I really want to go here. I really want to go to this school.

"Please, please, mom. Please, let them accept me. I really need to get out of here.

"This is the only thing I'll ever ask of you, I promise."

I closed my eyes, sighing deeply.  
  
  
  

"I love you, mommy."  
  
  

A tear fell from my eye.

Without looking, I blew the candle out with a single breath, submerging myself into the dark emptiness of my own bedroom.

### AUGUST

Tears streamed down my face as the open road ahead of me seemed to move underneath the wheels of my car. I left in such a hurry that I forgot where I was headed for a second. My paws clenched the steering wheel as I watched the sun rise over the landscape of neverending trees and greenery, and a barren road that led to my impending destination.

_Am I really doing this?_

_Did I really run away from home?_

_Shut up, Charlie, you've been planning this for months. You can't turn back now. You left Dad a note. I'm sure he'll understand._

_But he won't._

_You know he won't._

_That's why you ran away in the first place._

_What have you got to lose anyway? You're headed to one of the best colleges in the state of Cloverland. They read your admission essay. They accepted you. Why are you crying?_

Dylan and Jonathan will be there waiting for me. My "best" friends from high school. Back in June, Dylan suggested I hitch a ride with them, but I have my own car. It was graduation day when he asked me. None of my family members attended. _Sorry, let me rephrase that, my only family member didn't attend._

I'm in the same dorm as Dill and Jonathan. Well, not really, I share a dorm with an animal I've never met before. They live in the same building, is what I meant.

They were thrilled to find out they got into CIVA. It's the best college in the state. Didn't I say that already? I didn't know where I wanted to go, but before I knew it, Senior year came and we had to pick someplace. So, they encouraged me to join them in applying for the Cloverland Institute of Visual Arts. I was hesitant at first, but I had no other options. Either CIVA or home.

Actually, Dad didn't expect me to leave.

He wanted me to stay home and help him with his career. He's an architect. He's a very rich and famed public figure. On the outside, that is.

I'm actually really excited. My obsession with this college grew each month that passed during the summer. I even made a wish on my birthday. I never make wishes. I never get presents, anyway. I don't even get parties.

When I got accepted, I was overjoyed.  
  
  

_Okay, I should probably stop bullshitting myself right now._  
  
  

I don't exactly have an obsession with this college and I'm not that excited.

To be honest, I just really needed to get out of that town.

I really needed to get away from my dad.  
  
  

My name is Charlie Cooperton. I'm a six-foot, white, Siberian Husky. Well, really I'm a crossbreed between a Siberian Husky and an American Eskimo dog. I know, the name sounds insane, but it was my mother's breed. Since it's a weird name and she's not really in the picture anymore, I just call myself a Siberian Husky; but my fur is fluffy and white as snow. That's the only trait I picked up from my mom. I'm not too skinny, but very tall; six-foot, like I said.

That's the main reason why I'm such a girl magnet.

I really hate that I just said that.

Don't worry, I'm not the clich√© bad-mouthed jock type-of-animal. Not really. I'm just tall.

A few hours later, I finally arrived. I pulled into a small but lively urban neighborhood. Every house was basically a brownstone and there was a whole new community park every few miles. I drove into campus.

Big, red letters on the side of a massive building read 'CLOVERLAND INSTITUTE OF VISUAL ARTS'. _Sheesh, they sure do know how to advertise._

I pulled into a parking space close to campus central and took a look around before unpacking my car.

The moment I stepped out of the Mini Cooper, the warm and freeing air of summertime hit me, brushing through the many bristles of my fur. It was very populated, animals were everywhere, living their lives. I saw a group of friends playing with a frisbee, others coming in and out of buildings, some adults dressed in business suits with clipboards speaking to other adults who were having problems... I don't know what to say other than just picture a normal college campus and this is it.

I opened the trunk of my car and pulled out my suitcase and backpack. I only had one of each. I don't have a lot of possessions other than my clothes. I grabbed my camera bag and slung it around my shoulder. My main hobby is taking photos. Film and Photography is my major this semester. It's a visual arts institution, so there are all sorts of creative classes here. I hope I can direct a film one day.

I walked down a concrete pathway surrounded by likely fake grass to meet up with my friends.

And there they were, Dylan Harrison and Jonathan Greenwood, sitting on a bench, searching for my presence.

Dill is a bit of an asshole. He's a tall hyena with somewhat of a set of muscles. He's actually really annoying, but not in a little-brother kind of way, no, more like a cliche bad-mouthed jock type-of-animal. Of course, he's wearing his Letterman football jersey from high school.

"There he is!" Dylan called, grabbing my hand and pulling me into a bro hug.

"Finally, he arrives!" Jonathan mocked.

Jonathan is definitely calmer than Dylan. He's a well-mannered lion with a tough exterior, but a sympathetic interior. We're all about the same height. That's probably why we're all friends. I don't know why I keep making jokes about height.

Jonathan has been my best friend since middle school. We have a deeper bond than most would expect but we don't like to admit it.

"I seriously don't understand why you didn't just cruise with us? We could've sung along to High School Musical, gotten high, cried, you know, the usual." Dill joked.

"I'd rather not live in a tortilla-chip-scented minivan for a whole day," I replied.

"Fuck you, dude." Dill chuckled, punching my shoulder.

"I guess we shouldn't keep you waiting any longer. Wanna check out the apartment?" Jonathan suggested.

"Yes, please. Let's go." I said, enthusiastically.

Jonathan and Dill turned and lead the way.

As we walked through campus, I got a better view of the life inside of CIVA. I saw some couples, some animals playing games, some eating lunch, some carrying books and papers, and some tugging luggage to move in, just like me.  
  
  

And that was when I saw him.  
  
  

The blue cat with pink stripes.

He was sitting, his back leaning against a tree, headphones over his ears, drawing on a tablet.

I don't know what intrigued me so much about him; he was like, twelve feet away from us; but, oddly, I wanted to take a photo of him. Animals like him, living their normal lives, interest me so much. That's why they're mainly the focus of most of my work. I always say that normal people are the most colorful subjects for photographs. You can ask the most questions. What could he be drawing? Listening to? Thinking about?

He was picture perfect.

_I wonder who he is?_

# 2. ROOMATES

\~~~

# Charlie

"And here we are!" Dill shouted with excitement, stretching both his hands out, focusing on the house before me.

It looked pretty large, yet pleasant and charming from the outside.

"It looks like a normal, suburban home?" I wondered aloud. "Are you sure this isn't a frat house?"

"Oh, no. You see, CIVA offers 'luxury' apartments." Jonathan spoke with air quotes emphasizing the 'luxury' part of the sentence.

"So, technically, it's not a dorm. It's a house." Dill explained.

"But, I still have a roommate?" I asked.

"Yeah, it's the only way we could afford it. We have three other people living with us." Jonathan responded.

"I thought you said only two?" I whined.

"Sorry, it was a better offer." Dill winced.

"So, there's gonna be six people living on this residence?" I spoke in disbelief.

"Don't worry, it's surprisingly larger on the inside than on the outside," Jonathan reassured. "We promise that we won't steal your food or your possessions, alright? This is a safe environment."

"There are three separate bathrooms!" Dill added.

"Three? Does that mean I have to share mine with my roommate?" I questioned. "Who even is he, anyway?"

"Some twink named Skyler." Dill mocked. "He already moved in, so you don't have to worry."

"He should be the one worrying, I moved in on the last day of summer. Classes begin tomorrow." I mumbled. "Is he home?"

"No clue, so, are we gonna stand around like retards or enter the damn house?" Dill slurred.

"Okay, Jesus, Dill!" Jonathan spoke, patting my back and leading me up the stairwell to the front door.

They were right, it really is much larger on the inside. Spacious, too. The living room was the first room you entered when stepping into the house. Everything; the floor, the walls, the stairs, all shared one theme: polished bright birch wood. It was nice and minimalistic. The living room had a couch, a recliner, a large, flat-screen TV with a game console, probably a Nintendo Switch, plugged into it. The kitchen was massive, too. It had many cabinets, a stove, an oven, a refrigerator, a countertop, all clean and shiny.

"You guys know how to clean? Shocking!" I laughed.

"Ha, ha. Very funny, Charlie." Dill replied.

I climbed up the nearby stairwell into a long, carpeted hallway with doors on each side leading to who-knows-where. Jonathan followed me to give me a tour.

"_Your_ bathroom, me and Dill's room, Byron and Milo's room, you and Skyler's at the end." He said, pointing out each and every room.

"I'm guessing Byron and Milo are our other roommates?"

"Yup, don't annoy them, though, Byron kinda scares me."  

"Looking forward to meeting him."

I walked down to the room at the end of the hallway. I grabbed the handle and opened the door. A slight breeze blew past me as it opened. I stepped inside. It was oddly sweet and relaxing. The whole room was colored white, a soft carpet covered the floor, two beds and two desks opposed each other on either side of the room like a mirror. The right side was already occupied. Whoever 'Skyler' was... man, he was very artistic. Paintings and drawings adorned his side's wall, mostly watercolor and pencil sketches. On his desk sat sketchbooks and colored pencils. Above his bed hung small LED string lights that varied in colors.

I thought I walked into a girl's bedroom for a second, holy shit. I mean, this is what you see in the background when you watch a fourteen-year-old girl's TikTok. I'm sorry I said that but it's true. Could it be possible that he was actually a she? I mean, the name is pretty girly if you ask me...

But, damn, he was incredibly talented. I placed my luggage and camera bag on my bed and took out my polaroid camera. I walked over to his desk and opened his sketchbook. It was littered with color; every page was different in its own artistic style. One page held mock-ups of realistic items, others housed characters and people, some he just cut out photos and formed them into a collage. I closed the sketchbook and looked at the wall of art. Each and every sheet of paper was unique in its own way.

I held up my polaroid camera and took a picture of the wall.

"Hello?" A small voice came from behind me.

I jumped, turning around, startled.

It was the blue cat with pink stripes. The one from before.

He's Skyler. He's my roommate.  

_Fuck._

"Hi! Hi, h-hi, I'm sorry!" I stuttered, fidgeting with the camera.

He stood there, awkwardly, with no expression on his face.

I had to say something, but nothing came out. _Why is speaking suddenly so hard for me right now?_ I attempted anyway.

"Um, I‚ÄìI just‚ÄìI just do this thing where I, uh, take photos that, um, represent... that capture... the overall theme‚Äìor the essence of normal people's lives..." I panicked. "I just thought your wall was so mesmerizing that I had to snap a quick picture... uh..."

He looked at me, confused. I felt like I should've been intimidated by him, but strangely I wasn't. He looked oddly small. Sorry, he _was_ oddly small. He was like a few inches shorter than me. It felt weird to be stared down by him though, if that's what he was doing. It just looked like he was confused.

This is embarrassing.

"You're really... talented?" I blurted out. It shouldn't have been a question.

"Thanks?" He spoke, finally. Also should not have been a question. He was as awkward as me. Almost like he regretted saying 'hello' or something. His arms were wrapped around his tablet, holding it to himself. He swayed a bit on his feet and looked to the floor.

I got a good look at him. He was wearing a black and white plaid button-up with dark, faded jeans. A leather messenger bag slung over his shoulder, and around his neck, he wore a chain with a bronze skeleton key accessory dangling from it. He wears a lot of dark colors considering how bright his fur is.

"Charlie," I said, holding out my paw to shake, braver this time. "Charlie Cooperton."

His paw came to mine slowly. He was still kind of uncomfortable, I could tell. He seemed very shy. When his paw touched mine, I shook it carefully.

His fur was soft and delicate.

"I'm guessing you're Skyler?" I broke the silence.

"Uh‚ÄìSky, I prefer Sky. Not Skyler." He stuttered, looking back down to the ground again.

"Hm. Nice to meet you Sky," I greeted. "So, I guess we're roommates!" I said, trying to brighten things up a little.

"Yeah," He mumbled, with a small smile. It looks like he was trying to be friendly too. "Nice to meet you." He sighed, passing me to sit back down. He grabbed his headphones that were wrapped around his neck and put them over his ears.

I guess that was his way of saying 'we're done talking now'.

I felt a little offended, but that wasn't gonna stop me from enjoying my stay here.

I hope.

"Look, I'm sorry that I took that photo, it was dumb of me not to ask permission," I muttered, placing the polaroid on the desk. He looked at it and picked it up as he slowly took his headphones back off. "I hope we can be friends in the future or something..." My voice trailed off into silence.

He took an extra-long look at the photo until opening his desk drawer and grabbing some scotch tape. He ripped a piece off and taped my polaroid to his wall of art.

He looked back at me. Face-to-face this time.

That's when I saw his bright, pink eyes.

_They... they were strangely pretty..._

"It's a good photo." He told me, before putting his headphones back on and going back to work on his tablet.

# 3. THE BLUE CAT WITH PINK STRIPES

\~~~

## Skyler

Skyler Hazel Clawfield.

That's my full name.

I don't know why my parents named me that but I guess they thought it was unique... or something.

Mom and Dad have always been very supportive of me, always wanting me to get out there, be myself, impact the world, etc. They've always loved me, and of course, I loved them back. They loved me so much that they had no doubt about how people would see me as I grew up. They thought a bright, pastel blue cat with pink stripes would definitely boost my popularity.

It sure did, alright.

I entered pre-school with a high metabolism and a positive outlook on life.

Elementary school passed, and the few animals that actually wanted to be my friend moved away or switched schools. I can't even remember their names anymore.

In middle school, I became a loner. No one wanted to talk to me, interact with me, anything whatsoever.

High school was a nightmare.

Apparently, if a living animal looks and acts opposite to their gender, you have every right to bully them. They checked off every box: dunked me in the toilet, beat me up for 'acting gay', stole my stuff and tossed it around as if they were playing hot potato, verbally insulted me and called me a faggot; All the classics. I don't blame them, I'm way too immature for my age. They had every right to knock some sense into me.

I'm not good enough.

As the years passed, the more depressive I became. My parents always wanted to know if I'd have been making friends and enjoying school; and as much as I wanted to say yes, I couldn't lie to them.

They've always been supportive, but that support was starting to feel like a lifeline.

What was once an energetic, sugar-fueled kitten is now a shy, worrisome cat.

All the harassment made me question my own sexuality. Yeah, sure, I owned many traits that resembled those of a female, (looked like a girl, spoke like a girl, dressed like a girl, etc.) but it felt normal to me. Hell, my parents could've told me I was born a she, and I would've believed it. I'm a blue and pink cat with a girly name. I know it can also be a boy's name, but still, it haunted me.

Am I gay? Bi? Trans? Who knows. I've never shown interest in someone before. Sure, I liked some boys, but I never imagined the scenarios to play out. The feelings were never real. I was better off in my own head. No one's shown interest in me either. If I gain real feelings for someone, then I'll know where to start. But for now, I'm just a confused ball of bundled-up emotional stress.

But that confusion didn't exactly help me win fights, you know?

Now, everywhere I go, I'm always anticipating some sort of persecution.

That's why my expectations are always so low.

That's why I'm always so blue, inside and out.

My parents made me go to a therapist, but I hated opening up to people. The only animals I can really trust are my family. I have no friends. No friends at all.

I get it, life sucks. But I have to get through it somehow.

That's when art comes in.

I've always had a love for drawing ever since I was a little kitten. I partook in that one activity ten times a day. Each day, I challenged myself to draw something different. It helped me get my mind off of the things that disturbed me. My mom used this hobby as a way for me to communicate. Cope. She called it 'art therapy'. She made me paint-out my troubles, any way I wanted to. Turns out my inner-anger is quite the artist. Henceforth, my mother and father scraped together just enough money to buy me a new drawing tablet for my thirteenth birthday. Words can not explain how thrilled I was when I tore open the wrapping paper. I mean, it was new technology, of course I was excited. My family was low on money, so they told me that this was the only special thing they could ever get me. Therefore, I loved it like a son. I used it every day, trying out the new digital pens and special effect filters for each new drawing I created. I still use it today. No bumps or scratches whatsoever. I adore that thing. As I learned more about art, the more I focused on it actually being a career I could pursue. I got a job just to buy myself new pencils and pens, sketchbooks, and paints. I was committed to my creativity. Art helped me see the joy in life.

So, of course, Mom pushed a little farther. She made me apply for the Cloverland Institute of Visual Arts when I graduated high school. I was hesitant at first, but then I saw all the courses, all the things I could learn to enhance my drawing skills.

I was ecstatic... until I found out that I had to live in an apartment with five other guys.

_Yeah, talk about gay panic._

I was scared out of my mind of what they would think of me. Every boy I've ever met throughout my entire life either disapproved of me or abused me. Living in a house, with a _roommate_ even, filled with other men might be my worst-est nightmare. Worse than high school.

I was terrified, but Mom and Dad were just so... happy... to see me happy... whenever I painted...

I didn't want to let them down. So, I went. They paid for my scholarship anyway, it was the least I could do. I loved them, and this was the only way for me to prove it.

Once I moved in, of course, the others gave me weird looks. Especially Byron the tiger. He seemed utterly disgusted, but, like, why? I didn't do anything.

I decided that I'd just ignore them. If anyone tries to hurt me, I'll just run away. If anyone tries to insult me, I'll look the other way. If anyone tries to talk to me, I'll just put on my headphones. I won't listen to them. I won't.

I don't care what they think about me. This is about my career, not my social life. I want to pursue art, so that's what I'm gonna do.  
  
  

That was until I met Charlie.

Our first encounter was weird, but so far, he's the only guy in the building who hasn't looked down on me in an inferior way. Believe it or not, he's actually as awkward as I am.

He was sweet. He shook my hand, complimented my work, took a photo of it...

He's nice.

He's pretty calm.

He's kinda handsome, too.  
  
  

Oh, shit.  
  
  

_Ohhhhhh, shit._

# 4. FRIENDS

\~~~

## Charlie

I unpacked my luggage. I fit my clothes into the closet. I put my notebooks, cameras, and other work-related stuff in the various drawers of my personal desk. I put my toiletries in the restroom and made my bed. I didn't bring anything to decorate, I hadn't thought about it. My side of the room looked very bland compared to Sky's. Beggars can't be choosers, I guess.

Sky just sat, drawing with his headphones on the entire time I was making myself at home.

After finishing tidying up, I went back downstairs. I heard the door open as Dill and Jonathan greeted a mysterious male voice.

"Hey, Charlie!" Dill called out to me. "Meet Byron!"

When reaching the living room I saw a tiger, who was weirdly intimidating and heavily threatening, enter through the front door. Jonathan was right. He looked down at me and flashed a wide, toothy grin. It looked like he was trying to be friendly, but unaware he was failing.

"What's up, man?" He smirked. We shook hands.

"The ceiling," I smirked.

"Ah, I hate you now, we can't be friends," He laughed.

"So, since Charlie has only been here for a few hours," Jonathan chimed in, patting me on the back. "We were thinking that we'd show him around the place, give him a tour, help him locate the buildings where his classes take place, and yadda, yadda, yadda."

"Oh, cool," I spoke, nonchalantly.

"Sounds boring, I'm in," Byron said, tossing his keys up into the air and then catching it.

"And off we go," Dill spoke, opening the front door and leading us to the staircase.

"Um, should we invite Sky to come with us?" I suggested.

Dill and Byron looked back at me as if I were joking.

"Pfft, that queer?" Byron scoffed. "He wouldn't be able to catch up." He walked down the steps towards the sidewalk.

"You have a nickname for him already? That's adorable." Dill joked, hopping down two steps at a time.

"He just wanted to be called that," I tried to reason, "and I don't wanna be rude, considering I respect other people's‚Äî"

"Damn, don't start sleeping with each other yet, you just met him, Charlie." Dill laughed.

Dill and Byron went ahead of me and Jonathan. Jonathan patted me on the back once again as I sighed.

"Told you," He said to me. "By the way, here's a map of the grounds."

Jonathan handed me a tiny laminated leaflet overviewing the campus. I opened it up and examined the landscape. CIVA is pretty massive, not gonna lie. It takes up at least 1/6 of the town it's located in.

Jonathan spent the rest of the walk to show me all the buildings I'd have to get to during the weekly/daily schedule. The four of us visited each and every building and classroom in the refreshing cool breeze juxtaposed to the sweltering hot days of summer. Standing in the empty lecture hall helped me get a sense of what I'd be enduring this semester. The boys even taught me some shortcuts that would get me to class faster if I was ever running late. I also got to meet some of the professors that would be lecturing me. Getting a hands-on experience with them would definitely boost my relationship with the institution. After that, Byron showed us a hidden alley to hit up if we ever needed weed_._ I didn't really care much for that, so Jonathan and I decided to leave earlier.

"Sorry, you had to see that," Jonathan chuckled on our way back.

"Don't sweat it," I told him. "So, have you met Milo yet?"

"Yeah, he's cool." Jonathan faltered. "He's very quirky, I'll say that."

"'Quirky', huh?"

"Yeah, he's like 'geeky', you know? Like, obsessed with anime or Star Wars or some shit like that."

"Thanks, I have a clear image." I laughed.

"How are you holding up so far? With the move?"

"I'm good," I spoke after taking a deep breath. "Dad's probably gonna kill me."

"Don't say that, man."

"No, I'm serious. If he can beat me up for... You know what, nevermind. Forget I said anything."

"How's your roommate?" Jonathan asked after an awkward silence.

"He's cool," I answered. "Super talented, though. Like, unbelievably good at art."

"Cool beans," Jonathan sighed somnolently.

As I said before, I met Jonathan in the seventh grade and have been best friends with him ever since. He went through a few phases; we actually stopped being friends at one point, but we reconciled and went on with our dumbass fucking lives. The sun was setting and it was almost time for our lights-out curfew.

Jonathan and I returned home. I grabbed a snack for 'dinner' and ran upstairs to the bathroom. I brushed my teeth, fixed my fur, and entered my room.

Sky was there, sitting upright in his bed, doodling on his tablet. I think it was, like, a Surface Pro or something. His eyes darted to me, a little shocked. He took his headphones off from his pointy ears and folded the flap over the tablet, shutting it off.

"Hey, man," I said to him, putting the leaflet Jonathan gave me in the desk drawer.

"Hi," Sky responded wearily.

_His voice is so soft and fragile... I wonder if he's okay?_

"You excited?" I said, sitting atop my bed. "To start college tomorrow?"

Sky looked at me and shifted awkwardly in his bed.

"I guess," He muttered.

Something seemed wrong. I couldn't help but wonder if there was something troubling him. _Was it because of me taking the photo or something deeper?_

"You okay?" I asked him.

"I'm good..." He slurred, yawning.

He looked kind of cute when he yawned, his small form, stretching his limbs as wide as they can go.

"You don't seem good."

"Why do you care?" He spoke, looking at me with concerned eyes.

"Am I not supposed to?" I replied, leaning forward. "Are you an off-limits person, do I get arrested if I try to communicate with you?" I joked. Sky exhaled through his nose, the sides of his mouth curling up a little.

"It's not that simple." He murmured, his somewhat-of-a-smile fading away.

"What do you mean by that?" I intrigued.

"Well, considering you're the first person as to not call me a faggot in the first ten minutes of knowing me, I'm guessing you're that kind of guy that just wants to be friends with every person he meets. Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but, again, it's not that simple. The world can either shake your hand or stab you in the back. People have sharp teeth and no limit to biting."

My smile went away.

Sky looked at me.

"Crap," he whined. "I-I'm sorry, I-I don't know where that came from. I'm really sorry."

"H-hey, no. Don't be. You're right." I reassured, chuckling. "It's late and you're tired. You should get some sleep, alright?"

I smiled at him. He looked to the floor before nuzzling under the covers.

"Do you want me to get the light?" I suggested. He nodded softly, and I stood up to turn it off.

After the room went dark, I pulled off my shirt and jeans and hopped into bed. It was a warm night. I sat there in bed awkwardly. I couldn't fall asleep. I looked to Sky across from me once my eyes settled in the darkness.

He was wearing his headphones.

I sighed softly and directed my eyes away.

"Do people call you a... a fag?" I asked to the ceiling, not thinking Sky could hear me.

"Everyone does," Sky responded. I darted my eyes back to him, caught off guard.

"I thought you couldn't hear me?" I claimed. "B-because of..."

"It's just white noise. I'm not listening to Taylor Swift or some idiotic repetitive pop song."

"White noise..?"

"It's basically soft static. Like rain. I can't stand silence. It's too loud. I get really uncomfortable when things start to seem okay."

"Oh."

We laid there, not saying a word to each other for about a minute. But Sky was right, the silence made it a long minute.

"Do you think I'm a faggot?" Sky whispered to me.

"Just because you're good at art and have a sense of style doesn't mean you're a faggot, Sky."

"No, do you? Do _you_ think I'm a faggot?"

I took a deep breath in.

"No. I don't. I think you're unique."

It became silent once again. Sky laid facing the ceiling, as did I. We weren't looking at each other but we both could definitely detect some tension happening between us.

I decided to make a suggestion.

"You don't have to answer now, but I think we should be friends," I stated. "Not because I think it's mandatory, not because I pity you, but because I like you, Sky. You're cool. We should be friends."

Again, silence.

I yawned and then turned on my side to face the wall. I closed my eyes, ready for my dreams to take over me.  
  
  

"Okay." Said the soft, fragile voice behind me.  
  
  

I smiled, drifting into a deep sleep.

# 5. CLASSES

# Skyler

A little bit of sunlight shined through the blinds and hit me in the face, waking me from slumber. I yawned and sat up in bed feebly, rubbing my eyes. I can't lie, the bed was super comfy. Another pro to add to my list of the pro and cons of CIVA. They're almost tied now.

I looked to the analog clock on my desk that was purposefully turned the other way to face me so I could read it every morning. 6:05 AM. It's pretty early, but I'm a morning bird so it's okay.

I turned my head right to see Charlie, collapsed in his bed.

I've already addressed that I have developed some sort of a crush on him, so my current mission is to avoid him as much as I can to let these feelings fizzle out. Seeing him lie there in his boxers wasn't exactly doing me any favors, though.

I mean, he's really cute when he's snoring‚Äì_Crap, I told him I'd be friends with him last night._

I should not have let my sleepy-self take control of my actions. I told myself I wouldn't let anyone sway my emotions, I'm not here to socialize, I'm here to learn.

I made my bed quickly, took a shower, brushed my teeth, put on deodorant, changed into my normally dark clothing, grabbed my stuff for school, ate breakfast.

Milo was the first to come down after me. He's a raccoon. He didn't even change or take a shower, as raccoons do.

"Wow, you're up early." He yawned, looking in the cupboard for cereal.

"Just... wanted to be prepared for the first day," I muttered.

"Alright, Leslie Knope." He said, pulling out a bowl and spoon from the cabinets.

I looked into my backpack, searching for my sketchpad. It wasn't in there.

In a quick movement, I dashed through the living room, up the stairway, and down the hall.

I was about to open the door to the bedroom, but something stopped me.

I could hear Charlie's muffled voice beyond the door. He was awake.

It sounded like he was on a call.

"Hey, I just wanted to check in, see how you were doing? It's been a minute since we talked, I know how much you like to brief me on your new college life... Just, call me back! I will await your response, haha. See ya, Cass."

I heard him hang up the phone.

_Cass?_

_Who is Cass?_

\~~~

"So, what brings you here, early in the morning, Sky?" Mr. Bateman asked me, sitting down in his big swivel chair.

I left the apartment before anybody else woke up and decided to make an unscheduled meeting with my art professor. I've met with him a couple of times, so we're familiar with each other. He's seen some of my art and said he can't wait to work with me this semester. He's a middle-aged wolf with a degree in mixed media. What can I say, I look up to him.

"Well, Mr. Bateman, sir," I spoke up, shifting in the chair across from his desk. "I was hoping we could discuss, um, my career as an artist. I want to do more. I want to push myself in order to show that I am capable of succeeding. I was hoping if there was any way I could do more than what I'm assigned?"

"Mr. Clawfield," Mr. Bateman tilted his head in dissatisfaction. "How can you ask for more work when you haven't even started what is given?"

"I just want you to know that I am prepared for any task that is asked of me‚Äî"

"Sky," Mr. Bateman interrupted. "I can't have you jumping into a battlefield without knowing what you're up against. It's unknown territory."

"But, sir, I thought readiness could boost my capability‚Äî"

"It could set you up to fail if you don't have the right idea," Mr. Bateman stated. He sighed apologetically. "I admire your determination, Sky, I really do. But not learning to pace yourself is one of the many mistakes people overlook when... You're a smart kid. I know you. Is there any particular reason why you're bringing this up all of a sudden? Hell, an hour before your first year of college begins?"

I looked to the floor, releasing a sigh of discontent.

"I just... I just... I..." I tried to speak, but nothing came out.

"Here," Mr. Bateman spoke, reaching under his desk. "If you're looking for extra credit, this could help you out a little. There's this annual painting and essay competition. State competition. Usually, winners are announced by the end of May and they are awarded in June, but I'll give you a major head start since you're so devoted. All you need to do is create something, anything that speaks to you, and write an essay about it and why you created it. This pamphlet will give you the details."

I grabbed it from his hand and looked through it, intrigued.

"It's due in May, so you'll definitely have time. If you win, that's major credits for next semester and valuable information to put in your portfolio," He laughed. "I'm counting on you. Impress me."

I looked up at him.

"I won't let you down."

\~~~

8 AM. Drawing class began.

My first class with Mr. Bateman went smoothly. Obviously, he's my favorite teacher. He's well-spoken, creative, and understanding. He knows his way behind a paintbrush. He's like Bob Ross. He introduced us to what we'd be studying this year and how to maneuver properly throughout the day.

I always sit in the back, I never want to draw attention to myself. That just puts a bigger target on my back.

10 AM, second class.

Walking into the lecture hall, I realized my professor for Mixed Media is the only one I haven't met yet. Mrs. Goodwin; she's an 80-year-old armadillo who basically can't even beat a turtle in a race because she never made it past the starting line. I mean, she's sweet and all, but a few decades too late.

And apparently, she's young enough to be teaching mixed media this year.

Again, I waltzed towards the back of the room, hoping that my plan will work a second time.

I was unpacking my notebooks and sketchpad until I noticed a red fox enter through the doorway. That would've been normal, as every other animal was entering the classroom too, except for the fact that when she examined the room, her eyes suddenly landed on me. I looked down immediately, trying not to make eye contact. I started to doodle on my sketching tablet for a second or two.

Then I looked up to see she was gone.  

"Can I sit here?"

Yet, she wasn't.

I looked to my left to see the fox, smiling, pointing to the seat next to me.

"Uh, yeah‚Äîsure, of course." I stuttered, not wanting to be rude.

"Great!" She beamed, slinging her Fjallraven Kanken backpack around the chair. Her personality was very ditzy, but her style was pretty unique. She was wearing a denim jacket that was littered with doodles and acrylic paint. She had added her own patterns and markings, giving it a pop of color; which I very much admired.

"Get a load of Internet Explorer," she scoffed, looking at our professor. She sat down next to me. "God, retire already!" She groaned.

I chuckled a bit. She looked at me.

"Claire," She greeted. "Claire Chloe Harper." She held out her paw for me to shake. I didn't know whether to or not, but it would be incredibly impolite not to.

"Just kidding, I'm a germaphobe." She jeered, retracting her hand immediately when I went to grab it.

I exhaled through my nose, again. I don't really laugh a lot, so this is my best option.

"I love that, by the way," She expressed, pointing to the drawing on the cover of my notebook. It was a doodle of a bird soaring, leaving behind a tail of various small items that pertained to myself. "Did you do it yourself?"

I nodded.

"You don't speak much."

I shrugged, not knowing what else to do. I get it, 'just talk'. The thing is, when I talk I start to worry, when I worry I begin to ramble, and when I ramble I find myself in the oddest situations.

Like last night.

"Good, I hate chatterboxes. Like our lovely lady over there," She spoke sarcastically, pointing to the teacher. I could tell she was lying just to make me comfortable, she's somewhat of a chatterbox herself.

"Sky," I told her. "The name's Sky." I looked to her and gave her a toothless smile.

"Aesthetic. So what's your story, Sky? How'd you end up here?"

"Emancipation." I jested. She gave me a funny look. "Nope, sorry. Kidding."

Claire chuckled.

"Well, my asshole of a mother decided it would be great to sign me up for art classes all because I drew one portrait of her. One. Now I have a bunch of classes I'm not even interested in, including this one. With Mrs. Hag. I mean, she's like, what, ninety-four? Can she even turn on a light switch?"

That was until our professor opened up her laptop, connected it swiftly to a projector, opened an art program, and wrote her name and room number in perfect cursive in front of all of us.

I winced.

"Looks like you spoke too soon," I whispered to her.

"That indeed," Claire responded.

"What did you want to do initially?" I asked.

"Well, my dream was to be a chef," She answered.

"Seriously?"

"Yeah, I know, long story, but I really wanted to go to culinary school!"

"Well, there's a lot of great things in art that I'm sure you'll discover."

"Yeah, I know, I wasn't born yesterday. I'm good at art and all, I just really wanted to cook. Ratatouille was and still is my favorite Disney movie."

"Mine is Wall-E."

Claire looked at me and smiled once again. I'll admit, she is very beautiful. But I don't have any feelings for her... I feel like that should concern me.

"I like you, we should be best friends." She whispered in my ear.

"We barely know each other. Best friends is a bit of a stretch, don't you think?"

"Well, the only one I have at the moment is from my high school, and every animal I've tried to collaborate with just thinks I'm a crazy lesbian. You're the first decent animal I actually appreciate since I stepped foot in this college."

_Oh my god._

_She's the girl version of me._

_I love her._

"Best friends it is." I smiled.

"Yessssss!" Claire celebrated, patting me on the back, hard. "Also, this is the first time you've smiled."

"First time since I got here."

"Double points, baby, let's go!" She said, raising her hand for a high five.

"Excuse me! Is there something you two would like to share with the class?" Mrs. Goodwin called out to us in the back.

Embarrassed, I hid my face.

"Oh, it's nothing, doc. Resume your lesson." Claire spoke up. Everyone was staring at us.

"I don't wanna hear another word!" She warned, henceforth, resuming her lesson.

# 6. THINGS ARE GOINNG TO GET BETTER

\~~~

## Skyler

12 PM.

There was a miniature food court open on-campus celebrating the first day of college, so Claire and I decided to eat lunch there together. She got a cheeseburger, fries, and a strawberry milkshake. I just got a salad and a bottle of water.

It sure was crowded, there were animals everywhere, taking up every space on the sidewalk. Claire and I laughed as we tried to push through the blur of various clothing colors to find a place to sit.

I can't believe it, I actually found a real friend! In high school, all of the girls thought I was either a creep or a school shooter. Claire actually respects me for my differences. Today has been a pretty okay day so far... I hope it lasts.

We located a picnic table and sat down. Claire immediately dug into her meal as I ripped the wrapping off of a plastic fork.

"Jeez, you're hungry," I chuckled, amazed by how wide her jaw can open.

"I may be a fox, but I'm wolfing this down, dude." She laughed through big bites.

"What are you, a cannibal?" I joked, stabbing my salad with my fork.

"Plant-based products, man," Claire swooned, taking another huge bite. "It's a fucking furnace out, and you're wearing all that black over that fur? How are you not incinerating right now?" I looked down at my black shirt, black jeans, and black-gray flannel.

"Oh, you know, I'm an e-boy at heart." I mocked, pushing my fur to cover my eyes. Claire snorted with a mouthful of food.

I laughed. _I can't believe I'm laughing. I can't believe how much fun I'm having._

Today is a good day. Is it just me, or is it really nice out right now? The sun beaming down on us, Claire's witty humor making me laugh, everything is going so well. What could go wrong?

Spoke too soon.

Behind Claire, I saw Charlie and my housemate Jonathan Greenwood in the distance, food in hand, looking for a place to sit. I ducked my head, hoping he wouldn't see me. But of course, it's pretty hard not to spot a bright blue cat with pink stripes. He made eye contact with me, smiled, and journeyed over. Jonathan followed behind.

"Hey, Sky!" He called once he got to our table. Claire turned around to see who was behind her.

"Hi, Charlie," I sighed, looking down at my food. Seeing him makes me panic, so I tried my best not to look at his face.

"Did you get up early? Didn't see you when I woke up." He asked.

"Yeah, sorry," I responded. "I had to do something."

"Oh, no worries," He promised.

It got awkwardly silent for a few seconds. Claire looked at me, confused.

"Oh, yes, sorry," I stuttered. "Claire, these are my roommates, Charlie and Jonathan."

"Oh, why hello, boys." She greeted, standing up to shake their hands. "I'm Claire Chloe Harper."

"Nice to meet you, Claire Chloe Harper," Jonathan spoke after Claire shook his hand.

"Same," Charlie said. "So, I don't suppose you two have any room for us, if you don't mind?"

"Oh, not at all!" Claire bubbled. Despite me saying she's the girl version of me, Claire and I are pretty different. She's more outgoing, I'm more of an introvert. She's very sweet and polite. _I wonder if I could be as nice as her?_

Of course, Charlie sat next to me, and Jonathan sat next to Claire.

"So, do you guys know each other or..?" Charlie questioned as he began to eat his food.

"Oh, not really, we just met today," Claire answered.

"Mixed Media class," I added.

"Do you two know each other?" Claire returned the question.

"Yes, we're best buds for life," Jonathan said, reaching over the table and giving Charlie's forehead a noogie. "From what Charlie says, I hear you are a very talented artist," Jonathan said to me, opening a bag of potato chips.

I looked at Charlie, who flashed a crooked smile at me.

"Y-Yeah, I guess..." I muttered. _They talked about me. Charlie talked about me._

Claire looked at me, sensing the tension. I turned my head away from Charlie and back down at my salad, drifting back into the repetitive silence that has been haunting us ever since we met.

"Are you a talented artist, too, Claire?" Jonathan asked.

"Artist, yes. Talented, you tell me." Claire said, reaching for her backpack. "Wanna see some of my stuff?"

"Totally," Jonathan replied.

Claire took out a notebook and gave it to Jonathan. He opened it up and examined every page.

"Wow," Jonathan gushed. "You really love to draw food."

"She originally wanted to be a chef," I noted.

"Yeah, but the bitch thought this was a better path, so, thanks, mom!" Claire giggled, sticking her middle finger up to the sky.

"Either way, you are incredibly talented." Jonathan complimented.

"Oh," Claire looked at Jonathan, pushing a few strands of hair out of her face. "Thank you!"

I could see that she was blushing. So was Jonathan. Charlie and I looked at each other, aware of what was going on.

"So, Sky," Charlie whispered to me as Claire and Jonathan chattered. "What class do you have next?"

"Oh, uh, let me check," I said, pulling out the folded-up schedule in my pocket. "Graphic Design, I believe."

"Oh, awesome, me too!" He chirped. "Graphic design is a huge aspect of photography. It's my major, photography."

"Yeah, I remember." I grinned, thinking back to our first encounter.

"Yes... that happened," Charlie cringed. I giggled, taking another bite of my salad.

"It's almost 1," Charlie stated, finishing his food and throwing it out in a trash can near the table. "Wanna walk to our next class together?"  

"Why not," I sighed. For some reason, I can't say no to people.

"Let me get that for you," Charlie helped, grabbing my empty salad tray and throwing it out too. I was flattered by the gesture. He got up, ready to leave.

"Hey, lovebirds," I said, interrupting Claire and Jonathan in the middle of their conversation. "Charlie and I are gonna go to our next class,"

"Okay, have fun, bestie!" Claire burst. I smiled at her and waved goodbye to them.

"Bye, Jonathan," Charlie called.

"See you," Jonathan returned, not even looking at us. Claire and Jonathan looked pretty occupied with each other.

"Jeez, when's the wedding?" Charlie joked to me under his breath as I joined him on the sidewalk.

"I think this is our fault," I simpered. We both burst with laughter. "Is it too late to say that I ship them?"

"Oh, god, don't go there." Charlie laughed. "Hey, so, I was wondering, because of our agreement last night," I started to worry for no reason. "Would you like to join me in taking a tour around town? Since we're both newcomers, you know?"

"I thought you did already with your... buddies."

"Oh, no. We only explored campus. I haven't seen the whole city yet."

"Uh..." I hesitated.

"C'mon, what do you say? You and me, night on the town?" Charlie whined, trying to make the idea sound fun.

He's so... sweet. I don't want to disappoint him. I can't say no to that face.

"Alright," I sighed.

"Nice!" He crowed.

We spent the next class with Mr. Scott, our Graphic Design teacher, bonding and joking around. Charlie showed me how to use and navigate an editing program that he used on his photos, which was also required for the class. He even showed me some of his work; he's very, as Jonathan says it, talented.

Jokes aside, he's a pretty great person.

Charlie's very... energetic. I hope my dreariness doesn't break his small, cheery heart. But, nonetheless, this hasn't been the worst encounter. I hope it's not too obvious how much I'm swooning over him.

But, regardless, no matter how much I question it, we're never going to happen. I still don't even know my sexuality.

He's a friend and I should be grateful, not wanting more. It's selfish of me.

He's a friend and I should be grateful.

Things are going better than intended.

I made a few friends, _real_ friends, that are actually interested in me and what I do. I was connecting with them, having actual conversations, having real laughter.

Maybe this year won't be so bad. It's off to a great start.

Things are going to get better.

They will.

# 7. THE OFFICIAL CHARLIE-SKY TOUR

\~~~

## Charlie

"Hey, you ready to go?" I called to Sky as I put on my shoes.

It was about 7 o'clock, and me and Sky were about to go out for a walk, as we had agreed to earlier today at lunch. Jonathan, Dill, and the others were attending some campus welcoming event that Sky and I had skipped out on.

"Almost there," Sky called from the bathroom. I sat by the stairwell, waiting for him.

"What's taking you so long?" I whined, knotting my shoelaces.

Sky emerged from the bathroom and joined me at the front door. He was wearing a dark blue beanie, a dark sweater with beige tie-dye stripes, dark ripped skinny jeans, and black ankle-high boots. It contrasted a lot to his pastel fur.

"What are you wearing?" I laughed, grabbing my keys from the counter.

"What?" He defended with a frown. "Charlie, you said you didn't see me as‚Äî"

"Wha‚Äîno, I-I don't," I interrupted. I took a deep breath and placed my paw on his shoulder. "What I meant was, what are you wearing? Isn't it, like eighty degrees out? Won't you die of the heat?"

"Oh," Sky looked to the floor. "I just... get cold easily."

I nodded, unlocking the door.

"After you, ice cube." I teased, holding the door open. He gave me a look and stepped out.

"Sorry for overreacting," Sky apologized as I closed the house door and locked it.

"Hey, don't worry about it," I said to him, ironically, worried by how much he worries.

"I just... I panic a lot," He admitted as we walked down the steps to the sidewalk. "I don't know why I'm telling you this... but I have a serious anxiety problem. Like, social anxiety."

"Ah, I see," I spoke under my breath.

"Yeah," Sky sighed, "It gets annoying how... easily I can break."

"I understand. I used to have anxiety problems too." I added, attempting to comfort him.

"Really?" Sky questioned. "You always seem so... cheery to me."

"Welp, I am Charlie Cooperton, son of a prize-winning, plastic, cookie-cutter, architect for a father. Cheery is basically default mode for me."

"What... What do you mean?" Sky stopped in the sidewalk, giving me a look of concern.

"Uh..." I stuttered, stopping to look back at him. "Well, my dad and I always had... issues... at home." I shrugged, trying to brush it off as not a big deal.

_But it is._

_Why am I telling him this?_

_Why do I automatically trust a stranger I've known for a day and a half?_

_Why does he_ _automatically trust a stranger he's known for a day and a half?_

"On the inside, our relationship was messy, we'd always fight." I, stupidly, continued. "But, on the outside, we pretended... to have the best father-son relationship in the world. Just so no one would think..."

I went quiet.

"Charlie..." Sky spoke, looking at me with sad, apologetic eyes.

"You know what? Forget I said anything." I scoffed, turning around to resume walking. "We haven't made it off campus, yet. Onwards! The night is still young!" I mock-screamed with a happy attitude, but, of course, Sky saw straight through it.

"Charlie, if you want to‚Äî" Sky started to speak.

"I don't." I interrupted. "I really don't."

Sky nodded and looked to the floor. I turned back around and stopped once more.

"Hey," I sighed after hesitating for a few seconds. "We both have problems. But we can figure all that shit out later, let's just, enjoy tonight. Like real people."

Sky scratched the back of his neck and nodded again.

"Real people." He nodded, boldly marching ahead in front of me.

I chuckled and joined him.

As we passed through campus in the sunset, we could hear booming music and animals partying in frat houses. Guess some people were already enjoying their college experience more than others. Once we stepped into town, our official Charlie-Sky Cloverland Tour began.

We started our journey walking under the dim streetlights of the urban city, passing honking taxis and adults on their phones rushing to get home from working late at their minimum-wage jobs. It may have been a dark night but it definitely was not a quiet one. We could hear voices of animals laughing, communicating, shouting, all the things. Cloverland has a very lively community.

It was a cool, summer night. Soon fall, then winter would come, and it wouldn't be as nice as this.

"God, this place is huge," Sky exclaimed as we looked at a map of the town.

"Yeah," I said. "But, it's actually kinda nice." Sky nodded in agreement.

"I wish I had a car, or at least my bike. I wish I'd brought it on the airplane." Sky spoke as we wandered about. "It's gonna be hell going in and out of work."

"You found an internship?" I asked.

"I'd rather not talk about it." Sky dismissed.

"Well, if you ever need help getting somewhere, I can give you a ride," I suggested.

"Thanks, Charlie," He sighed, "But, you don't have to do that."

"Oh, no, I insist. Helping people out is my jam."

Sky looked at me and flashed another smile. Man, I love it when he smiles.

_Not that I... like him in any way, I'm just... happy to make others happy._

He barely smiles, I'm glad I'm one of the few who can put him in a cheery mood, considering I'm his first real friend.

_Wait a second, does he like me?_

_I mean, I've never thought about it..._

_About him... and his sexuality..._

_What if he was... No, I promised him I wouldn't think that!_

_Well, I promised that I wouldn't think he's a faggot. If he's gay, I support him. I support all people._

_But, who knows, if he likes me, I'm fine with it._  

_I'll just tell him I'm not gay._

_Because I'm not. Not completely._

"Woah, crackhead hour, to your right." Sky whispered to me.

I looked to my right to see a bunch of teens, taking up a swingset at one of the community parks, high off of something. They were unloading nonsense out of their mouths and jumping off the swings only to tumble into the ground.

"I was about to say, 'let's go to the park' but that's not happening anytime soon." Sky continued.

"What, you don't want to join them?" I joked.

"That's not funny." Sky scoffed, running ahead to get away from the stoned teenagers.

"You're telling me you've never done any drugs in your life?" I questioned, catching up to him.

"Of course not." Sky snorted. "No drugs, no alcohol, I've never smoked, never‚Äî"

"Jesus, what are you, a narc?" I blurted.

"No, I just... can't stand doing bad things like that."

"'Doing bad things', do you hear yourself?" I laughed. "Miss Goody Two Shoes over here,"

"Shut up," Sky grunted.

"Let me guess, you've never said a 'bad word' before, either."

Sky stopped in his path. When I noticed he wasn't by my side, I turned around.

"Oh my god," I gasped. Sky rolled his eyes and kept walking. "You are such a priss!" I said, following him. "You must be lying, you've never said a curse word, not even to yourself?"

"They're insulting."

"Sky, you are adorable."

"Don't call me that!"

"It's so easy, look, fuck, shit, bitch, ass‚Äì"

"Shut up!" Sky chuckled, shoving me.

"Wow, okay! Pussy got some fire in him."

"Oh, my god. I'm gonna give you five seconds to stop this or else we're going home."

"I was just being funny!"

"Five."

"Sky, it was a joke."

"Four."

"I'm not saying anything, Sky!"

"Three."

"I'm sorry I said a bad word!"

"Two!"

"I'll take you to another park, alright? Just stop counting down, you're like my dad!"

Sky's smile disappeared. So did mine.

I looked to the floor, embarrassed that got out.

"Deal," Sky vowed. I looked up at him, glad he didn't make a big deal about it. I really respect him as a person. "Which park are we going to?"

"God, there are so many, it's annoying," I smirked.

"Take me, then."

"Alright."

After walking in silence for a bit longer, we found another community park not too far from the other one. Like I said, so many parks in this goddamn town. This one had a playground, a swing set, a gazebo, picnic tables, a field of grass with giant (probably fake) rocks, and best of all, it was empty.

I tried to entertain Sky by enjoying myself on the playground equipment. I pretended to tapdance across the rope bridge and tumble down the slide like the animals we saw earlier. Sky just watched and cringed, placing his paw to his face to hide his emotion. After I got up from the ground, Sky came towards me, licked his paw, and then touched my face.

"Woah, what are you doing?" I flinched, pushing his hand away.

"Hold still, your fur is standing on end. Probably because of the static electricity on the slide." Sky spoke softly as he began to brush my hair down around my head. His delicate paw was soothing on the surface of my fur. He doesn't have any claws. "There we go." Sky smiled, patted my shoulder, and wandered off. I stared blankly at him as he walked onto the grass field.

_I don't know how to feel about that._

_I don't know if I should feel something about that._

"Need any help?" I asked after I joined him on the field. He was trying to climb on top of the giant rock but was severely struggling.

"I got it!" Sky groaned wearily, watching his legs and patterned tail disappear behind the top surface of the rock. I snorted and climbed up the rock after him.

The top of the rock was flat. Sky helped himself by sitting down on the ledge, looking out over the landscape. I took a seat on the stone surface next to him. Our legs dangled in the wind over the edge. I looked out into the night. The rock was very tall, so the view was immaculate.

"Wow," Sky purred, taking a deep exhale, drifting into a relaxed, halcyon state.

"Yeah, wow," I repeated, looking at him.

Just seeing that blue and pink cat with his eyes closed, breathing in the harmonious air, a cool breeze flowing through his fur... I couldn't help but wonder...

_Maybe... I do like Skyler?_

_I mean, when I said he was adorable, I wasn't lying._

Shit, I've been staring too long.

"What?" He laughed, looking at me. My eyes darted away. I frantically searched for words but nothing of use came out.

"Nothing, sorry." I stuttered, panicked.

"Are you okay?" He asked, giving me a look of concern.

"Yeah. I was just thinking..." I said, making it up as I went.

"About what?" Sky questioned, leaning in.

"About..." I didn't know what to say.

I looked around for an answer until something behind him caught my eye. On the sidewalk mirroring the park was a coffee shop.

"That place. Right there." I blurted out, pointing to it.

Sky turned around to locate what I was pointing to. He squinted his eyes, trying to make out what the painted words on the glass window read.

"'Amber's," Sky stated. "'Cloverland's Best Coffee and Tea.'" He looked back to me, oddly, a little worried. "What about it?"

"Well, I was thinking," I spluttered, "What if that was, like, our hangout spot? You know, like, a place for us to chill... and talk? What if... we went there every day after our last class? Since we always have time? Like at break period?" As I said it out loud, I was starting to actually like the idea.

Sky hesitated awkwardly and then winced.

"Uh... I don't know..." Sky mumbled.

"Why not?"

"It's just so far from the apartment..."

"I have my car, remember?"

"'Cloverland's Best Coffee', I'm sure they're only saying that just for customers..."

Wait, why is he suddenly awkward again?

_I was starting to sense some... bullshit..._

_Wait, does he think I like him because I was staring for so long?_

"What's wrong?" I interrogated.

"Wrong? Nothing's wrong. What would be wrong?" Sky fretted, scratching the back of his neck.

"You seem wrong."

"No, I don't."

"Yes, you do."

"Nothing's wrong."

"You're sweating, Sky."

"It's nothing, just hot out, you were right, hehe."

"Sky? You can tell me, alright?" I reassured, placing my hand on his shoulder.

"Okay, fine..." As he started to speak, I braced for more awkwardness.

_What will happen if he asks if I like him? That will probably consume our friendship, and I wouldn't want to do that to him, he just got here._

"I work there." Sky admitted, scrunching his face.

_Okay, not what I was expecting... but still caught me a little off guard._

"You work there?" I inquired, taking my paw away from his shoulder.

"Yeah. I work the register." He confessed, letting out an awkward laugh.

"That's your internship?" I jeered.

"I like to make little doodles on the coffee cups! The couple that owns it, super nice by the way, pay me extra to decorate the interior, liven up the place, you know?" Sky whined.

I chuckled, dropping my head down in relief.

"I think that's great, Sky," I sighed. "I'm not judging."

"I could get you a job if you like," Sky shrugged.

"Oh, no, that's okay." I objected lethargically.

"I'll give you a good recommendation, we need an extra set of hands anyway. _I_ need an extra set of hands."

"I said it's okay, Sky."

"Please, Charlie. You've done so much for me, it's the only way I could pay you back."

I sighed, looking into his big, bright pink eyes.

"Please?" He said one last time.

I couldn't say no to him.

"Fine." I chuckled.

"Yes! Thank you!" Sky cheered, kicking his tiny feet in the air. I smiled, happy to make him happy once again. It's like my job. "You won't regret this." He beamed, patting me on the back.

"I'm sure I won't."

I'm sure I won't.

## Charlie

### SEPTEMBER

One month of college: officially completed. It wasn't very noteworthy, other than the fact that we actually started to begin our assignments.

It was about 1:49 when Sky and I left to go to his _(soon to be our)_ job at Amber's. The owners scheduled a meeting for today since it was the only time they had available. As we walked through the heavy sunlight to my car parked down the road, I had a revelation.

"I just realized," I exclaimed, turning around, walking backwards to face Sky during our conversation. "I don't have your number," I admitted, taking my phone out of my pocket, ready to jot down digits.

"Oh, I don't have a phone." Sky claimed.

"Seriously?" I gasped, putting my phone back into my shorts.

"Yeah, they kinda scare me," Sky said. "Technology, social media, all that jazz."

"God, you felines are so paranoid of everything." I jeered, tossing my keys up and down. Sky tilted his head at me and smirked. "Literally, I can throw a piece of paper at you and you'd jump ten feet and skitter away."

"Well, fear is a useful trait to have." Sky boasted. "Without it, we can't _see_ what's ahead in order to avoid upcoming incidents or tragedies. Unlike, you canines..."

The second Sky made that remark, I backed straight into a trash can, tripping and falling onto the concrete. Sky stopped in front of me and bent down on his knees.

"You go full-steam ahead." He smiled, holding his hand out for me.

_Damn, that was well-played._

I sighed with laughter and grabbed his hand. He picked me up from the sidewalk and brushed all the excess rubbish off my back.

"Ooh, nice car. I love Mini Coopers!" Sky gushed, running ahead to take shotgun.

_I swear, this cat is gonna be the death of me._

After a ten-minute car ride of me and Sky arguing whether cats or dogs were better, we finally arrived at Amber's. It was a small coffee shop at the corner of the street. A small bell attached to the door frame jingled delightfully as Sky opened the front glass door. As we stepped inside, a sweet brush of cool air hit me like entering an ice cream parlor in the middle of a hot, summer day. The interior was charming and delightful, the walls were painted a bright baby blue, framed photos adorned the walls to emit a home-like vibe to the establishment, a long desk was joined by bar stools stood beside the large, painted windows, a massive, comfy couch with a coffee table and two recliners occupied the living space, and lastly, tables and chairs were littered throughout for customers. It was very welcoming, _seriously_ welcoming; I mean, I forgot to mention the bean bag on the floor next to the couch! There were a few people sitting with their coffee, a few coming and going.

"Hey, Sky," A labrador, who looked about the same age as us, got both Sky's and my attention. "Your shift started, I'm outta here."

"Got it, Hayden." Sky sighed, then turning to me. "Be right back."

He lifted up the counter trapdoor and walked behind the register. Whoever 'Hayden' was, took off his work uniform and left in a hurry. Sky took an apron and cap off the wall and dressed in it. He grabbed an oval-shaped name tag from a painted bucket and pinned it to his shirt.

I walked up to the counter and looked at the name tag.

"'Skyler.'" I read aloud.

"Yeah, don't make a big deal out of it." Sky whispered.

"I gotta say, you look adorable in that outfit," I whispered in response.

"Stop calling me that, it's annoying."

"Sheesh, alright," I groaned, putting my hands in the air.

I looked up at the three chalkboards hanging from the ceiling. They had their menu's options with prices written down on them, accompanied by tiny doodles of coffee cups and cupcakes with smiley faces.

"Yes, I did those," Sky mumbled, writing something down on a clipboard.

"Expertly... drawn?" I said, directing my eyes from the menu to the glass compartments full of baked goods and pastries. I could probably go for something to eat.

"Henri Amber and his wife don't get here until 2, so do you want to order anything?" Sky asked, waving his pen around.

"Can I get an iced coffee?" I answered.

"Okie-doke." Sky nodded, writing down my order on a plastic cup. "Oh, and what's your name again?" He joked.

"Charlie Sheen." I laughed, looking back down to the pastries. "And, can I also get a croissant?"

"You got it."

After I received my order, I sat in the chair closest to the counter. No one would mind if I spoke out loud to Sky since they were either using headphones or working on something important. Or they just didn't care. I looked at my coffee cup and saw a little doodle of myself done in sharpie on the plastic. I smiled at Sky as he winked at me.

"So, if we're gonna be working together," I said, taking a bite of the flaky croissant, "I think we should get to know each other better."

"Eat with your muzzle closed," Sky said, tidying up the counter. I gulped my food down and took a sip of the iced coffee.

"So, do you want to start?" I questioned.

"Start with what?" Sky reflected.

"Conversation!"

"How do you even do a conversation?"

"I don't know, how do normal people talk?"

"We are not normal people." Sky scoffed.

"I guess I'll start then," I suggested. Sky held his hand out to me, letting me take the stage. "Uhhhh.... Here's a weird fact about myself: my middle name is Klondike."

"Like the ice cream bar?"

"Yeah, it was my mom's favorite dessert, so she insisted."

"That's sweet."

"It was my favorite, too," I spoke. "Yeah, my mom really got me hooked on those things. I had seventeen of them instead of a birthday cake one year for my eighth birthday."

"Seventeen?!"

"I know, right?"

"I love cake, I dunno how ice cream compares."

"Ice cream is amazing, what are you talking about?"

"I meant for your birthday. Birthday cake is way more iconic."

"Compromise: Ice cream cake." Sky shook his head as he chuckled, wiping a metal cup. "I turned twenty a few months ago."

"Well, I'm eighteen."

"How are you eighteen and we're in our freshman year of college together?"

"I skipped a grade in school."

"Ah. Ironically, I was held back a year in elementary school. But, anyway, yay! I'm two years older than you so I have more privilege!" I cheered. Sky rolled his eyes and continued to wipe down the counter. "My birthday is in June."

"My birthday's on Valentine's Day!" Sky boasted, his jaw-dropping, hands in the air, thinking he had won some sort of battle.

"Really? Wow! That's adorable!"

"You really need to vary your adjectives for me."

"But the word describes you so well," I whined, placing my head into my hands.

"Is your mom still around?" Sky wondered.

I went quiet, pondering if I should tell him or not. I got up and came to the counter.

"No," I semi-whispered. "She isn't."

"Oh," Sky consoled.

"She left home when I was young."

"Seriously?"

"Yeah. When I was eight."

Sky hesitated. "Before or after your birthday?" He asked finally. I looked up at him to answer, but then he interrupted me. "Sorry, that was a dumb question."

"No, it's okay." I sighed, looking at my reflection on the polished counter. "She left... _on_ my birthday."

"Oh my god," Sky gasped quietly. "Charlie, that's terrible. I'm so sorry."

"Don't be. You didn't kill her."

"Hm?" Sky squeaked, his eyebrows tilting downward.

"Uh..." I mumbled. "Apparently, she died in a plane crash. As she was leaving."

"Charlie..."

"Please, don't waste your condolences on me. I've heard it all."

"I take it your dad didn't come out of that so... cheery?"

I shook my head slowly, turning it to the floor.

"Anyway," I inhaled, changing the subject with a smile on my face. "What's your story? Tell me about your family. Hopefully, they're better than mine."

"Well," Sky exhaled deeply. "My parents are very caring and they love me deeply. They always wanted the best for me, even if they didn't really pay too much attention to my life..."

"How could they not pay attention to someone as incredible as you?"

"They were focused on other things..."

"Like what? What could be more important than their own son?"

"Their own son..." Sky mumbled so low that I almost couldn't make out what he was saying.

"Hm?"

Sky looked up at me for a moment.

"Nothing."

I'll admit, the questions I was asking were definitely coming from my experience with parents.

"I don't know why I'm complaining, I'm sorry‚Äî" Sky sighed, shaking his head.

"No, no, no, it's fine," I whispered. "Do you have any siblings or anything?"

Sky looked to the floor and faltered. He tapped his foot a few times before answering the question.

"Not that I know of," Sky chuckled awkwardly. I was a little confused at first, but then I just brushed it off. "Family wasn't a problem, but _school_ was a nightmare."

"Really?" I puzzled. "You always seemed like a good-grades-bookworm-teachers-pet kind of dude to me."

"N-No, I... I was. Like I said, I skipped a grade... I meant my _classmates_ were a nightmare. I was bullied, a lot. They called me a you-know-what, insulted me for the way I looked‚Äî" Sky whispered to me.

"'The way you look'? What's wrong with the way you look?" I defended.

"Would you keep your voice down?"

"Sorry."

"I just... I used to wear clothes in bright colors. Like pink and stuff‚Äî"

"Just because a guy wears pink doesn't mean he's gay."

"That's not what they thought."

"Is that why you wear mostly black now?"

"They also said... mean things like..." Sky whimpered. "Well, they always said that I was a... girl in a boy's body."

"Understandable." After that statement, I got a painful slap in the arm by the one-and-only Sky Clawfield. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry! It was a joke! Just trying to lighten the mood!"

"Yeah, sure, Charlie, lighten the mood like you always do. So, that's basically why I have no friends and no life and no hope of being a normal person and keep mostly to myself, alright? The end." Sky grunted, face-palming himself in frustration. I didn't expect him to get like this.

I sat there, feeling out of place, deciding whether or not to comfort him.

_It's 2:07, where the hell is Henri Amber and his fucking wife?! I don't like to see Sky sad... or upset... or disturbed... I like it when he's happy._

Sky looked at me, his pink eyes full of regret. He sighed once more and adjusted the way he was standing. He couldn't face me at the moment, so he held his head down.

"I'm sorry." Sky sniffled. "I just... I have these... outbursts whenever I have a rush of anxiety, I... I'm really sorry."

"It's alright, Sky." I placed my paw on his.

_Shit, I just held his hand._

Me and Sky both looked at our paws on top of each other, not able to move or react. We just stood there, silently having an emotional breakdown in our minds.

"Heh," Sky blurted, pulling his hand away from mine. "The perks of being a feline. You have constant, constant mood swings."

"The perks of being a canine," I responded. "You do things without thinking."

Sky and I both looked at each other until we burst out laughing.  

After the laughter came to an end, I noticed that Sky was staring at me intricately, as if he were trying to figure something out about me.

"What?" I asked.

"You're not like other people, you know?" Sky looked up at me. "You're not like every clich√©, empty-headed alpha male. I'm sure your girlfriend loves you."

"Girlfriend? What girlfriend?" I chuckled, confused as to why he believed I had a girlfriend.

"The... The girl you talk to on the phone. In the morning. I heard you call her every day for the past month."

_Cassie._

"Oh, oh, no, Sky, she's not my girlfriend."

"Really?"

"Yeah, no, we're just really good friends."

"That's funny, you always seemed like the kind of guy that every girl would just eat up."

"What distinguishes me as that kind of guy?"

"I dunno, you're, uh... You're smart. Charming. You're artsy, you're not bland, no, you have an eye for things. You put effort into what you do." Sky described while not maintaining eye contact, still wiping down the glass barriers on the counter.

I felt like I was blushing.

"And, you're... Well, you know..."

"What?"

"Don't make me say it."

"Tell me, please."

Skyler scowled, rolling his head back.

"You're handsome." He mumbled, taking an eensy-teensy glimpse at me before darting his eyes away at the last second. "I would've thought you were too far down the dating hole."

I only noticed then that my tail was wagging like crazy.

At that moment, we could hear the bell by the front door ring as a middle-aged cheetah in khakis and a brown shirt walked in.

"Henri!" Sky called to the man.

"Hello, Sky!" Henri replied. "Who is this?" He said to me. I shifted in my stance to look more professional.

"This is Charlie, the one I was talking to you about," Sky said, then looking at me. "Charlie, this is Henri Amber, the owner of the shop."

"Oh, of course! It's a pleasure to meet you," Henri said, shaking my hand. "So, I've only got a few minutes, but we definitely need an extra set of help and Sky has said so many good things about you already, so it'd be impossible to mess this interview up!"

"He said... good things?" I muttered, turning my head back to Sky, who blushed and looked to the floor.

"Well, of course!" Henri beamed. "If it's Sky's opinion, we trust it. He's helped us out so much recently."

"We love Sky." Came from a black panther in a striped shirt and dark overalls as she entered the building. She was about the same age as Henri.

"Ah, Charlie, this is my wife."

"Oh, nice to meet you," I greeted, reaching out to shake hands. "So do you actually have a name or do you only go by 'Henri's Wife'?" I joked.

We all laughed together. From that moment on, I knew things were going to get better.

\~~~

Later that night, before me and Sky went to sleep, I sat in my bed, tossing the empty coffee cup up and down.

"Safe to say, I got the job." I bragged as Sky came into the room in his pajamas.

"Looking forward to working with you," Sky laughed, crawling underneath his blankets.

"Hey," I called, examining the drawing of myself on the coffee cup. It was way too lifelike to be a doodle. It's an actual work of art. He's amazingly talented. "Your drawings on the cups are cute and all, but you should really put your work out there. I mean, this is incredible! It's me!" I said, pointing at the plastic cup.

"Oh, I don't know," Sky muttered, laying down on his side to face me. "I don't really like to share my art."

"Well, why not? With your skills, you could become famous... and rich!" I exclaimed, tossing the cup to him. Sky flinched and held his hand out to block the cup, but it hit his head anyway and fell to the floor.

"I'm really self-conscious about what I create." Sky admitted, scratching his head.

"Then why'd you come to this fancy-pants school anyway?"

"To learn more. I make this art for myself, no one else." Sky sighed, facing the ceiling. "It's a hobby that only I understand. It's what makes me, me. Every piece of work I make needs to be perfect because that's how I want it to be. I _seriously_ hate it when I try to make something and the end product is unsatisfying to me, but then, peers tell me that it's fine. Well, it's not fine. Not to me. It needs to be perfect."

"You are perfect."

_Fuck._

I don't know how that slipped out of my mouth. I immediately covered my mouth and closed my eyes. I didn't want to face him, scared of what his response would be.

"You don't know that, Charlie," Sky whispered.

I opened my eyes and looked at him. He was still there, staring at the ceiling.

"Shall I get the light?" I mocked in a fake-accent after a few seconds of silence. Sky yawned and nodded.

I got up, flicked off the light switch, then returned to my bed. I stripped down to my boxers and settled underneath the covers, lying on my side, facing Sky. He got his headphones and placed them around his ears.

I closed my eyes, ready for another quiet, dreamy night. I slowly drifted into sleep. But something awoke me. The sound of the bed creaking and shifting. I open my eyes to see Sky, shoving something into place underneath the pillows of his bed. I couldn't see what, though.

"The fuck are you doing?" I laughed, sitting up in bed.

"The sheets fell off the sides of the bed so they clumped together to form a lump underneath me and it's really uncomfortable so I'm fixing it." He moaned, trying to pull the sheets around the corner of the mattress.

"Sheesh, okay, princess," I jeered, laying back down. "Put a pea under the mattress while you're at it."

"If you were a cat you'd understand why this is irritating."

"Oh, of course, because you felines are just so precious, sensitive, and delicate."

"Oh, yeah?" Sky scoffed, sitting up to face me. "Well, on the other hand, canines are sloppy and lazy. They have no care or respect for both themselves or others."

"You better watch it."

"Oh, 'cause you're such a threat."

"I am."

"Hm."

"Am I not that menacing?" I hesitated. "I could fucking gobble you up in one bite."

"Then that's twenty years in prison for you."

"Oh‚Äî"

"Twenty. Years." Sky interrupted. "Prison. Barely sleeping on a hard, scratchy, cold mattress, you think back to our conversation and you take back everything you just said‚Äî'cause, hey, huskies like you need their beauty rest, but this bed is just so painful and I'm just sooooo precious."  

_Holy shit, who knew Sky could be intimidating._

_No one did._

"Damn, you're good," I whispered.

"Good night, Charlie."

# 9. AMBER'S: CLOVERLAND'S BEST COFFEE AND TEA

\~~~

## Skyler

### OCTOBER

Another month has passed since Charlie got hired where I work. I think we make a pretty good duo, him being my barista partner and all. Henri and his wife have noticed that sales have gone only slightly up recently. If that was because of us? We still don't know. As for college, things have been going swimmingly. Claire is always happy to see me in Mixed Media and we get lunch together almost every day now, along with Charlie. I haven't paid attention to Jonathan a lot, but he does occasionally join us for lunch. Not gonna lie, he and Claire have both been pining after each other ever since the day they met. Other than that, everything has been okay.

Everything has been, surprisingly, okay.

I feel like I have real friends now, and I don't know whether to be happy about it or to start crying for not making any sooner. Having people to hang out with is the best! I always thought all animals were the same: cruel and hurtful. No one even bothered to bat an eye towards me throughout my entire social life.

Anyway, before Charlie and I headed out to work today, we heard a commotion outside. Everyone in the house did, really. Me, Charlie, Jonathan, Dylan, Byron, and Milo, all stood out on the front lawn to see what was happening. Turns out, the Cloverland marching band decided to throw the entire campus a little performance. I guess this was planned. This is probably why the streets got closed down this morning.

They had been walking down the streets of CIVA all day, and now they just got to our terrain. Everyone else on the block walked out on their front steps to take in the view and applaud. There they all were, in their red uniforms, accompanied by their great, grand music instruments, playing their great, grand marching band theme song.

It was definitely an occasion to cheer and applaud them, they weren't too terrible. Everyone on the block was howling their lungs out. It actually got everyone in _our_ apartment to stand together in the same location for once. I could actually see my roommates in full view for the first time in two months. Byron and Dylan started cheering and clapping, screaming, "Go Timberwolves!" at their highest volume setting.

"Who are the Timberwolves?" I asked Charlie, tugging on his shirt since he couldn't hear me over the shouting. "What's going on?"

"The marching band is honoring our football team!" Dylan answered for Charlie, jumping up and down energetically.

"Well, more like promoting it," Charlie added while clapping. "There's a game coming up in November."

"CIVA has a football team?" I asked, eyes widening in shock.

"Yeah, me, Dylan and Byron are all members!" Jonathan informed, nudging me. "How did you miss that? We all live in the same house."

"Probably because he doesn't care for sports," Byron snickered. Dylan exhaled a breathless laugh, gasping for air and grabbing hold to Byron so he wouldn't fall over. Charlie face-palmed, shaking his head.

_I don't get it._

"Yeah, those three just got recruited," Charlie continued. "Football season is on, so I guess the marching band wanted to show their appreciation."

"Let's hope you actually win," Milo muttered. We all looked back at him, remembering that he existed. I always thought I was the most forgettable person in the room.

"Uh... This is cool and all..." Jonathan mumbled awkwardly. "But, I got to go somewhere."

"What? You're gonna miss the fight anthem!" Byron complained. All Jonathan did was shrug and wince.

"Sorry, boys, but it's my internship. Videotape it for me so I can watch it when I get back!" Jonathan called, running off and down the sidewalk in a hurry.

Me and Charlie looked at each other, a little confused as to why he was acting so weird, but then we just brushed it off as nothing to worry about.

"Speaking of," Charlie whispered to me. "We gotta get to Amber's. Shift starts soon."

I nodded, zipping up my sweatshirt before taking off. It had gotten only a tiny bit colder since autumn was upon us, all the trees were starting to slightly change color, but I still freeze up easily.

"Alright, we're off to work, see you sissies later!" Charlie waved to Byron, Dylan, and Milo as we left the premises and got in Charlie's car.

\~~~

"You're telling me, you've never drunk coffee before?" Charlie questioned in astonishment as he blended a customer's frappuccino. It wasn't very crowded today, so Charlie and I had time to chat.

"I'm more of a milk or fruit juice type of guy," I responded, placing bills in the cash register.

"What kind of person works at a coffee shop and has never ordered a coffee before?"

"He's standing right in front of you," I smirked, closing the money compartment.

"How do you even live with yourself?" Charlie whined, pouring the liquid into a plastic cup.

"I've had iced tea before, if that helps," I said, leaning on the counter and placing my hand on my hip.

"How dare you," Charlie chuckled. We both began to laugh in unison as the doorbell rang, informing me to prepare for another order.

I grabbed a slip of paper and looked up at the two customers waiting at the counter.

"Hi, welcome to Amber's, how may I help‚Äî" I greeted, before immediately stopping to see who was in front of me.

_Jonathan and Claire._

I was shocked. Why? Still don't know because of how shocked I was. We all shared the same reaction, a blank stare with our mouths slightly gaping open.

"H-Hey, bestie!" Claire stuttered, awkwardly shifting her paws on the counter.

"Hi?" I echoed in the same embarrassing fashion.

"Jonathan, Claire!" Charlie smiled weirdly, joining my side. His eyes flashed me a quick look that said, 'holy shit'.

"Hey, boys!" Jonathan murmured, moving his hand away from Claire's.

"This is... your internship?" I interrogated, trying not to burst out laughing.

"Simp," Charlie muffled under his breath with two quick coughs. I swiftly smacked him in the shoulder.

"No... I just..." Jonathan stifled as though he had a speech impediment.

"He was going to his internship, but then we bumped into each other and decided to get coffee..." Claire spoke, trying to make an excuse.

"Cut the bullshit, is this a date?" Charlie intruded.

"Charlie!" I gasped, pushing him back. Jonathan lowered his head into his hands as Claire blushed and looked to the floor.

"We... didn't know you guys worked here," Jonathan confessed gravelly.

"Yeah, we didn't tell anyone," I noted. "And we won't tell anyone else about this either, if you don't want us to," I defended, shaking my head.

"We were going to tell you guys," Claire said. "But we decided to keep it a secret for a little while."

"'For a little while?' How long have you two been dating?" I whispered in shock.

"A week," Jonathan revealed.

"A week and you never spilled the beans?" I chuckled.

"Nah, I get it," Charlie smirked. "It's more fun in secret, isn't it?"

"Funny you say that." Jonathan smiled.

"Huh?" I asked, tilting my head.

"I'm just saying, recently, you two have been hanging out more than usual‚Äî"

"Okay, we're ready to order!" Claire interrupted Jonathan, loudly.

Both me and Charlie shifted awkwardly, being placed in that same awkward position they were in a few moments ago.

\~~~

Charlie and I sat on our knees, hiding behind the counter. Our heads peeked up slightly over the surface every few seconds to spy on Jonathan and Claire as they sipped their coffee on the couch. They probably knew we were watching them, but it was fun to pretend we were on a stakeout.

"They're not doing anything, they're just sitting there, awkwardly," Charlie whispered.

"Yeah, probably because they don't like it when people keep tabs on them," I answered, moving to sit with my back to the counter. "This is getting sad." I moaned in disappointment.

"Hey," Charlie stood up, holding his hand out to pull me up with him. "What Jonathan said earlier..."

"Oh, don't worry about it," I scoffed, rising to my feet, giving up the stakeout.

"It's just, I've known him for a while, he says stupid things like that constantly, it doesn't mean anything." Charlie fretted.

"Fear not," I said sarcastically. "I get it."

"I just didn't want to put you in an uncomfortable position or anything‚Äî"

"That's what she said."

"Stop," Charlie grumbled.

I stopped.

"Oh, no," Charlie winced, dropping to his knees again. "Get a load of tweedle-dee and tweedle-dumb. 10 o'clock."

I looked back to the couch to see Claire and Jonathan finally kissing. I dropped back down to Charlie's level, giggling with excitement.

"Oh, would you look at that," I gasped, examining the make-out session. "A happy, healthy couple. Good to know those exist these days."

"What the hell are they doing?"

"I think they are battling with their mouths." I laughed.

"Jesus, we looked away for like a second, and that's all the time it took."

"What can I say, young," I cleared my throat, "sexually-active children can never keep their hands to themselves in these dwelling times."

"You think we'll ever be like that?" Charlie joked, looking at me.

"Ugh, shut up." I snorted, cringing.

"What?" Charlie asked, his whole body facing me full-on. "You don't think we'd make a cute couple?"

"Seriously, stop! It's not funny." I griped, standing on my feet and turning to attend to the cash register.

That was when I felt Charlie's arms wrap around my waist and pull me into a hug.

"C'mon, tell me you're not feeling anything between us!" Charlie laughed.

That triggered something.

Something deep down inside of me.

Nothing good.

I started to recall how people used to bully me... and that other memory.

_Was he trying to bully me, too? Have I really been falling for his tricks? His friendliness... his smile... Has it all just been a ruse? Has he been trying to set me up? Trying to be my friend for the past month... just so he could abuse and torture me?_

All the memories were coming back. All of them.

_The bullies, the trauma, the man in the alleyway... the way he grabbed me... the things I had screamed... I had said, 'don't touch me'. I had said it aloud._

"DON'T TOUCH ME!" I shrieked, kicking him off my back. I turned around vigorously and slammed into the wall. Charlie stood back, startled. He held his hands up, taking a few steps away.

"Sky... I-I was only joking." He stuttered, alarmed by my sudden change in mood.

"A-A joke too far!" I chastised, breathing heavily. I looked to my left to see everyone in the room staring at us. Claire and Jonathan staring at us. They all stared in concern.

I had to get out of there.

I shoved past Charlie and lifted the counter trapdoor. Charlie grabbed my arm.

"W-Wait, where are you going?" Charlie worried.

"Bathroom." I snapped, pulling my arm away from his grasp violently.

I pushed through the employees-only doorway and rushed into the cold bathroom. I locked the door and sat on the toilet seat. My eyes watered as I tried to steady my breathing.

_I should've known not to trust Charlie. Not to trust Jonathan or Claire. Not to trust anyone. I thought I made friends, only for them all to lie to me. Tears streamed down my face. I pulled my shirt collar over my head and rocked back and forth._

_What just happened?_

I stayed in that bathroom for the rest of my shift.

# 10. TEN FINGERS AND CLAWS

\~~~

## Skyler

I heard a soft knock on the door followed by Charlie's voice.

"Sky?" He spoke. "Are you in there?"

I sat there, tapping my feet in rhythm to a song I heard a few days ago... _I can't remember the name... or the artist... but it was a good song..._

"Shift's over," Charlie's voice spoke again. "No one else is here, everyone left. You wanna head home?"

_Why is this bathroom so scary-looking? The whole interior, walls and doors included, look like they're made out of metal. It's so cold, too. Is it possible that I've walked into a freezer? That's probably what it was originally..._

"The doors unlocked," The voice spoke once more... "Should I come in?"

_Why do my eyes hurt so much? Maybe because you've been crying for more than an hour, dummy. But, why? Why do you get so emotional over the tiniest things? Why do you overthink everything? Maybe you did have friends... Maybe it was just a joke..._

The door in front of me unlatched and opened slowly. I didn't look up to see him in the doorway.

"Hey..." He said.

I guess my body decided to take control of all my actions.  

I didn't give him a chance to talk. I got up, walked past him, took off my apron, cap, and nametag, put them in their respective places, grabbed the keys off the counter, opened the door. I decided not to listen to Charlie's voice calling for me from behind. I'm pretty good at blocking out the sounds around me, with or without headphones.

_But why am I doing this, though? Why am I choosing to shut him out?_

_I dunno... Something... You'll find a reason later, Sky, just stay mad at him and it will all work out..._

I waited for Charlie to leave the empty coffee shop. Once he stepped out, I shut the door and locked it. I walked back home on foot through the setting sun. It wasn't until minutes later that I realized Charlie wasn't following me.

Good.

That basically proves that he doesn't care about me. This is why I should be mad at him. I found my answer.

That was until I heard a car screech up next to me. I looked to my right to see Charlie, in his car, on the street, right next to the sidewalk. He lowered his window as he slowed down to the speed of my footsteps.

"Sky, get in," Charlie said.

I looked ahead and walked faster. Charlie sped up.

"Sky, let's talk about this," He suggested.

_Keep walking, Sky._

"Look, I'm sorry, I know you're sensitive, and I know I should've stopped when you said to."

_Is that seriously why I'm mad at him? He was only playing around..._

_No, keep walking, Sky._

_Don't face him._

_Keep walking. It's what you always do. It's how you get out of situations. It's how you avoided abuse from those awful kids in high school. You just kept walking._

"Please get in the car, Sky."

_Keep walking._

_You know you have to keep walking._

_It doesn't matter how badly you want to face him._

_It doesn't matter how badly you want to get in his car._

_It doesn't matter how badly you want to kiss him._

_Keep walking._

Right before I was about to cross a sidewalk, Charlie swerved in front of me, stopping me in my tracks. He may have almost ran me over, but I don't really care. He stopped for me.

"Sky," Charlie said as he walked out of the car in the middle of the road, placing his hands on my shoulders. "I'm sorry."

_Don't look into his eyes._

_Damn it, Sky!_

_But..._

_They're just so..._

_Beautiful..._

_That natural brown, hazel color..._

I didn't even notice the tear falling down my face until Charlie pointed it out.

"Why are you crying?" He asked.

_Because I love you._

"I don't know," I whimpered. "I don't know why I'm crying."

Charlie stood there, confused, still holding me by my shoulders, making sure I'm safe and okay.

_Goddammit, why the hell are you crying, Sky? You're such a brat! You're pushing away the only person that ever really wanted to see the real you..._

"It's not fair," I sniffled, my voice breaking.

"What's not fair?"

"That I have to put you through this. You don't deserve it."

"What do you mean?"

"Why do you want to be my friend, Charlie?"

"Because you're talented, funny, creative, and an overall good person."

"But I'm not."

"But you are."

"How do you do that?"

"Do what?"

"How are you so positive? All the time? How can you see the good in people?"

"Because I decide to look for it."

I closed my eyes, wanting to sink through the floor and fall into a void of nothingness, just for Charlie to come after me. To reach for me and grab me and pull me back up to the surface.

"Get in the car, Sky," Charlie said one last time. "Please."

I opened my eyes. I did what he said.

\~~~

The entire car ride was silent, but I appreciated it. Charlie gave me time to think even though I didn't deserve it.

Suddenly, we were magically back in our room. _How did time change so quickly? I was just in his car... Now, I'm here... The two places where I feel the safest..._

Somehow, I managed to change into my pajamas and get into bed. But not under the covers. I looked down to see myself sitting upright on my mattress.

_How am I here? Why am I here? Am I even here?_

I looked around the room. _Yup, this is my apartment, detective._ It felt warmer than usual...

That's when Charlie entered the room.

"Hey, there." He yawned, sitting on the edge of my bed, making sure I had my space. "You wanna talk now?"

I nodded sleepily, laying down onto my pillows, facing the ceiling.

_There was a crack in it I never noticed. A chip in the paint. I wonder how it got there._

"Why am I so emotional, Charlie?" I asked the ceiling.

"You're a cat, Sky. It's common for cats to have mood swings."

"My mom makes me take pills every morning," I admitted. "To control my behavior. Because of my species. They don't seem to help."

"You can't control it."

"What if I could?"

"What do you mean?"

"What if there was a way for me to control my emotions?"

"Well, Sky," Charlie scoffed, calmly and casually laying beside me in the bed. Shockingly, I didn't mind it. I wanted it. "It's not, entirely, possible for you to 'control your emotions'. We can't turn off how we feel, it's how we were made. We have brains and this is their purpose."

"But can't I minimize it, at least? Water it down, dilute it, anything, so it's not so 'in my face' all the time?"

"Well, what are some ways to calm down when you're emotional?"

I had to think this over. There weren't a lot of options for me.

"Well... My mom used to make me do 'art therapy', but I don't always have a paintbrush and easel on hand, you know?"

Charlie nodded, followed by a quiet chuckle.

"What?" I asked.

"There's this one thing my mom used to do to me when I was about seven," He smiled. I could tell he was thinking back to his good days, judging by how much he was daydreaming at the moment.

"What was it?" I asked.

"Oh, it's a little embarrassing." Charlie blushed.

"Spill, dude." I laughed.

"Well, whenever I would get sad or emotional, my mom would lift up my shirt and trace circles around my stomach until I would calm down. It would always tickle a bit, but it would feel so soothing and relaxing..." Charlie gushed. I smiled, wondering what his childhood must've been like before his mother... passed.

I started to think back to my childhood. _There was this one thing my parents would make me do whenever I started to struggle with my feelings. When I couldn't focus and everything hurt my head... Man, what was it? I really wish I could remember... Oh, yes!_

I lifted my paws up to the ceiling.

I spread out my fingers.

I took a deep breath.

"Ten fingers," I counted. Charlie watched as I labeled the parts of my body out.

"Five fingers on each paw.

"Two paws.

"One paw on each arm.

"Two arms.

"One torso.

"One neck.

"One head.

"Two ears.

"Two legs.

"One foot on each leg.

"Two feet.

"Four toes on each foot.

"Eight toes.

"One tail."

As I read each part of my body out loud, I touched or wiggled them. When I mentioned my feet, I kicked them in the air. When I mentioned my tail, I pulled it out from underneath me, hugging it and giggling like a girl.

Charlie looked so wonderstruck... and inspired...

_Heh, anything can amaze this husky._

He put his paws up to the ceiling just like I did.

"Ten claws," Charlie counted. I blushed in response to him following my actions. "Five claws on each paw. Two paws. One paw on each arm. Two arms. One torso. One neck. One head. Two ears. Two legs. One foot on each leg. Two feet. Four toes on each foot. Eight toes. One tail."

Charlie hesitated a moment before continuing. "Two eyes," I chuckled as he went on. "One nose. One muzzle. A few teeth, and finally, one billion, trillion strands of fur!"

"There we go," I laughed. Charlie looked at me, beaming.

_Oh my lord, he's so handsome. That smile... I can't..._

_I can't..._

I can't do this anymore.

  

"I think I'm gay, Charlie."

  

He didn't respond.

I mean, I didn't need him too.

I had my eyes completely shut as I spoke every word, every syllable of that godforsaken sentence. I said it, out loud.

It felt good.

It felt really, really good.

  

"I'm bisexual." Charlie confessed.

That reply opened my eyes.

We both stared up at the ceiling.

We didn't bother to look at each other; not that it would be awkward or embarrassing; but that if the slightest ounce of eye-contact was shared between us... other-worldly circumstances would occur.

I couldn't let that happen. I can't let us waste this beautiful moment with something that we could regret. I knew that Charlie understood it too. We both knew.

"Your mattress is way comfier than mine," Charlie said to the ceiling.

"Is it just me, or have those cracks in the ceiling always been there?" I said to the roof.

It felt like torture.

I had to withstand the urge.

But... Maybe I could do something else... Something that won't tip us over the edge...

My five fingers crawled over to his.

I held his hand.

His larger fingers surrounded mine and suffocated them tightly.

There we were, sitting in my bed, paw in paw, staring at the ceiling.

Ten fingers and claws, united.

## Skyler

Nothing else really happened that night, Charlie returned to his bed and I slept in mine. The morning after went as normal, but something felt off. As Charlie and I got up for the day, we could sense some sort of tension occurring between us... A strong connection tying us together that has oddly never been there until last night's fiasco.

We had a greater bond, but now was not the time to investigate it. We had to get to school.

We gave each other complicated glances as we went our separate ways to get to our 8 AM classes.

I didn't think much of it.

I don't think I want to.

Life just kinda feels, like, it's paused at the moment. A gray area.

I feel like I'm waiting for something, something to happen to me, but I don't know what it is yet.

\~~~

"Hey, bestie!" Claire beamed, jumping energetically into the seat next to me in Mixed Media class at 10. I smiled, tapping my pen on the table I was resting my head on. "So, I just wanted to say, I'm sorry again for not telling you about me and Jonathan."

"Oh, no, don't be," I begged, picking myself up to comfort her. "I totally support you two. You guys make a cute couple."

"Oh, good." Claire sighed, settling into the chair comfortably.

"Tell me about him! Is he nice to you? He better be, if he's not, I'll murder him. I will."

"Oh, Lord, he's an angel," Claire swooned. "I'm, fucking, surprised by how soft he is."

"He's soft, huh?"

"Yeah, I know, right? I was legitimately caught off guard, considering the facts that he's a football player and his friends are terrible..." Claire ranted, counting her fingers.

"His friends?"

"You know, Dylan and Byron?"

"Oh, yeah," I assured. "I think they hate me."

"At least he has one good friend. Charlie." Claire spoke, nudging me. I nodded, looking at my shoes. "Speaking of, what happened yesterday? You kinda freaked out on him."

"Oh, yeah," I mumbled, leaning back into my chair. "Something just kinda happened and it triggered something unusual inside of me... It's no big deal, though. We're okay now."

"You should ask him out."

My eyes widened as I darted my head towards her, startled by that approach.  

"I... Wha..." I faltered.

_Why can't I respond to her?_

"What? You think I don't notice all the sexual tension happening between you two? I've got a massive gaydar, dude, and it just goes wild every time I see you two together."

_I couldn't speak. Why can't I speak?_

"Whenever you and Charlie talk, I'm always like, 'God, just fuck each other already, like, what is this, Riverdale?'"

_Why can't I answer her? Why can't I scold her for saying something... so... intrusive and embarrassing?_

"But, seriously, you guys would make a cute couple. I'm not joking, you should seriously ask him out."

_You can't answer her because... she's right. You really should._

_This is what you've been waiting for: confirmation._

_Confirmation to trust your feelings and go through with them._

_It's the only reason why you've been avoiding chasing after Charlie; because you needed someone to tell you what you're feeling is right. And you didn't even confess these feelings, Claire knew. If it's that obvious, then it must be true._

"Ugh, don't give me that, 'OMG, what?', expression. God, you're such a bottom." She scoffed, turning her chair to face me. She put her hands on my shoulders and looked me in the eyes. "Okay, listen. Today, when you get home? Do us all a favor, quit beating a dead horse, and ask that bitch out!"

"Claire... I..." I blushed, trying to make sense of what I was feeling. I've never felt this way, ever, about anyone. And now that I have a real chance, I can't comprehend reality.

"No need to thank me, I believe in you," She prodded, booping my nose.

I was utterly dumbfounded by this.

_I'm gonna do it. I'll ask him out._

It was my mindset. It was the only thing I could think about.

All throughout Mixed Media, I couldn't get my mind off it. At lunch, it was still in my head. 11 AM. 12 PM. 1 PM. 2 PM. I couldn't stop. I couldn't pay attention to anything else around me, and this time, it wasn't because I was sad. I was in love.

I met up with Charlie on our way to our Graphic Design class. Sure, I was definitely overcome with fear and nerve when I saw him considering what I was thinking all day, but I couldn't help but swoon. 'What are you smiling about?' He would ask me. 'Oh, nothing,' I would say, thinking about how I would pop the question later afternoon.

Butterflies raged around in my stomach while walking home from my last class. Jesus, I'm like a teenage girl. You should've seen me, blushing, giggling, swooning deeply. This is probably the gayest I've ever been. But, what can I say? The moment of truth was coming.

Little did I know, that once I got back to the house, the worse would come.

\~~~

## Charlie

I don't know how to feel about Sky at the moment. I _really_ want to feel romantically involved with him... but, it's just so new that... I have no idea how to handle it. I've never liked someone of the same gender as much as I do him. But what would that mean for me? For Sky? For my feelings, my emotions, my reputation... my friends?

I've only ever kissed a guy once. It was so unfamiliar that we got so carried away with it... and _almost_ slept with each other. That would've been the biggest mistake of my life.

Doing things without thinking. That's the cause of most mistakes I've made in my life.

I just need to know how Sky feels about it too. If I want this feeling to progress, then, hell, I'm open to it. I just need his permission.

I should ask him on the drive to Amber's. I'm walking back to the apartment, now, so that won't take much time.

Walking up the steps, I heard a clamor coming from inside the building. I thought it was just the boys being themselves, but when I unlocked the door and stepped inside, I realized something was terribly wrong.

I heard shouting upstairs from Byron and Dylan.

"What are you gonna do, faggot?! What are you gonna do?!"

_Shit._

_SHIT!_

I dropped my bags and my keys and ran up the staircase.

"Stop crying, queer!"

_FUCK!_

I looked left, I looked right, I looked down the hall, noticing the sounds were coming from our bedroom. I raced down the hallway, towards the door. Everything felt like it was in slow-motion. I knew what I would find once I opened the door, but for some reason, I kept hoping I was wrong. I wanted to be wrong.

_Please, let me be wrong._

Busting the door wide open, I could see Sky, helpless, on the floor, being kicked and beaten by Byron, who was being cheered on by Dylan, who I thought was a friend.

"Oh, shit!" Dylan gasped, looking at me. Byron stopped to take the sight of me in. "Look who decided to join the party!"

"Get the fuck off of him!" I shouted in rage and fear.

Sky looked up at me. I could see tears pouring from his red, weakened eyes.

"C'mon, Charlie!" Dylan goaded. "I thought you were one of us! Help us kill this asshole."  

I felt frozen, not knowing what to do. I wanted to punch the living daylights out of Byron, but he's taller, stronger, and way scarier than me. I couldn't say anything.

"Told you," Byron chided. "He's a pussy, just like his little boyfriend." After that statement, Byron delivered a violent kick to Sky's stomach.

"AH!" Sky screeched, his head cramming into the floor. Blood leaked from his mouth and stained the carpet.

The sight of Skyler, living his worst nightmare, defenseless, unprotected, terrified for his life, did me in. Gasping for a sliver of air just to breathe, only for Byron to knock his chance away every second. He needed to escape this place. I needed to help him.

I need to help him.

"Stop, Byron!" I commanded, shoving him, but to no avail. He is basically a living cinderblock. "I said, stop!" Going in for a blow to the face.

As my fist flew through the air, Byron's paw rose and snatched my arm from coming any further.

"I don't think you want to do that." He dared, his sharp claws starting to dig into my limb.

"I said, 'stop'." I ordered, my mouth opening to show my teeth; a haunting, low growl emerging from deep within me.

"Oh, fuck, Charlie," Byron laughed in astonishment, knowing what was coming.  

Byron took his other arm and raised it into a fist. I closed my eyes, expecting the worst. I heard it sock me in the head before feeling it.

Actually, I didn't feel it at all. Not at first. Everything just, kind of, went white... and my skull felt like it was suddenly freezing. It was like that for only a few seconds. That's when the numbness rushed in.

I waited for the pain. Every second it didn't come felt like hours. Months. Years. I better savor this moment before it's gone. The anticipation was probably more painful than the actual strike.

Then it hit me. The excruciating, agonizing, terrible pain. My head felt like it was on fire. Byron has a good fucking arm.

But I know how to recover. I've been beaten much harder than this.

Thanks, dad. You finally contributed to my life.

My body picked itself back up and jumped into action. Jabs left and right. Some striking Byron, some striking me. Everything felt real, but not at the same time. Everything felt like nothing. Just a passing blur of rage. Sudden impacts, frequently clashing into my body in all the worst ways.

"Stop!" I could hear Sky yelp.

"Beat his ass, Byron!" Dylan provoked.

I just kept going at him. I wasn't even aware of how much pain I was in. I only had one thing in mind: war.

As I said, I don't think. I just do.

But shockingly, all the years of bad blood between me and my father were suddenly failing me. Byron was starting to get the upper hand. He twisted my arm and put me into a headlock, suffocating me.

"Yeah! Let's go!" Byron crowed, enjoying every moment of beating the shit out of me.

This position gave me an advantage. A strange one, I must say, but definitely helpful. It involved my foot. Can you guess?

_Well, I kicked him where the sun don't shine._

He shrieked, letting me free. I fell to my knees, coughing and sputtering, taking in enough oxygen to finish him off.

I can do this. I can win this fight. I can save Sky.

I was just about ready to turn around and re-enter the warzone once more, until something bad happened.

Three, razor-sharp claws tore into my back.

The point of impact struck my shoulder and stretched all the way across my spine and to my hip.

My back was cut wide open.

Byron scraped me, violently.

_Sorry for the color commentary._

Just like before, the pain didn't settle in just yet, but it did come quicker than expected. My damaged skin ached as if I had been stabbed with a thousand knives. I could feel the warm blood rush down my fur and coat the floor.

_Is now a good time to say, "ow"?_

I fell onto the floor. My face slammed into the ground.

When I first entered this house, I initially believed the carpet was soft and fuzzy. Not anymore.

I screamed, loudly and harrowingly.

"Charlie!" I could hear Skyler cry.

Nothing was more unbearable than the antagonizing strain of the fresh injury cursing my back. I didn't think it could get worse, but somehow, it did.

I felt Byron's large hand grasp the back of my neck. He tugged, picking me up from my throat. He got a tighter hold on it, choking and gagging me. He was literally hanging me with his own paw. I felt like throwing up.

"Stop! Stop, please!" Sky squealed, weeping intensely. "He's had enough!"

Byron slammed me up against the wall, cornering me.

_I can't believe I was letting this fucking demon intimidate me. To befriend me just to violate my trust. He's a homophobic monster. So is Dylan. And I knew it, all throughout high school. Why didn't I fucking do anything about him back then? How many other gay people has he almost killed? Behind my back? Is this a hobby for them? Do they like this?_

Byron unleashed another round of constant, aching blows to my chest and face.

"I said, 'he's had enough'!" Sky screamed repeatedly.

"Alright, what are we gonna do with you?" Dill quipped, picking Sky up vigorously and slamming him into the wall next to me.

"I bet you faggots like this, huh?" Byron gibed, his voice dominating my strength. "Does this turn you on, you wanna fuck us?"

"You wanna kiss me, cock-sucker?" Dill said, closing in on Sky. "Do it. Kiss me." Sky closed his eyes, whimpering in utter fear and dread.

I don't know how much longer I can stand this. I don't know how much longer Sky could stand this. He's weak, weaker than any of us. I've only known him for two months, but I already know how easily he could break. This must be traumatizing for him. I wish I could comfort him, tell him it's gonna be okay.

But I couldn't.

I feel like we're about to die.

They might actually kill us.

They could if they wanted to.

  

"ENOUGH!" A booming voice sounded from behind me.

I didn't see who it was.

"BOTH OF YOU, STOP IT, NOW!"

Whosever voice it was, it was fucking terrifying. It was low, grim, and haunting. It felt like Satan had risen from hell, entered our household, and was demanding order. Apparently, Byron and Dylan felt the same way. Their hands retreated from us, allowing us to breathe again.

I looked to my right and grabbed Sky. He crumbled into my arms like a sheet of wet paper. I held him, longingly.

I opened my eyes fully and examined where the voice came from.

Jonathan stood in the doorway.

"Back up." He appointed. Byron and Dylan stared at him, not knowing whether to follow instructions or deviate.

"FUCKING BACK UP!"

Guess that gave them their answer. They backed up, raising their hands in the air as if they were under arrest.

"Do you two know what you've just done?" Jonathan questioned, standing in front of Byron and Dylan. I carried Sky away into the corner. I felt his tears melt through my shirt and into my chest. "Do you know what this can cost you? This tiny slip up? This tiny fight? You're entire FUCKING scholarships, you pricks!"

I looked down at Sky. He held onto me tightly, breathing heavily and sobbing uncontrollably. I hugged onto him tighter. I didn't care that his arms were touching my wounds. I needed him to feel safe.

"You two need to get your fucking acts together." Jonathan fumed. "Jesus, look at me when I'm talking to you! Dylan, we all know that you and your family cheated and colluded with a faculty member to get you a full-ride. Byron, buddy, you're a fucking weed dealer. I know your spots, all of them. This could ruin you. I could easily expose both of you, do you hear me?"

Byron and Dylan stood there, unresponsive.

"I SAID, DO YOU HEAR ME?!"

"Y-Yes, sir." They both mumbled.

"Now, you leave Charlie and Sky alone for as long as you live, or else I blow the whistle. Got it?" Jonathan demanded.

They both nodded, frightened of who they thought was once a calm, collected lion.

But that lion showed his teeth.

"Get some bleach, towels, and a bucket of water. Clean this shit up." He ordered. "When Charlie, Sky, and I get back, I want this place spotless. Not a single drop of blood."

They nodded once more and left the room in a hurry. Jonathan watched them furiously as they left. Once they were out of sight, Jonathan turned to us. His eyes changed from enraged to concerned.

"Oh my god," He sighed, reaching for us.

I grabbed his arm, finally surrendering into my injured state. Jonathan caught me before I hit the ground. Sky fell to my side, this time, putting his arm around me. Both Jonathan and Sky lifted me up, their arms supporting my back.

"Get him into my car, it's outside by the fire hydrant. Lay him on his stomach. I know a pharmacy near here, so we can fix him up ourselves." Jonathan informed Sky. He nodded worriedly as Jonathan rushed off to find his keys.

Sky tried to support my weight on his own, but struggled harshly. It seemed like he was trying all his might to carry me, but his body was too weak and too frail. Plus, he just got kicked in the stomach several times, too.

"I got it, Sky," I assured, standing up somewhat-normally, but he refused to leave my side. Sky assisted me out of the house and towards Jonathan's car.

Jonathan rushed out of the apartment and pushed the button on the car keys, starting the automobile with a faint beep. Sky opened the door and helped me inside, lying me on my stomach as instructed. Sky touched my head delicately before getting into the passenger's seat. Jonathan took the wheel and swerved into town.

The entire car ride, Sky looked back at me, holding my hand.

# 12. CHARLIE AND SKYLER

\~~~

## Charlie

Once we arrived at the drug store, I could see Claire out front waiting for us, worried sick.

"Don't worry, I called her," Jonathan said as he pulled me out of the car. Sky joined my side once again... I could get used to him being there.

Claire opened the glass doors and welcomed us inside. The pharmacy was vastly empty and loosely stocked. I was immediately taken into the bathroom, out of sight of the paramedic. We didn't want him to know there had been a fight on campus. We could get into all sorts of trouble.

"Alright, Charlie, I'm gonna take care of you," Claire comforted, taking out a piece of paper and writing a list of items on it. "Don't worry, I know how to bandage an open wound." Jonathan looked at her, slightly stunned. "What? I have a lot of skills. I'm basically a Mary Sue."

Sky held my hand tightly as I sat on the toilet seat.

"Can you get me all of these items? Thanks, babe," Claire instructed, handing Jonathan the piece of paper. "Oh, and call Amber's. Tell them there's been an emergency, Sky and Charlie can't come in today." Jonathan nodded and left the bathroom.

"It's gonna hurt, but you have to take off your shirt," Claire informed me, sitting down behind me, staring at my wounded back. I allowed her to remove it carefully. I watched as Sky tried his best to keep eye contact.

"Alright, Sky, help me out," Claire said, giving him a cloth. "Apply pressure to the wound."

"This might hurt a bit," Sky warned. I closed my eyes as he forced the cloth on my back, and, Jesus, did it hurt. The cloth felt hard and ragged, as if it were digging into my skin. I groaned in pain, but Sky tightening his grasp on my paw helped substantially.

After a few minutes had gone by, Jonathan entered the bathroom with the stuff on Claire's list.

"Alright, once the bleeding stops, we're gonna clean, disinfect, then bandage," Claire informed, washing her hands in the sink. "Isn't this fun? We're having so much fun," She said, grabbing a wipe and a cup of water.

Claire went to work on my wounds. The whole time, my eyes were locked on Sky. He just kept telling me sweet nothings, like, 'you're going to be okay' and 'just keep looking at me'. I was surprised by how calm he was, still holding my hand. He hasn't let go of it since the car. He really cares about me.

Him, Claire, Jonathan, they all do. _I can't believe I was actually friends with those dicks. How could I have been so blind as to not see how toxic they were? These are my real friends. Right here, in the room, caring for me._

_Skyler. Jonathan._ _Claire._

_These are my friends._

_My best friends._

\~~~

"Alright, you're all done." Claire sighed after wrapping the bandage around my body. She wiped her brow and collapsed to the floor in relief. Jonathan held her hand, just like Sky did with me. He finally let go of me, knowing I'd be okay without his comfort.

I stood to my feet, wobbling, using the wall to catch myself after not standing up straight for so long. Claire really is skilled in multiple areas, my back didn't feel as painful as it did before.

"You're a miracle worker, Claire," Sky praised, standing up next to me and holding me by my arm.

"Do you want me to take care of those cuts?" She prompted, pointing at Sky's face, rising to her feet.

"A few band-aid's will do fine, thanks," Sky suggested. Claire put her hand on his shoulder and nodded.

Claire and Jonathan left me and Sky alone in the bathroom. I looked at myself in the mirror, seeing a bruise on my forehead. I picked at it, not coming into full contact with it as it hurt whenever I touched it.

"It will go away in a few weeks," Sky assured, rubbing my shoulder and twisting the water faucets of the sink on. "Wash your face." He told me, and I did what he said. Once I finished, Sky took over the sink to clean his. I grabbed a few paper towels out of the dispenser on the side of the room and dried my face with them.

I sat on the toilet seat and stared at the floor, feeling drained and fatigued. Sky lowered to his knees next to me, placing his paws on my arm.

There was so much I wanted to say to him... but I couldn't. I felt so drained that I couldn't even look at him. I just sat there like an empty vessel, a lifeless husk. Sky lowered his head onto my paw, sighing deeply.

I only then noticed that I was wearing almost nothing to cover my torso other than those bandages. Sky noticed that I was looking down at my body. He unzipped his jacket and handed it to me. Reluctantly, I took it. It was a little hard to put on because of how tight it was, but it fit snugly.

Claire returned to the restroom and handed Sky the band-aids and a snack bag. "They're the small circular band-aids, there were no big ones in stock. I also got you two a bag of chips, just in case you wanted anything to eat. From my experience, food is the best cure for pain. And a hangover." Sky rolled his eyes and thanked Claire, opening the box.

"Do you two need anything else? We can all leave together, if you'd like," Claire asked caringly.

"I'm gonna stay with Charlie for a bit," Sky told her, taking a few band-aids out of the container. "Thank you guys so much, this is..."

"Oh, don't sweat it. Get home safely. Text me if you need anything, Charlie." Claire nodded, Jonathan waving to us before closing the door and leaving the premises.

Sky unwrapped the tiny, individual band-aids and placed them on his head, carefully and quietly. When he was done, he sat back down next to me. He held my right arm gently and examined it.

"He got your arm, too," Sky mumbled, taking the wet paper towel and placing it on the cuts where Byron dug his claws into. Sky then proceeded to take more band-aids out and stick them, one by one, on all the marks.  

That was when I felt I could muster the ability to look at Sky. Maybe even talk to him.

"Hey, Sky," I moaned, groggily, my voice raspy and weary.

"Hi, Charlie," Sky smiled sweetly, returning to holding my hand. I loved feeling his tiny hand in my large paw. It makes me feel comfortable and safe, like I really had someone here for me. I squeezed it and caressed it carefully. I rubbed my fingers over the soft, delicate fur, feeling it's grooves and the bone underneath.

"Are you hurt?" I managed to speak, staring at his paw.

"'Am I hurt'?" Sky scoffed.

The serene, honeyed tone of his voice placed me into a trance, convincing me that I was dreaming. Distracted, I looked back up to his face, only to notice he had been crying.

Seeing Skyler in such a depressive state shook me, giving me whole control over my body again. I turned to face him, putting my hands on his shoulders.

"Hey, what's wrong?" I asked, staring longingly into his great, bright pink eyes. Whenever I see them I feel as though I could just fall into them and float in a space of peace and tranquility, no matter what emotion they were portraying.

"I'm sorry, Charlie," He wept, tears streaming down his fur. "I'm sorry I did this to you,"

"You didn't do this to me," I told him.

"Yes, I did," He tried to say through his sobs. "If it wasn't for me, you never would've gotten beaten up... or have lost your friends."

"They weren't my friends," I reassured him, leaning in. "You, Claire, and Jonathan are. You guys are my best friends."

"No, Charlie. I shouldn't be your friend." Sky sniffled.

"Why is that?"

"This whole thing was my fault. All me."

"How is this your fault?"

"Because they heard us. Last night. When Byron and Dylan... hurt me, they told me... that they listened in... to our conversation. If I hadn't had told you‚Äî"

"Sky," I simpered, squeezing him by his sides. "That doesn't make this your fault. They were jerks. End of story."

"But, Charlie‚Äî" Sky whimpered, his paws grasping my arms.

"Come here," I chuckled, joining him on the floor and scooping him up into a warm hug. "There is nothing, _nothing_, in the world that could stop me from being your friend."

"But... but..." Sky stuttered, his head resting on my shoulder.

"What is it?" I asked, rubbing his back. "Do you hate me for saying this?"

"No," He spoke. "I hate myself."

He started to bawl once more, burrowing his face into my neck, hugging me tighter the more he cried.

"Oh, Skyler," I sighed, resting my muzzle over his shoulder and into his back. I wrapped my arms around him, strongly and firmly. Tears fell from my eyes, thinking about Sky, me, us, everything.

We just sat there, rocking back and forth, quietly crying together within an embrace of heartfelt emotion and love. Just us, Charlie and Skyler. Together.

_He fits perfectly within my chest._

_I don't want to let go of him._

_He's, just, so broken... I want to fix him._

_I want to fix him so badly._

_I have to._

"Hey," I called, rubbing his head. "Let's go home, okay?"

Sky nodded listlessly in agreement, yawning as he backed away from my shoulders, leaving his arms to slink over them.

He tried to get up from the floor, until suddenly, Sky eyed me directly. He was giving me a look different than any he's given me before. I eyed him in return, wondering what this was about. His mouth opened frequently at moments, only to close again. He stared at me as if he wanted to say something, but I felt as though he was second-guessing himself on what to say.

"What is it?" I pondered out loud.

"I... I..." He muttered, still looking at me with his bright, pink eyes. "I wanted to ask you something,"

"Okay..?"

"But I don't know if I have the courage to do it."

"Well..." I hesitated. "What's the basis of the question?"

Sky started to breathe heavily, his paws clenching behind me as they hung around my neck.

"I-It's... a-about us," Sky confessed.

_Oh._

From that moment, I knew where this was going.

"I know what you're going to say," I smirked, placing my paws around his torso. This time, he didn't freak out.

"You do?" Sky shivered, shifting awkwardly in my arms.

"Yeah, I do," I grinned, pulling him only slightly closer to me.

"Well... what are you thinking?" He blushed, looking to the floor.

I felt a rush of blood. His muzzle was inches away from mine.

The urge to start kissing him passionately began to take over me, but then I remembered what I warned myself about before.

_Think about what you're about to do before doing it._

"Let's go home, first," I suggested, getting out from underneath him and rising to my feet. "Then I'll tell you my answer." I held my hand out for Sky, pulling him up.

We left the pharmacy in what looked to be the dead of night. We hadn't noticed how much time had passed until we exited the shop. The walk home was quick but chilly. It only looked dark because time was moving quickly towards winter, and the sun would set at about 6 o'clock. How come I have only just noticed that it's October up until now? My favorite month?

Sky shivered in the wind. He had given me his jacket willingly, knowing how cold it would be, but he wanted me to have it anyway since I didn't have a shirt. It was pretty small on me, I hope I didn't stretch out the material. I wrapped my arm around him to warm him up, Sky nesting his head into my chest. We stayed like this the entire walk home, no words, no looks or glances, just like this. But oddly, we were fine with it. It was the only silence between us that wasn't awkward.

Because something else was occurring between us. Something new.

We got to the apartment. It seemed as though everyone was asleep in the house. We snuck in through the front door and crept up the stairs. We tiptoed down the hallway and into our bedroom.

Byron and Dylan really did clean up, the room was well-beyond spotless.

Sky turned on the LED lights above his bed for the first time in a while. It felt as though he was saving it for a special occasion. They gave off a rather... romantic vibe to the bedroom.

I closed the door behind us.

I locked it.

I turned around and faced Skyler.

He faced me.

There we were, staring at each other from across the room. We may have been separated by a few feet, but our souls... were connected.

Seeing him there, all of him, in all his glory, I never noticed how... beautiful he is.

A blue cat with pink stripes. A gorgeous blend of colors and patterns.

His face. His ears, his eyes, his nose, his mouth. His smile.

He's adorable.

Everything about him is... adorable.

The way he dresses, he's stylish. He's colorful. I now just noticed his mismatched socks. He may be messy at times but he can somehow pull it off flawlessly.

He's a variety of things.

Beauty. Personality. Charm. Talent. Heart.

The way he looks at me, honest and genuine. The way he holds his hands behind him. The way he sways back and forth from his toes to his heel. It was calling for me. His everything, his image, his entire package, it's calling for me.

I wanted him.

I can't believe I said that... but I really did.

I wanted him, here, now, at this moment.

Every glance he gave me activated me. If I hadn't had control over my body, I'd surely be drooling all over him.

He's a feline, the so-called 'sworn enemy' to us canines.

But I don't mind it.

Why?

_Because, Skyler Clawfield, you are a masterpiece._

And now it's just us.

Charlie and Skyler.

"You want my answer?" I whispered to him.

He nodded.

"Yes, Sky," I stated. "Of course."

He swooned, biting his lip and blushing deeply.

He smiled.

That smile sealed the deal. That it was okay.

I took a step towards him.

He did the same.

Our steps mirrored each other until we were face to face.

"Skyler," I whispered.

"Charlie," He purred.

This was the moment.

The moment we have both been waiting for.

It was perfect, the setting, the mood, the two of us...

It was perfect.

I wrapped my arms around Sky. He placed his paws on my chest.

I closed my eyes.

I leaned in.

  

_But Sky pulled away._

I opened my eyes, wondering if I had somehow missed his mouth. But, no. He pulled away.

"I-I'm sorry, was that the wrong move?" I stammered, startled by his action.

_Did I mess up? Was the question he was gonna ask something else? Oh, god, what have I done?_

"No, no, it's not your fault," Sky moaned, parting from me. He rubbed his temples in frustration.

_But what was he frustrated about?_

"You sure?" I asked. I must've looked seriously frightened, considering how scared I felt, for both me and Sky. He looked at me with sorrowful, apologetic eyes.

"Yeah, yeah," Sky stumbled, sitting on his bedside. "I just... I... I don't know what I'm doing. What we're doing. I've never been in a relationship. I've never kissed a guy. I've never kissed anyone, really." He confessed.

"You've never kissed... anyone?" I perplexed. I was surprised. I mean, who wouldn't want to kiss him? "Are you, like, worried you're a bad kisser or something?" I said, attempting to lighten the tense atmosphere. I joined him on the bed, my paw touching and grazing his knee.

"No, no, definitely not, well kinda, but not mainly, I... I-I've never done this before, Charlie." He whined. "Look, I like you. I really, really like you, Charlie. You're the nicest guy I've ever met. I, just, I-I don't know what I'm doing, and I don't want to disappoint you, I'm, just, I-I'm really panicking right now, can you just tell me‚Äî"

I placed my finger over his lips, shushing him.

Once he was fully quiet, I took my finger away and stared at him, my eyes full of desire.

"Just follow my lead," I whispered into his ear. "You'll be okay, I promise."

Sky nodded, closing his eyes and breathing deeply.

He was ready.

I placed my paw underneath his chin, caressing his fur, preparing myself.

I leaned in towards him, growing closer and closer every second.

This is it.

  

My mouth landed on his.

We shared a short, sweet, sensual kiss.

An exasperating sensation ran through me, loving every second of it. His lips were light and silky to the touch and he tasted like cotton candy. This kiss dominated me. The feeling was so exotic and refreshing that I felt as though I had been a closeted homosexual all my life. This was way different than making out with a female, and it was a lot more engaging.

Our foreheads touched as our muzzles separated, breaking off our first ever kiss.

By the way Sky was breathing, I could tell he really enjoyed it. He wanted more. So did I.

I slithered closer to him on the bed, my paws clenching onto his hips. I leaned in, our lips fusing together a second time. This one was longer, more passionate and romantic.

Once we both pulled away and opened our eyes to each other, we both knew where this was headed.

I grabbed his waist, pulling him in, closer than we've ever been before. So close that we could hear each other's rapid heartbeats.

We both went in for a third. This one was different. It was lustful and amorous. My tongue slipped through my lips and broke into his. I explored his mouth, loving the way he tasted. He was creamy and velvety on the inside. Sky started to laugh as I kissed him. He was probably ticklish, and this feeling was a little too erotic for him to handle.

I broke it off, dragging Sky down into the bed. He was light and not too heavy to pull. I climbed over him swiftly and continued the kiss. We made out intensely, my nails digging into his shoulders, our shortage of breath generating sexual energy, transmitting through our lips. I was taken over by lust.

I moved my mouth to his neck. My heart fluttered as my mind explored all the ways we could love each other... all the things we could get away with tonight. I could hear Sky moaning softly and breathlessly right next to my ear, and, _holy fuck,_ did that turn me on.

I kissed his neck even faster now, tugging the collar of his shirt down so I could feel his chest. His fur was so welcoming and delicious, I didn't even hear Sky calling my name.

The lower I went, the more I fell under the spell of Sky's presence. My paw reached towards the button of his jeans, ready to rip them off clean.

That was when I heard Sky.

"Charlie!" He called for me.

"Y-Yeah? Yeah?" I responded, picking my head up immediately.

"C-Can we stop?" He asked, grabbing the button of his jeans.

_Sure, I was a little disappointed, but I didn't want to force Sky to do anything he didn't want to do._

"Oh, yeah, sure. We can totally stop." I confirmed, sitting back up.

"I'm sorry," Sky apologized, curling up next to the bedframe.

"Hey, don't be. Don't be," I reassured, resting my hand on his foot, fiddling with his toes. "Are you okay?"

"Um... Uh... I..." Sky sputtered, pulling his shirt over his legs down to his toes, shifting awkwardly.

"Did I do something wrong?" I wondered, worriedly.

"No, I... Uh... I'm sorry..."

"Stop saying that. You're shivering, are you sure‚Äî"

"I'm fine, I swear." Sky dismissed, scooting back a little bit.

"You're moving away from me."

"I'm sorry..."

"Hey, Sky..."

"I'm sorry, I just... I don't know..."

"Sky, Sky!"

"I don't know what I'm... I'm sorry..."

"Hey, hey, hey! Stop panicking!" I comforted, sitting to the left of him in the bed. "I get it, we were moving way too fast. Way too fast for you."

"This is... just... so new to me." Sky admitted. "I've never felt this way about anyone... ever. You were my first real crush, my first kiss... I'm not sure how to feel, what to do, what to say, how this will affect us and our friendship‚Äî"

I leaned in and hugged him lovingly, smothering his entire build in one tight grip.

"I know, and I'm sorry I put you in this position," I whispered softly into his ear.

"I'm not saying I don't like it... I do... I really do..." Sky whispered in response. "I like what we're feeling, right now, this very moment, but I don't know where it'll go. I still haven't figured things out, yet. My sexuality... my feelings for guys... my feelings for you... I don't know what I'm okay with and what I'm not okay with..."

"How about we find out together?" I proposed, separating us from the hug. "It's just us. We'll take this at your pace, alright?"

Sky looked at me, blushing honestly and profoundly. We're genuine and authentic with each other. Our relationship is real, and it always will be. Skyler just needs time to come out of his shell. I get it, he doesn't want to have sex just yet. I'm happy to wait, I'm in no rush. Actually, it'd be fun to be the one who helps this poor kitten. I could show him so many new things... The possibilities are endless.

"Alright." Sky compromised.

"Alright!" I beamed, leaning back in for another peck. Luckily, I got it. Sky kissed me back, willingly,

"I'm gonna have to get used to this," Sky laughed as we made out even more.

I laid him down into the bed and collapsed right next to him. I pulled his blanket over us, making sure we were both submerged in its warmth. Sky settled in, shifting and snuggling under the covers.

"Is this okay, sweetheart?" I smirked, chuckling.

"Shut up," Sky mumbled from underneath the sheets.

I began to remove Sky's sweater, exposing my bare, bandaged torso, before Skyler said, "Can you keep your clothes on?"

In response, I fixed it back into place and put the hoodie over my head. I grabbed the strings and tugged on them, tightening the hoodie so that it covered my ears, eyes, and the sides of my face, closing up on my muzzle. It was my attempt at making Skyler laugh. "Good?" I asked, providing a sense of comic relief. Sky giggled and blushed.

I took the hoodie off and sat up, flicking the light switch for the LEDs off, immersing us into the calm darkness of the room.

I laid down in his bed, still bewildered by how much comfier it was than mine. I put my right arm around Sky. He was so small and light compared to me, I could literally carry him in a teacup. I could sense his heart beating rapidly. He's just so fucking adorable. Once I wrapped him up, he rested his head on my chest and held my remaining left paw.

"If I move around a lot, I'm sorry, I'm... just... really awkward in bed." He added.

"Do you want me to get your headphones?"

"I can go one night without them." He flirted.

I looked up to the ceiling, admiring the tranquil blackness of the quiet night. Sky was in my arms, and that was all that mattered.

"What if we regret this?" I heard him whisper.

He's right. What if we do?

I don't think it matters. It's important that we got here anyway. That we got to this point in our friendship.

"We'll figure it out in the morning," I answered, allowing Sky to relieve himself of his doubts. "Good night, adorable," I spoke softly.

I heard no response.

Sky was already fast asleep in my chest.

  

_Tonight was good. Tonight was great._

_I guess I have a... boyfriend... now?_

_This is insane._

_Who knows where this could lead?_

_Who knows what crazy story this could become?_

_I'm willing to take the risk, all for Sky._

_Just me and Skyler._

_Charlie and Skyler._

# 13. PEACE TREATY

### ACT II**:** MORE THAN FRIENDS

\~~~

## Charlie

My eyes cracked open to the sight of blinding light. I closed my eyes instinctively, hiding my face away from the sun shining through the exposed windows.

I blinked a few times before adjusting my eyes to my surroundings. I saw cracks in the ceiling above me.

I just realized where I was.

My head darted to my right in a flash to see Sky, conked out in the same place he laid last night. He was sleeping soundly, his head nuzzled deep into my chest.

I wanted to get a better view of him. I, delicately and gently, lifted his head and removed my arm from underneath him, laying him back down onto the pillow. I rested on my side, my head on the same pillow, watching him sleep from a different angle.

_Lord, have mercy, Sky. You're a small, tender bean bag._

He looked so peaceful at rest that I didn't want to wake him. I wish I could just freeze time and keep him here forever. I could see his chest rise and fall gracefully as he breathed‚Äî_inhale, exhale,_‚Äîfaintly and elegantly. I could see his breath, coming from his nostrils, flow and brush through his soft, fuzzy, pastel fur. I could see him. Just him. Everything about him, in full. This is who he really is when he's not shy or scared. I was getting an inside-look behind Skyler Clawfield's curtain.

I listened closely, hearing a soft purr coming from him. It sounded so rhythmic and soothing, like... white noise. I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure when cats purr, they're happy or pleased. He's happy, here with me.

I couldn't resist touching him. My paw rose to his face and started to caress his sensitive cheek, cautious as not to wake him, but to please him so he could nap a little longer. I wanted this moment for as long as I could get it.

But the moment ended.

Sky flinched, reacting to my touch. He began to yawn tactfully, not opening his eyes just yet. He rested his head back into the fluffy pillow, his eyelids opening sliver by sliver.

Once they were fully open, he stared at my chest. I don't think he realized I was right in front of him.

I laughed in my head, waiting for him to notice me.

When he did, his eyes widened.

"Hey," I whispered.  
  
  

He screamed like a banshee, backed up hastily, and fell out of the bed, collapsing onto the floor in a noisy tumble.

I got up immediately, peering concerningly over the corner of the mattress to see Sky on the floor, shocked and confused. I sighed, laughing at how helpless this kitten is.

"Shut up!" Sky whined, rubbing his forehead.

"Sky, you're so adorable." I gushed, getting out from under the covers and dangling my feet over the bedside.

"I told you to stop calling me that," Sky grunted, picking himself up by his arms and sitting next to the wall.

"I'm being honest, aren't I?" I jested, lowering myself to the floor and sitting next to him.

"What happened last night?" Sky yawned, rubbing his eyes.

"We made out and had sex," I joked, passing him a footsie.

"What?!" Sky gasped, looking up from his paws. He seemed seriously frightened.

"I-I'm joking, Sky," I told him, wondering why he got so defensive.

"Oh, thank god," He sighed, dropping his head into his arms, curling up into a ball.

"What, you don't want to have sex with me?" I chuckled, nudging him in the leg.

"No, I... Can we not use that word?" He proposed.

"Why, you scared of it?" I teased, grabbing him and pulling him towards me.

"N-No, I'm not," He defended as I laid him on his back into my lap.

"Well, what other words would you like me to use?" I scoffed, cradling him.

"I dunno, just not _that_ word."

"Okay, so, you don't wanna fuck me?"

"Alright, I'm done," Sky ditched, getting up from my embrace and onto his feet, walking towards the bedroom door to leave.

"I'm kidding, Sky!" I giggled, sneaking up behind him and picking him up from his waist.

"Ah! Quit it, Charlie!" He moaned as I swirled him around in circles.

"You're so fucking light, Jesus!" I humiliated as I carried him around the room.

Suddenly, our door opened and Jonathan dropped in. He stared at us, puzzled. Me and Sky paused as he caught us, looking at him, abashed.

"Uh... I heard someone fall, is everyone okay in here?" He asked, pushing our positions aside.

"S-Sky did," I blurted, Sky fussing with me to be let go of. "But, he's alright, now," I added as I placed him down on his feet.

"Alright, lovebirds," Jonathan smirked, closing the door behind him.

Sky brushed himself off and patted his fur down swiftly. I looked at him and ruffled my paw through his hair, jokingly undoing his hard work. Sky stared at me icily, exiting the room into the bathroom.

\~~~

I went downstairs to the kitchen after taking a shower and getting dressed for the day. Dylan and Byron were talking in a corner and Sky was fiddling with something by the counter.

"Whatcha doin'?" I intruded, mimicking Isabella Garcia Shapiro.

"Making breakfast," Sky replied, scraping butter on a crisp piece of toast. "Here, eat." He said, holding the toast up to my face. I opened my muzzle and Sky stuffed it inside my mouth.

"Thank you," I said through mumbles since my jaw was muffled with bread.

I took it out of my mouth, munching on the bit I chewed off. Looking to my right, I could see Dylan and Byron glaring at us. I gulped the food down faster than I expected.

I approached them slowly and awkwardly, hoping there's a chance we could all make amends.

"Hey, guys," I squeaked, fidgeting with my hands. They both just stared at me, crossing their arms like club bouncers. "I-I was just h-hoping... that we could... be open to... putting... the past behind us... S-so, let's forget yesterday ever happened, alright?"

No response. Just intense staring. I stood there, not knowing what to do. I turned my head back at Sky who stood from a distance, fearful as something bad may occur. They were like ticking time bombs. Hopefully, I don't crack under pressure and cut the wrong wires.

"Oooookay..." I shivered, starting to shuffle away.

"You're lucky Jonathan was there," Byron grumbled. "If he never came to your rescue, you would've been six feet in the ground."

I stopped in my tracks, glancing back at them.

"Then... that's twenty years in prison for you." I remarked, glancing at Sky just to see him rolling his eyes. "Oh, and, by the way, Byron? What makes you think you can humiliate and abuse a person just because they have standards you can't live up to?"

Byron tried to deflect my question, but I interrupted him.

"The only person you should be scolding for their behavior is yourself. And Dylan? I thought you were my friend. Guess I was only there for decoration. Let me tell you, no amount of friendly layers can outweigh both of your disgusting habits. You know, people like you strive to get into colleges like this. They work their ass off to get the tiniest bit of credibility that could, you know, ease their hope of the possibility of getting accepted. Some of them, they need a school like this to get somewhere, anywhere in life. Some of them need to get away from home, where they could remain in a hopeless place for the rest of their lives. Imagine how'd they feel when they find out that their positions were given away to you two? Imagine how destroying that would be to their life and their health and their personality. You need to think your life over and somehow make a change. Both of you. Before it's too late."

I turned on them, walking out of the kitchen. Sky followed behind. I didn't need to see their reaction. Their silence was enough.

"Hey, can I walk you to your first class?" I asked Sky as we climbed down the front steps of the house. It was only slightly cold outside but I could hear his teeth chatter.

"Won't you be late for yours?" Sky worried, touching my shoulder.

"Oh, I'm in no rush," I assured him, going the opposite way I used to go whenever we'd separate in the morning. "I also love being outside in Fall."

"Yeah?"

"I mean, October is literally the best month of all."

"You think so?"

"Totally, what's not to love? Halloween, trick or treating, scary movies... Pumpkin-flavored everything, pie, donuts, coffee... The beautiful fall leaves blanketing the ground, basically begging you to jump in..." I swooned.

"I'm more for December, but you make a compelling argument. Animals in high school always said I was too young for trick or treating, though."

"Pfft, screw them. Numbers go up to infinity, so everyone is young. Oh, and not to mention, perfect weather: not freezing cold, not burning hot, just right!"

"I wish I could experience that with you." Sky whined, shivering.

"Well, there'll be a lot of snuggling to make up for that." I chuckled, nudging Sky in the shoulder.

He didn't respond. I started to regret making that joke. I still don't know what he's into or where we are, relationship-wise.

I still don't know if we're even boyfriend and boyfriend.

"Are we... dating now?" I questioned.

"Shh!" Sky hissed, slapping me softly in the arm. "Don't say it in public."

"There's... almost no one on the block." I examined, viewing my surroundings.

"Just... don't say it out loud, please. You know how I get." He whispered to me.

"Alright," I whispered back. "Are we dating, Sky?" Sky gave me the impression that he was conflicted, worrying me a little bit. "If we aren't, that's okay, I just needed clarification." I lied.

"Charlie... I... You know I've never dated anyone before." I nodded, hoping this would end positively. I really like him. I've never dated a guy before, so I thought it might be interesting... or fun. "I've always tried my best to avoid the dating game... I knew nothing good would ever come out of it."

"What do you mean?"

"Dating scares me, Charlie." Sky whimpered, looking at the ground. "It's unknown territory for me, having to be someone's 'special other'. It's like a prison... disguised as a dream. It's like you're forced to show affection or care towards your boyfriend/girlfriend or else you're in an unhealthy relationship."

"It sounds like you're mostly afraid of commitment."

"I am." Sky looked at me. "I don't want to give myself away like that, condemning me to a relationship I don't understand. I wish dating could just be like normal friendships... a close relationship that respects boundaries."

"Well... why can't we be that?"

"I don't know what to expect. I don't even know what it means to be someone's boyfriend. I was never... really... into it."

"Well, are you into this?" I asked him.

"Y-Yeah, I think I like it..." Sky speculated, shrugging.

"Then we should date! It can be a learning experience, for both you _and_ me."

"I... I haven't thought it through enough yet..."

"Well, what's your main concern?" I asked, stopping him and holding him by his shoulders.

"Well... It's a struggle, Charlie."

"A struggle?"

"There's so much you go through in dating. Like, agreements and guidelines... Things such as long-distance-relationships never work, so you always have to be around your partner, and that's not always a good thing. There are breakups and fights and..." Sky sighed, slinking his head down and studying his shoes. "There's just... so much. So much I don't think I can handle."

I let go of his arms, dropping mine to my sides. We both stood there silently, not knowing what to say. Sky peered up at me with eyes full of remorse.

"If... I date anyone... I'd want it to be a simple relationship. Nothing serious." He compromised.

"When... you told me not to say the s‚Äî" I stuttered. "The s-e-x word... were you joking or were you being serious?"

"I was serious."

"You... really don't want to have sex? With me?"

"Charlie, lower your voice!"

"I'm sorry, I'm just asking!"

"No, I don't. Not only with you, with anyone."

"Seriously?"

"Yes, Charlie. I never want to lose my virginity. Never."

"Why not?"

"I..." Sky faltered. "I... I..."

I felt bad for interrogating Sky like this. It was obvious to me that he wasn't comfortable with the topic of discussion, so I don't know why I kept pushing him to answer.

"What are your thoughts on marriage?" I said, changing the subject.

"Hell no."

"Are you kidding me?"

"That's way too much commitment, Charlie. I can't."

I stared in his direction, a little disappointed in him. Sky could pick that up, looking down in shame.

"Charlie..." He spoke. "I'm not careless or apathetic, if that's what you're thinking. The truth is, I'm a coward."

"Sky," I tried to reason.

"No, listen to me." He interrupted. "I'm scared... to love someone. I'm scared... to have... a bond with... another... living being. One that is unlike any other. I won't know how to act. I'm afraid I'll grow so attached to you... that if something goes wrong, I'll blow it out of proportion. We've only known each other for three months. If we start dating now, we'd be going into this blind and ignorant. I don't want us to break up one day and have a complicated relationship for the rest of our lives. I don't want to ruin what we have. What we've worked hard to create."

I understand him. I really do. When I first dated this girl in middle school, we were being idiots. It was toxic and manipulative. She hated me, only using me for attention.

"I get it, Sky," I sympathized, bending down to his level. "Relationships are scary. I would know, I've been in multiple, each different than the last. But, in the entirety of my dating history, I've felt more things with you than anyone else. New things. Exciting things. And that's all in the first three months of us even _knowing_ each other. I don't want to give this chance up. I believe in us, I really do."

Sky gazed back into my eyes, taking a deep breath.

"Be my boyfriend, Sky. Please." I asked him, confidently.

He closed his eyes, releasing a sigh of acceptance. He started to giggle, opening his eyes back up and smiling.

"Alright." He stated.

"Yes!" I cheered, jumping up and down energetically.

"But only under one condition: we set some ground rules." He added, putting his hands on me to settle me down.

"Aw, come on," I whined, jabbing him in his shoulder.

"Charlie!" He snapped, grabbing my hands.

"Alright, alright, fine." I surrendered.

"Okay, rule number one," Sky began.

"Ugh, rules?"

"Are you gonna stop talking?"

"What is this, a fucking peace treaty?

"A-are you gonna‚Äî"  

"'We the furries of the United States of America‚Äî'"

"Charlie, I will not date you if you keep doing this."

"Jesus, I'm sorry! You may continue, your honor." I smirked.

Sky glared at me, notably attempting to contain his anger with me.

"Rule number one," He resumed. "Nothing... sensual." I rolled my eyes, amazed by his incapability to say 'sex'. "No s‚Äîthat. None of that. Nothing over the top, okay?"

"Boo, you're no fun." I scoffed.  

"Charlie."

"I'm already bored of this relationship and it hasn't even started yet‚Äî"

"Rule number two," Sky interrupted. "No 'I love you' or 'you're adorable' kind of stuff. Got that?"

"Nooooo!" I cried. "The sex thing was tolerable but no 'adorable'? It's my best and only word to describe you, you can't do this to me!"

"Will you shut your mouth!" He hissed again, his eyes darting around.

"There's literally NO ONE HERE!" I shouted loudly into the vast emptiness of the neighborhood.

"CHARLIE! Shut up!!" He seethed with fright and rage.

"Hey, calm down, calm down!" I laughed, wrapping his skitterish body in my arms, holding him longingly.

"Rule three!" He grunted, pushing me away. "We act normally. Just like we were before. Just like friends."

I whimpered, hitting him with my best puppy-eyed look, with my lip pouting and my fingers fiddling. I even flopped my ears downward and made my tail sink. "Pwease?" I squeaked softly, causing Sky to smile though he resisted it.

"Fine, at least in public." He added to the peace treaty, rolling his eyes and crossing his arms.

"Mm!" I grunted with success, clenching my fists.

"And most importantly, rule number four. This isn't a serious relationship. We both go into this knowing we aren't in it for the long haul, it's just a time of learning for both of us. Like a test run. Nothing real. Got it?"

"Got it." I replied instantaneously.

"Do you promise to adhere by these rules?" Skyler chuckled, holding out his paw.

"I promise, sir, yes, sir," I stated, clapping my hand into his. We shook on it.

"Good." Skyler sighed. "Guess we're boyfriends now."

"Yesssss!" I celebrated, scooping him up and squeezing him tightly. "Thank you, thank you, thank you‚Äî"

"Charlie, you're suffocating me!" He wheezed.

"Oop. Sorry." I apologized, putting him back down on the ground. I leaned in and kissed him on the lips. He sighed, letting me make out with him. "Mwah." I mocked, breaking the kiss off.

"That was the last time you kiss me in public, so you better savor it, mister." He warned, returning to the path on the way to his first class. I completely forgot about school.

"Can I call you 'babe'?" I gushed, skipping alongside him.

"God, please no."

"Then what can I call you?" I moaned.

Sky dropped his head back and scowled, tired of my complaining.

"You can call me adorable‚Äî"

"Yay!" I beamed.

"‚ÄîOnce per day."

"Fuck."

# 14. THE BREAKFAST CLUB

\~~~

## Skyler

I waved goodbye to Charlie as I entered the lecture hall, leaving him in the hallway.

It's official. I'm in a relationship.

I don't know...

_Yeah, that's it._

_I don't know. That's the only way I can explain it._

_I'm not sure, I'm not ready, I'm not brave._

_I'm Skyler Clawfield, the biggest mishap of our generation. He's Charlie Cooperton, the sweetest, most charming being on this planet. How did we end up together? I have no idea._

_It's probably not gonna last long, maybe a day or two. That's my wager. He'll grow annoyed with me and how much I sulk in loneliness and depression, my incapacity to perform, and my dumb mood swings._

I feel so stressed right now.

Sitting down in my usual seat in the lecture hall, I took out my sketching tablet and started to doodle. Whenever I'm nervous or overcome with anxiety, I draw on my tablet. It distracts me, calms me down, and relaxes me when I'm in tough situations.

"Whatcha up to on your iPad?" I heard a familiar voice ask when she sat next to me.

"Technically, it's called a Surface Pro 7, but I call it a sketching tablet for short," I told Claire, in the middle of drawing a tombstone with the name 'Mrs. Goodwin' engraved in it.

"Oh, shit, Sky. That's over the top," Claire chuckled, looking over my shoulder. "Write, 'she would've lived if it weren't for those meddling kids and their excessive need for Instagram likes and nudes.'" She added, taking her notebook out of her backpack.

"Good lord, I'm actually starting to relate to her," I moaned while writing Claire's suggestion down.

"Here, I made you something," She said, handing me a warm plastic container of food. I would have known which food if it weren't for the steam fogging up the inside. "It's just a little something to apologize for last night."

"You didn't do anything wrong," I wondered. "By all means, I should be apologizing."

"Well, Jonathan wanted to say sorry, you know, for his friends' behaviors, but he didn't know how, so he panicked and called me,"

"Tell him, 'apology accepted'," I grinned, taking the container from her hands. I know what it's like to be socially awkward, trust me.

"It's lasagna, by the way," She informed me.

"Let me guess, you don't know what cats eat so you took advice from Garfield."

"I'm so sorry," She cringed, guiltily.

"It's okay," I laughed. "Luckily for you, I do like lasagna."

"You can keep it in your bag and heat it up later, you probably can't eat it here." She suggested. I nodded, stuffing the container in my bag like she said.  

"I'll probably share it with Charlie, my stomach is way too small to devour that whole thing,"

"Speaking of Charlie," Claire bubbled, tapping my shoulder daintily.

"Oh, god, here we go," I groaned, turning to face her.

"What happened last night? Did you ask him out? Did he say yes? Did you guys kiss? Are you dating now‚Äî"

"God, Claire!" I blushed, holding her by her shoulders. "One question at a time, please!"

Claire took a deep breath, closing her eyes.

"Are you guys dating?" Claire asked slowly.

I looked down at the floor, excitedly swooning, sending Claire an obvious message.

"Shut up," She gasped, her mouth gaping open. I pushed my fur back and nodded quietly, blushing deeply and smiling uncontrollably. "I KNEW IT!" She squealed, jumping onto her feet, causing everyone in the room to look at us.

"Oh, my god! Claire, shush!" I sneered, keeping my voice down.

"Ms. Harper!" The teacher called, Claire sitting down immediately.

"Sorry, ma'am," She apologized, trying not to burst.

"These damn kids, gonna be the death of me," Mrs. Goodwin muttered to herself.

Claire looked at me, wheezing with silenced laughter. I covered my face with my paws, hiding both my embarrassment and my laughter.

"God, both you and Charlie can't keep your mouths closed," I whispered. "He should be your boyfriend, not mine,"

"Okay, first of all, I ain't no slut," She chuckled. "And, second of all, I would never take him away from you! You guys are perfect together."

"How can you be so sure?" I muttered, going back to my drawing.

"Because I'm the best fucking matchmaker to ever exist. That was my nickname in high school, it was what I was famous for. I set so many people up, you have no idea how many condoms I had to purchase..." She exulted before noticing my silence. "Why? Are you having doubts?" She wondered, suddenly growing concerned.

"I don't know how to feel about it," I confessed.

"It's dating, how hard could it be?"

"I've never dated anyone before‚Äî"

"You've never dated before?!" Claire gasped, in complete and utter shock.

"Jesus, Claire, volume!" I hissed.

"I'm sorry, but how is it possible that Sky Clawfield, the most beautiful, talented, ingenious queen that I know, has never once dropped into the dating game at any point in his life?" She sputtered, bewildered.

"Well, I wasn't exactly 'popular' in school."

"Wait... Don't tell me‚Äî"

"I was lonely, Claire," I murmured. "I was a shy, awkward loser throughout my entire life. No one wanted to be my friend."

"Oh, Sky. How am I just hearing about this?" She whined, holding my hands in distress.

"It just... never came up."

"Does Charlie know about it?"

"Yup." I sighed, dropping my head down in annoyance. He knows everything about me.

_Well, not everything._

"Damn, he knows more about you than me and I call you my bestie." She whispered to herself. "B-But, another great reason as to why you guys have a compatible relationship! He understands your troubles and he... supports you? I think?"

"Yeah, he supports me," I scoffed, trying not to smile. I guess he does try his best to comfort and help me...

"See? He's caring! He doesn't mind if you're shy, scared, or unsure about dating, all he cares about is: he likes you. He really does. That's his mindset and he's sticking to it. He's the perfect boyfriend for you, Sky! Don't pass this chance up, enjoy it!"

I looked at her, considering her statement.

_I mean, she's... kinda right._

_What am I saying? She is right. Jesus, she's always right._

Throughout the entire history of us knowing each other, he's always caring about me. Wondering if I'm okay or comfortable. He always thinks about others and never about himself. Never. He's selfless. I can't believe I'm now just realizing this.

He really could be the perfect boyfriend for me.

"You're... sure?" I questioned once more, attempting to confirm my answer.

"Confident." She convinced, crossing her arms and lifting her eyebrows. "He's sweet, funny, helpful, smart, talented, not to mention handsome‚ÄîShit, I think _I'm_ into him, now."

"Oh, back off, honey." I scowled jokingly.

"Alright, Sky!" She marveled, snapping her fingers.

I blushed again, my mind occupied with the thought of Charlie. I was always so haunted by the idea that I would be a terrible partner that I never really stopped to think about how he felt.

I was being selfish.

He likes me. He _wants_ to be my boyfriend. It's not like he has a choice, he's _willing_ to take me on. It may be a challenge, but there are no winners or losers. It's just us, me and Charlie, jumping into this head-first. Together.

He can really help me, coax me out of my shell, bring me into the real world. He already somehow managed to get me to agree with dating him, so that's a plus.

_He really is the perfect boyfriend._

I shouldn't be worrying if I'll mess things up. I should just go with it. Enjoy it while it lasts.

Enjoy him.

Charlie Cooperton, my first ever boyfriend.

\~~~

At 11, Charlie and Jonathan wanted to get lunch with us again. This time, we decided to go to Amber's for food. At first, a coffee shop may sound like it wouldn't serve lunch options on the menu, but it actually houses an array of sandwiches and baked goods.

When the guys met up with us at Amber's, Claire joined Jonathan and went inside, leaving me and Charlie outside. She probably did that on purpose.

"Hey, adorable," He grinned, standing in front of me with his hands in his pockets.

"You already said it once today, you can't say it again." I joked, crossing my arms.

"I'd thought you'd forget." He sighed.

"You lost your privilege for tomorrow. You'll have to wait 'til Sunday to say it again."

"Totally worth it." He said, pinching my cheek.

I wish I could tell him that _he's_ adorable, but I'd be going against my own advice. I guess I'll have to tell him physically. I came closer to him, wrapping my paws under his arms and around his body, hugging him firmly.

"What's this for?" He asked, looking down at me.

"We're dating, aren't we?" My muffled voice spoke as I stuffed my head into his chest. I picked my head up, ascended to my toes, and gave him a quick peck on his muzzle.

"Woah," He admired, staring into the distance. "That's the first time _you_ ever kissed me. In public."

"And it's the last time, too," I said, patting his cheek and opening the door to the cafe.

Eating at Amber's was actually pretty fun. It was weird for me and Charlie to be there normally and not for work, which gave us a glimpse into what it's like to be a customer; and let me tell you, it was a whole new world. We sat on the couch and relaxed from a stressful day of school work. Claire, Jonathan, and I got sandwiches while Charlie ordered a donut and a hot chocolate. Not much of a lunch, but it seemed to fill him up. He sure does have a sweet tooth.

We spent our lunch break laughing and joking with each other. I loved it when the four of us hung out together, we all had an inseparable bond. We were like... the four amigos. An odd squad. The characters from the 'Friends' sitcom. The...

"Guys, we're literally the Breakfast Club!" Claire blurted in excitement. "I'm Claire, obviously, babe, you're Andrew, the athlete." She said to Jonathan. "Sky, you're Allison, the basket case, and Charlie... Hmm... Brian, the brain, maybe?"

"Now we only need a criminal," Charlie jested.

I guess he's seen the movie. I've never watched it, but I hope Allison is a good character.

"Oh, and Amber's is like our detention! Guys, we should go here for lunch every day now! Like a hangout spot!"

She was giggling energetically. I guess she got really excited about her idea. I looked at Charlie, knowing it was originally his idea first, but we all eventually agreed to it just to make Claire happy.

"I have an idea for our first Breakfast Club meeting," Claire beamed as she took out her notebook. "We should all write a letter to ourselves in the future! We can read them again once we finish our first year of college!"

"Why?" I asked.

"C'mon, it'll be fun!" She encouraged, ripping out four slips of paper. "Pour your feelings into them. Ask future-you questions, stuff you're interested in. Tell them things you hope to accomplish by the end of the second semester, and when future-us read them, we can look back to this day and recall our memories from the past!"

"You sound like a middle school teacher." Jonathan laughed, kissing her cheek.

She gave us the pieces of paper and we all got to work. It took me a few seconds to think about what to write before starting, but I think mine was pretty interesting. I wanted to read what Charlie wrote, but he said it should be a secret until we opened them back up again. Once we all finished our letters, Claire took the papers, folded them, and put them in a shoebox that she somehow had at the moment.

She made us all write our names down on the top of the box with our Breakfast Club roles.

We all thought that this was a little over the top, but we did it anyway to please Claire's hopes and dreams.

The names went:

Claire Chloe Harper, the Princess.

Jonathan Oliver Greenwood, the Athlete.

Charlie Klondike Cooperton, the Brain.

and Skyler Hazel Clawfield, the Basket Case.

# 15. HELP

### !CONTENT WARNING!

\~~~

## Charlie

After a hard day's work, we got back to our apartment at 7. I was so surprised by how early the sun was setting that Sky literally had to calm me down and tell me how the solar system functions.

I tried my best to act as normal as I could in public for Sky, I wanted him to feel as safe with me as possible. This is his first time dating anyone, I want him to enjoy it.

Thankfully, no one was home yet. It was just me and Sky. Alone.

Returning to our bedroom, I closed the door and locked it just like last night. I saw Sky, sitting on his bed, sneering at me. He took off his backpack and threw it in the corner, pulling off his boots and his socks. He then back flopped onto the bed, releasing a sigh of relief. I joined him, laying down beside him.

"Congrats, Sky," I chirped, looking into his sparkling, sunset-pink eyes. "You completed your first full day of being in a relationship." Sky scoffed, staring back up at the ceiling. "How do you feel?"

"Jumbled... but, hopeful." He breathed, clinging onto me and snuggling into my side. "Is this okay?" He asked me.

"I should be the one asking you that," I spoke, putting my arm around him and kissing his forehead. My tail was trying so hard to wag free as I laid on it with my back, holding it down.

"This is so weird," His muffled voice said.

"Hm?"

"Never in my life would I imagine that I would be snuggling with a six-foot, caucasian, male Siberian husky."

"Damn, you know your breeds."

"Analyzing is one of the best skills acquired when being a visual person."

"Okay, Picasso. Don't get all smartass on me."

"I'd thought you'd like me like that," Sky remarked, reaching over me. Before I knew it, he began climbing over my stomach and making out with me heavily.

_Woah, what is he doing? This would seem like a lot for him, but hell, I'll go with it if he wants to._

I grabbed his tiny waist and squeezed it ardently. He's very skinny for a boy his age, but then again, he's very _anything_ for a boy his age. His paws wrapped around my neck as he kissed harder. Was he trying to choke me? Whatever he was doing, it definitely turned me on.

_No. I can't feel that way with him, it was in the rules._

But, if that's the case, why is he kissing me so erotically? _He's... basically breaking his own code of conduct. Does he want this? 'Cause he's technically sliding into second base with me, feeling up my neck and chest and stuff... Well, more like one-and-a-half base._

Sky broke off the kiss, a string of saliva stretching from our muzzles. He gasped for air as he nestled his snout into my shoulder, chuckling breathlessly.

"What was that?" I gasped in awe.

"Just trying something new." He giggled, sitting up and dismounting me.

He turned towards the door, making me think he was about to leave the room.

"Hey, you can't bail when we were just getting into it!" I bleated, rising up and chasing after him.

"I'm not bai‚ÄîWoah!" He exclaimed as I captured him, slamming his back into the door. "Don't kill me, you know I'm weak!" He laughed as I closed in on him, returning the kiss as romantically and passionately as he did earlier.

Lust took control over my body as I cornered him into the wall. I slid my paws up his neck and to his chin, tilting his lips up and into mine. I'll admit, I got a bit handsy, but not too much as it didn't seem to disturb Sky. My body pressed up against his.

Something about this... felt... so... pleasing. It was different than last night.

This time, Sky was starting to get in on the action, rubbing his hands all over my back.

I was getting way too horny. Sky might've felt the boner growing through my pants, but he seemed to go with it.

For some reason, he doesn't seem to mind what we were doing.

_Maybe... he was ready?_

_Ready for me?_

That's what his body seems to be telling me.

My muzzle transitioned to his neck. My tongue explored his soft, delicate fur thoroughly. His chest felt warm and fuzzy to the touch. I moved down to his stomach, kissing his abdomen through his dark-gray patterned shirt. Words cannot describe how badly I wanted to rip it off of him.

But then I got somewhere better.

Lowering to my knees, I became level to level with his crotch.

My inner voice was telling me to stop. Maybe Sky doesn't want this.

But my body wouldn't listen. It was too late.

I was fixated on the metallic button of his faded dark skinny jeans.

My paws rose to undo it. It popped out swiftly with a click.

_I want this._

_Sky wants this._

Don't do this, Charlie. You don't know that.

_But I do. I could tell he was ready... he's pretty easy to read._

My hands latched onto his jeans, ready to yank them off.  
  
  

That was when I felt a massive brush of pain as I was shoved back with a powerful force.

Sky had kicked me. Violently.

I fell on my back onto the carpet, holding my stomach. I had gotten the wind knocked out of me. I needed a few seconds to catch my breath.

_What the fuck is wrong with him?_

_He fucking kicked me!_

"Ow, Sky, what the fuck!" I growled, turning my head up to him.

"I... I..." He stammered, frozen in place. He started to shiver with fear, putting his hands up as though he wanted to help me.

_He should've thought about that before he crammed his foot through my digestive system._

"I thought you wanted that!" I shouted at him with anger.

"I-I'm sorry, I‚Äî" He whimpered, not knowing what to say.

"Here we go again, with the fucking sorries," I grunted, slamming my hand on the ground.

Woah, should I be saying these things? I promised Sky I wouldn't take things too seriously...

_But he fucking hurt me. You have a right to be mad._

"God, I'm trying, Sky!" I raged, letting all my emotions spill out. "I'm trying my best to help you, but you're just so hot and cold all the time! I can't fucking read you! Next time, give me a fucking sign, Jesus!"

"Weren't you listening to me?!" Sky squeaked, his face full of horror and concern. "I called your name a thousand times! I kept telling you to slow down, to stop!" He was on the verge of crying.

_Shit._

He had been ordering me to stop the whole time, but I wasn't paying attention.

I was so self-involved, trying to suck his dick for my own pleasure.

I was unresponsive, no matter how loud he shouted my name.

That must've terrified him. He freaked out, trying to find any way to remove me from his body before it was too late, hence, resulting in him kicking me in the stomach.

And I had yelled at him, making him think it was his own fault.

Now, he's a combination of fear and confusion. He doesn't know how to think or act in situations like these, dropping him off into a hole of uneasiness and despair.

He was frightened of both me and himself.

And it was all my fault.

"Oh, Sky," I sighed, looking down to the floor, ashamed of myself.

"I'm sorry, I-I-I really am, Charlie, I didn't mean for that to happen, I'm sorry‚Äî" He stammered, backing up against the wall.

I felt so bad for him. I had singlehandedly made everything worse, probably threatening his experience of being my boyfriend. I needed him to know that everything was okay.

"Hey, no, don't apologize." I wished, rising to my feet and approaching him slowly as to not scare him. "This was my fault, not yours."

"But, I made you think that‚Äî" He mumbled.

"You didn't make me think anything, I was overcome by my own selfish desires," I admitted, holding my hands out.

"But, b-but‚Äî"

"No buts, I'm sorry. I humbly apologize." I spoke softly, touching his shoulders gently. "I thought it was okay when it, clearly, was not. This was all my fault. You hear that?"

Sky looked up at me, displaying me his saddened and worried face. I hate to see it.

"I don't want you to be afraid of me, Sky. Come here." I whispered, pulling him into an embrace, tenderly and delicately.

His skitterish and nervous body collided with my chest, not hugging me back.

"I'm so sorry, Sky. I would give anything for you to forget this ever happened. I hope you can forgive me." I comforted him, closing my eyes as I held him. "Please forgive me‚Äî"

"I was raped, Charlie."  
  
  

My eyes opened up wide after hearing that confession come out of Skyler's mouth.

Sky left my arms, walking away from me, hiding his eyes from mine. He wrapped his arms around himself. He looked so helpless.

"Can we just go to sleep?" Sky dismissed, walking slowly to the bed, climbing onto the far side of it, facing the wall.

I stood there, watching him, completely frozen in place.

I was taken over by complete and utter shock.

Cautiously, I made my way over to the bed.

I laid myself onto it, facing the ceiling, giving us a little space in between.

I wanted to hug Sky, apologize a million times, kiss him, do anything to make him comfortable again. But I realized that not trying to force myself on him, like I had done so earlier, was the best solution.

I said nothing, did nothing. I just laid there, giving Sky his well-deserved space.

"That's why... I was so... reluctant to date you." Sky admitted, still facing the wall away from me. "It's called PTSD. I freak out every time someone holds or touches me... Hearing about, talking about, or even thinking about... sex... sets me off..."

I don't know what to say.

I don't know what to think.

I just let Sky open up to me.

"If you want to understand me, you have to know this. So I'm telling you, willingly."

My mind couldn't comprehend what I was hearing.

_Sky was... raped._

_This is why he gets so defensive._

_This is why he was afraid of dating me._

_He was raped._

_And I put it off as nothing like a fucking asshole._

_I should've respected him._

_Instead, I joked around and teased him._

_I'm a fucking dick._

"Sky..." I tried my best to utter, turning my head to the back of his body.

"I was fifteen. It was about three years ago." Sky's voice started to speak although I couldn't see his mouth move. "It was 8 o'clock or something. I was walking back home from my guitar lesson in my neighborhood."

_Why is he telling me this?_

_Does he really trust me that much?_

_If so, he doesn't deserve me. I'm not the one to open up to. I'm a terrible person and I shouldn't be the one he should be talking to about his situation._

_Maybe a therapist._

_Maybe his mom or his dad._

_At least Claire, for fuck's sake._

_Not me._

But he continued.

I wanted to stop him, but I couldn't speak.

"My house was only a few blocks down. I was walking past this block with a bunch of dark alleys, you know? Yeah, well suddenly, some... man... comes out of the shadows and grabs me. And pulls me in." His voice began to break. "I don't know what he did, but he hit me in... my pressure points on my body... I don't know... but he did something and I just froze up. I fell over. I was frozen. And... and then... he tore off..."

"You don't have to tell me this if you don't want to." I blurted, not knowing what else to say.

"No, no, it's nice to have someone else know. I can't bottle up my feelings all the time, you know?" He scoffed.

_He shouldn't be laughing at himself like this. He has a proper excuse to lash out. He doesn't need to take things so seriously, I'll be totally fine if he just broke down crying. He has a right to. But he kept talking, and I couldn't stop him. He was telling me everything. I don't deserve to hear this. I haven't helped him well enough to be granted access to his traumatic past._

"Well, he... he... he went inside of me. He pushed himself... inside me. And it hurt. And I was bleeding. And I remember him covering my mouth, preventing me from screaming... But... I just sat there. Letting him do that to me." He wept, each word followed by a gasp of air and a sniffle.

"Sky..." I tried to speak.

"I don't know what happened next... I don't know if I kicked him or something... but, somehow, I got out of there. I ran. I just ran, all the way down the street, screaming, crying, 'Help! Help me!'. I was so scared that I ran past my own house. I just kept running."

"Sky, please, stop..."

"After that, I was immediately rushed to the hospital. They... they checked me... and before I knew it... I tested HIV positive."

"Sky!" I cried, sitting up and gently touching his shoulder. I looked at him, trying to shake him from the elusive state that he was in. He was staring at the wall monotonously, bawling excessively, lying on the bed coldly.

"Any day now I can die from AIDS or any other disease, I don't know."

"Sky, stop!"

"But... they committed a search. And they found out... that that man... had been stalking me for the past few months."

"Skyler!"

"There were pictures of me sleeping. Showering. On his wall. He knew I would be walking home that night, he knew it."

"Stop talking!"

"He traumatized me!" Sky was screaming now, pouring all of his emotions out to the wall like a bucket of water, the wave almost crushing me. "Now, I'm always living in this constant state of fear that he's watching me! Waiting for another chance to attack! Charlie, I can't be put into that position again, I can't. And I don't want to spread my disease."

"Sky... No..." I whined, falling back onto the bed, sobbing.

"And now... after all that... three years later I still wonder why. Why did he do that to me? Why did he _choose_ to do that to me? Why did he choose _me_? Why me, Charlie? If he can do it, can't others? Am I that easy to get to? What's wrong with me?!"

"NOTHING'S WRONG WITH YOU!" I yelped, wrapping my arms around him and shaking him out of his trance. His watering eyes finally turned with his head, staring at me with pure emotion and pain. "Nothing's wrong with you, Sky." I blubbered, more quietly this time. "You blame yourself for what happened. You blame yourself for what I did to you. I won't let you do that‚Äîyou can't do that, Sky. I will not allow you to believe that everything was your fault."

Sky closed his eyes and shook his head. I placed my paw on his cheek and wiped away his tears.

"You were helpless, alone, and exposed. You couldn't have avoided it. I know you may think you could've gone down another street, another path. I know you may think you could've rescheduled your lesson, but no, Sky. It was inevitable. You didn't see it coming. And that fucking sucks. People can be so evil... and disgusting... and monstrous... but that's just how life is. I need you to know that."

Sky opened his eyes.

In a yielding move, Sky surrendered himself to me, turning around to face me with his whole body in the bed. He slid in closer to me, allowing me to hold him and cherish him.

He gazed at me, his expression, his demeanor, his stare... telling me that he was hurting. Deep down, he was hurting. And he needed someone to help him. Heal him.

It has to be me.

He confessed everything to me.

He's my responsibility now.

He's already told me, countlessly, that he had no one else.  

I have to help him.

I know what I must say to him.  
  
  

"Skyler," I spoke. "I promise you... with all my heart's content... that I will help you."

Me telling Sky that... was an oath. It was a message. It confirmed his hopes in that I understood him fully... and was willing to stay by his side. No matter what happens.

That completely broke him. He nodded his head as the dam broke, the floodgates crashing open. He cried quietly into my shoulder.

He feels so cold.

_He feels so, so cold._

"I'm scared, Charlie." Sky whispered. "I'm so scared."

"Shh," I told him, rubbing his head. "I'm scared, too."

He pressed himself into my body as hard as he could, his grip fastening onto my shoulders, not wanting to let go. At that very moment, we held each other as lovingly as we possibly could.

He needs me.

And I need him.

This is my duty, now.

I must help Skyler Clawfield.

I don't have a choice.

# 16. INVITATION

\~~~

## Charlie

Waking up after a forgetful night's sleep, I found myself still in Sky's bed. I never left it from last night. My arms were wrapped around his waist. He was sitting up in bed, drawing on his sketching tablet.

Regaining all of my consciousness, I retracted my arms, yawned, and sat up in bed. I would think Sky would notice me, but he was too infatuated with his drawing and had headphones covering his ears.

I reached my arm over and snatched the headphones off his head.

He looked up at me and gawked, giving me a disparaging smile that spoke, 'you're finally awake'.

Even in the morning, his presence was stunning and delightful. I bet I looked like a trainwreck. It felt as though _he_ was the sunlight that was entering the room. He's a fucking gem.

"Hey," I spoke, tilting my head at him.

"Morning, sleepyhead." He smiled.

"Drawing again?" I questioned.

"I do it to relieve stress." He admitted, stroking his stylus pen back and forth. "When I'm worried, I need something to keep my mind off of it. I... have ADHD, so if I didn't have something to distract me, like this, I'd likely be a complete and utter mess."

"Speaking of messes," I muttered to myself, trying to pat down the sticky fur on my head. I put the headphones around my ears and heard music blasting into my ears. The volume probably wasn't that loud, but I had just woken up and the headphones were like ear muffs. I began to listen to the chorus part of an upbeat pop song. "This is good," I noted, nodding my head to the beat. "I thought you didn't listen to generic repetitive pop songs."

"The song's called 'Out of My League' by Fitz and the Tantrums," Sky informed me, snatching his headphones back and wrapping them around his neck. "And it's 'alternative'. Not pop."

"What kind of music do you listen to?" I asked, sitting to the left of him by the banister.

"Bands mostly."

"What's your favorite band?"

"Mainly Twenty One Pilots, I've been to a lot of their concerts, but, I also like Paramore, The Regrettes, Tally Hall, Wallows... I also listen to artists such as Dodie, Orla Gartland, Girl In Red... That kinda stuff. And, sometimes if I'm feeling daring, I listen to the whole Euphoria soundtrack in one go."  

"Damn, I should listen to more music 'cause I've never heard of any of those people." I laughed, Sky chuckling with me. We both looked at each other, smiling, though knowing we were both avoiding a conversation that was destined to occur.

I decided to get it over with.

"Sky, about last night," I began, Sky losing his smile and staring to the floor. "I see why you were so scared... of dating... If you don't want to do this anymore, I totally unders‚Äî"

Sky's paw suddenly clenched my muzzle, holding it closed.

"Charlie," Sky scoffed, moving his paws to my cheeks, brushing my fur delicately with his thumbs. "You don't have to worry. I know you wouldn't hurt me... You couldn't if you tried. You're too soft."

I chuckled, blushing. Sky lured my snout closer to his as he spoke.

"I still want to be your boyfriend. I still like you. A lot, actually." He swooned, pulling me in for a kiss.

"But, last night‚Äî" I tried to speak before our lips touched.

"It was just a mistake. I know it won't happen again." Sky whispered, landing our muzzles together.

I put my arms around him and tugged him closer. Sky started to giggle as we made out, causing me to laugh too. But we didn't separate the kiss, it was too precious and sweet.

We pulled apart slowly, our foreheads touching and our hands interweaving.

"I promise you... that I will keep you safe," I whispered, gently caressing his cheek.

"And I promise you... that I won't kick you again." Sky joked, causing us both to laugh again.

I coaxed him into a hug, one of friendship and warmth. I rubbed my hands over his back as Sky's fists clenched, holding me tightly.

"Oh, god," Sky cringed, pulling the embrace apart.

"What?" I wondered.

"Go take a shower, dude," He jested, removing himself from the bed. "You're sweaty, like, all over."

"I wouldn't be this sweaty if I had slept with my shirt off."

"Why do men always sleep naked, it's weird."

"It's _normal_, and we do it because we get very hot at night."

"You say 'we' as in me too."

"Sorry, I forgot, you're not a male."

"Shut up!"

\~~~

It was a Saturday, so Sky and I had most of the day off to do whatever we wanted. We started by sneaking out of the house earlier than usual. Almost half of the town was asleep as the sun was still rising in the sky, making for beautiful scenery. It had just rained last night, so the autumn trees were damp with water droplets as the sun shined its orange rays upon them.

We didn't speak for a while, as not to disturb the still, peaceful tranquility surrounding the vast, vacant landscape. We just shared passing glances. I held his hand, happy he didn't pull away. I squeezed it firmly as we strolled down the block together before heading into work at Amber's.

On weekdays, we had the afternoon shift, but on the weekend, we have the morning shift. The weekend job is my favorite since more animals stop by at the cafe to get their morning coffee before heading off to whatever they need to do. And more customers means more money!

Just kidding, it allows me to see the community more. Like my photos, I like to admire normal people's lives and ask questions.

"What happened?" I finally spoke up once we were a block away from the coffee shop.  

"Hm?" Skyler responded.

"After the... you know..." I whispered. "If you don't mind me asking."

"Oh," Sky frowned. "Well... My parents were... beyond horrified, obviously. I had to go to court since they sued the guy's family... and... I had numerous therapy sessions..."

"Jesus, that sounds terrifying." I groused, moving my paw to his back and massaging it with my finger.

"It was. Fifteen was the worst year of my life." Sky sighed, starting to breathe heavily. The memory was probably triggering him, so I rushed him to the building. _I hope he never experiences anything like that again._

It was 7 AM when we arrived at Amber's. Sky unlocked the door with his keys and held it open for me. He ran behind the register and put things into order as I set up the tables and chairs. Already, customers began to file in, all ordering their drinks and breakfast before leaving immediately. As I said, morning shifts are busy as hell. But, that didn't slow Sky's process of miniature doodles on the cups, he's an expert.

Luckily, we caught a break once the number of customers started to reduce.

I wiped down an empty table as Sky climbed up a ladder and added a new drink to the specials menu: a pumpkin spice latte.

"Have you ever tried one?" I asked him as he drew tiny pumpkins with faces on them on the chalkboard.

"I know how to make one, dunno if that counts," He said as he climbed down the ladder.

"They're really good, Sky. And super popular."

"Wow, wish I could try one right now," Sky spoke with sarcasm in his voice, rolling the ladder into the corner and compressing it.

"Well, it's not exactly rush hour, so I think it'd be okay." I hinted, opening the trapdoor and joining him behind the counter.

"I don't think we're allowed to drink our own product." Sky doubted, resting his arms on the marble surface.

"We did yesterday," I shrugged, stuffing the cleaning equipment away in a drawer.

"Because we were customers. Now we're on duty."

"C'mon, Whiskers. What's life without a little risk?" I encouraged, bopping his cap and reaching for two plastic cups, holding one out for him.

"Fine. And don't call me Whiskers." Sky sighed, adjusting his hat before grabbing the cup.

"Good boy," I beamed, grabbing the ingredients.

Once the lattes were finished, me and Sky hid away in the corner, ready to taste our concoctions. Sky sniffed the steamy drink, a little wary of what he was about to consume.

"Here, let's do this," I chuckled, wrapping my arm around his, cup in hand, intertwining our arms like people do in romance movies.

"Oh, this is cute," Sky mocked.

"Ready? Sip... in three... two..." I counted down. Once I reached one, we both took a swig of the coffee. Sky's whole face squinted as he drank it, puckering his mouth.

"Wow." Sky grimaced and coughed, touching his finger to his mouth.

"You seriously don't like it?!" I gasped, taking another sip, obviously enjoying it.

"Oh, no, it's delicious, just, really hot. I think I burned my tongue‚Äî" Sky rasped, giggling.

"Told you!" I burst, fist-bumping the air, careful not to spill my drink. "Isn't October, like, the best month ever?"

"I fail to see how one drink distinguishes a month as superior, but I'll take your word for it." Sky smirked, taking another sip. "Isn't Halloween, like, next week anyway?"

"Are you dressing up?"

"Nope."

"What?" I chortled, almost spitting out my drink. "Why not?"

"How old are we, Charlie?"

"We're not trick-or-treating, Sky. On the grounds of campus, Halloween is mostly about suggestive costumes and illegal parties. College 101."

"Parties aren't my thing."

"Oh, no! Are you one of those introverted quirky shy girls who hate all social interaction?" I teased, touching the tips of my fingers together.

"I will spill this drink down your pants." Sky threatened, pushing the cup towards my face.

"You know I kid!" I shrieked, guarding my crotch.

Sky snickered, placing the cup on the counter, grabbing my hands and relieving me of fright.

"I've watched a thousand movies, Charlie. There's... just so many things I don't like about college parties. There's drugs, alcohol... people _doing it_ in the bathroom, you know that doesn't make me comfortable."

"Aside from all that, college parties are better than you'd think."

"Eh, I don't know..." Sky faltered.

"You know what, I'm gonna force you to attend one."

"No, Charlie." Sky smirked.

"Yes, Sky. I don't want you back at home, sitting alone, doodling on your sketchpad, eating leftover chocolate like a loser, when you could be having the time of your life!"

"That sounds like a nice night, you should join me!"

"Skyler!"

"I just... I don't know, Charlie."

"Think of it... like a high school dance."

"I never attended high school dances."

"You never‚ÄîJesus Christ, you are impossible."

"Never went, never will."

"Not even prom?"

"Not even prom."

"Sky, prom is basically the dance of all dances. You have to be there, date or no date."

"I skipped it."

"God, I really wish I went to your high school just so I could ask you."

"I still wouldn't have come."

"Skyyyyy, you're killing me!"

"I mean, do you even have a party to go to? Where's your invitation?"

"I hear you guys are looking for a party." A smooth and deep voice called from behind us.

We turned around instantly to see a sly, cunning wolf with gray and white fur, a dark leather jacket, and denim jeans, leaning onto the counter at the order station. He gave off a devilish vibe, with his mischievous appearance and his intimidating demeanor.

_I mean, who even is this guy? Was he listening to us?_

We both stood there, staring at him awkwardly. I looked down at Sky, wondering if he knew what to say.

"Hi, welcome to Amber's, how may I help‚Äî" Sky attempted.  

"Cut the chit chat," The wolf interrupted, throwing an orange slip of paper onto the floor in front of us. "Party starts at 8 PM, address is on the sheet, abstinence is encouraged," He informed us, suddenly turning to my boyfriend. "I expect to see you there, handsome." He flirted, specifically speaking to Sky.

_What the fuck?_

Sky was frozen still.

"Ciao," He dismissed, leaving the building.

We both stood there like statues, a little taken aback at whatever the fuck just happened.

Sky stumbled backward and into me, pretending to have a spasm. I don't blame him, that was a bizarre occurrence.

"Wha-Wha-Wha‚Äî" Sky rattled, holding his hands up in confusion.

"Who the hell was that?" I questioned under my breath, catching Sky into my arms as he shook vigorously.

"What just happened?" Sky moaned, turning his head up to me.

"Was that real?"

Sky and I stared at each other blankly for a few seconds.

Sky snorted, causing the tips of my mouth to curl up. Then we both burst out laughing, in both confusion and bewilderment.

"Did he say 'chit chat'?" Sky mocked.

"Did he say 'ciao'?" I laughed in response.

"Did he just call me‚Äî" Sky whispered.

"Yeah, let's not think about that."

"Ooh, is Charwie Cooperton jeawous?" Sky mocked, tapping my nose.

"No, he gives me the creeps," I grunted, looking at the invite on the floor.

"Welp, you got your invitation."

"I most certainly did." I vacillated, picking the orange piece of paper off the ground.

"I'm totally going now. I wanna see more of jealous Charlie." Sky teased, nudging my shoulder.

"Shut up."

## Skyler

Once work was over at 12, me and Charlie passed our shift on to the next employee. I ran into the park next to the coffee shop and took a seat on the swings. Charlie made a quick phone call as I started to push myself, kicking my tiny feet off the grass.

"Who was that?" I asked Charlie as he finished the call and took the swing next to me.

"Oh, just Jonathan," He responded, watching at me sway back and forth. "Look at you go."

"Let's have a height contest! Who can swing the highest?" I chirped, out of breath from pushing myself harder.

"Nah, swings make me dizzy." Charlie refused.

"Lame," I whined, stopping the swing and bringing myself to the ground.

"Oh, _I'm_ lame?" Charlie scoffed, sitting up and grabbing the two chains of my swing. "You might want to rethink your word choices, Kitten." He gibed, towering over me.

"I hate dating you," I smirked, using my paw to push him away by his snout.

"All jokes aside, are you seriously enjoying this?" He asked with a caring tone of voice, crouching down to my level.

"Yes, Charlie, I am," I assured, placing my paws on his cheeks. "Stop worrying about me."

"You know that's impossible." Charlie smiled, sitting up and returning to his seat on the swingset.

"So, you've never dated a guy before?" I queried, looking at him.

"No, I haven't," Charlie told me.

"Same here."

"Yeah, no shit."

"When... When did you find out you were bisexual?"

"Hmm... Well..." Charlie hesitated. "I just... I was confused when I was younger. I always believed women were my main interest until I noticed I was, unintentionally, checking men out too. I never really came to terms with it until I... made out with one of my male friends at a high school party."

"Oh."

"It happened in ninth grade."

"You were a freshman?"

"Yeah... he was high... but I was thinking straight. Well, not 'straight', but... you know what I mean." Charlie joked as I snorted from laughter. "I was just thinking... about how much I liked him... How much we cared about each other. We only kissed once, but it got out of hand. We almost slept together."

"Yikes." I winced.

"He was the only guy I actually, well, connected with. Every other animal was female."

"How many girls have you dated?"

Charlie held up three fingers. I nodded in amazement. I don't understand how someone can have that many relationships within his years.

"Don't be so shocked, two of them forced me to go out with them and they both ended up cheating on me."

"Oh, god, I'm sorry." I grimaced.

"No worries, they were the usual, toxic, manipulative bitches you see in every high school flick. They were like Regina and Gretchen from Mean Girls."

"What a comparison," I marveled. "What about the third one?"

Charlie took a deep breath and scratched the back of his neck. I noticed his discomfort and began to grow concerned.

"Do you want to talk about her or..." I whispered, pulling my swing closer to his. "Did she hurt you really badly or something..?"

"Her name was Cassie," Charlie spoke. "And she was the best part of my life."

That was unexpected. I pulled my swing away, letting him speak.

"She was kind, friendly, compassionate... and loving." Charlie admired.

I listened to the smooth silkiness of his voice when he spoke about Cassie. I guess he really liked her.

"I loved her." Charlie chuckled, glancing up to the cloud-ridden sky. "I really loved her."

Charlie then looked at me as though he forgot I was even there. That worried me a little bit, but I really don't mind if he still has feelings for her. She'd probably be a better match for him than I would, honestly. She sounds great.

"She was a poodle," Charlie laughed, trying to change the subject. I know he felt as though he had made me uncomfortable, but he didn't. I get it, past relationships can have an effect on you. If they loved each other, why did they break up? And where is she now?

"What happened to her?" I questioned, intrigued.

"She moved away. Junior year, she left." Charlie muttered.

"Do you guys still keep in touch?"

"Yeah, a little, but we both decided that breaking up was the best choice since, like you said, long-distance relationships don't really function well enough," Charlie mumbled, staring at the floor. I could sense a bit of gloominess coming from him.

"Told ya," I joked, trying to lighten the mood. Charlie looked back at me and smiled, trying to cover up his sudden sadness.

Maybe I shouldn't have brought this up.

_Charlie is definitely hurting. He lost a really good friend._

_Was I... intruding on their life?_

_Maybe I was never supposed to come between them. Maybe Charlie belongs to Cassie... and Cassie only. Maybe I was ruining things._

"I'm sure she was very lovely..." I faltered, mirroring him in staring at the ground. "Everyone probably adored her, including you..."

"My dad never approved of her." Charlie interrupted.

"What? Why?"

"He thought she was making me soft. Making me weak. I've always tried to be respectful towards anyone I met, but like him, nobody really saw that out of me." Charlie sulked, fiddling with his paws. "But, Cassie did. And I guess... you do too."

I turned my head to him.

_Maybe... I'm not ruining things._

_It was his idea all along..._

"Your dad," I wondered. "What was he like?"

"A total asshole," Charlie laughed, sitting up in his seat. "Ever since mom left, he treated me terribly. It was like I was nothing to him, like a toy. He could just throw me around for his own pleasure, I was his fucking trophy. The only times he ever needed me were to make himself look good. He would talk with all his rich friends about how good of a kid I was, how I was acing my tests and scoring straight A's... But, when we were alone... he would..."

"Hit you?" I guessed. Charlie nodded his head dejectedly. Even though he was half-smiling, his face was full of sorrow and pain. "Charlie..." I attempted to comfort him, placing my paw on his shoulder and rubbing it gently.

"It's okay, I learned to tolerate the abuse," Charlie added.

"Was he ever nice to you?"

"Only in front of an audience. He wants people to think he's a good, humble man, with a respectful son." Charlie groaned in disgust. "That's what he wants me to be. Respectful. But, nothing ever lives up to his expectations. He just wants me to act... normal." He scoffed, shaking his head. "Fuck, sometimes I just wish I could... scream at his face and admit all the terrible things he's done... right in front of his little army of skanks."  

"What has he done?"

"I'd rather not say, but, he did do a lot of illegal cheating to get to the prosperous position he has now." Charlie sighed, rubbing his eyes.

"Jesus," I gasped in disgust.

I can't imagine how it must've been for Charlie to grow up in a household where he never felt safe. His father committed crimes that Charlie had to sit on, whether he liked it or not.

"I hate him, Sky," Charlie growled, stamping his foot on the ground. I rubbed his back, trying to keep him from exploding with anger. "He's been a terrible influence on me. He was... the main cause of my depression and my anxiety." Charlie admitted, his voice breaking. "But, Cassie... she helped me out of the hole he was digging. She helped me open my eyes. Helped me see who I truly am."

A single tear fell from his eyes.

I couldn't help but hurt for him. What Charlie went through... it's... it's traumatizing. I touched my paw to his cheek and caressed it lovingly.

"I'm sorry I put this on you," Charlie giggled through his cries.

"Oh, Charlie, don't. I asked and..." I reasoned, just for Charlie to grab my hand and squeeze it tight.

"Skyler, it's okay. Really." Charlie smiled, staring into my eyes with comfort. His were colored a fluent, night blue. They were beautiful, like two large pools of water that I could swim in for hours. I wouldn't care if I'd drown.

"Does your dad know... that you're..." I began to ask.

"Fuck, no." Charlie scowled. "I'd be dead the second he found out."

"What would he think about us?" I wondered.

"No matter what he thinks, I'll always be here for you, Sky." Charlie swooned, pulling in closer and tightening his grip on my paws. "Nothing will stop me from adoring you."

"And... if you lose me? Like Cassie?"

"I'm not making the same mistake again." He declared, kissing my paw. "This is special and I don't want to lose it."

I lunged towards him and hugged him passionately. Charlie seemed surprised at first but eventually followed along. We wrapped our arms around each other, Charlie nuzzling his snout into my back. We almost slipped off the swings.

"Charlie?" I whispered, my head tucked into his shoulder.  

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For caring about me." I told him. "You've been such a help to me these past few months... I wish I've met you sooner. I've always wanted someone to talk to. Someone who isn't a parent or a teacher, no. I wanted an actual friend. Someone I can hug when I feel down. Someone I can hold onto through the night, in my bed. Someone that can drive me away from the darkness of my own mind. Someone I can truly, truly, care about. You've shown me everything, Charlie. You've opened doors for me that I didn't even know there was a key to. You spread yourself through care, through kindness, through love. That's why Cassie saw that in you. It's why I see it in you."

"Thank you, Skyler."

"You're welcome, Charlie."

"Do you wanna go see a movie?"

"That would be great."

## Skyler

We spent the rest of the day going to the movies watching a horror flick. I don't really like horror movies, and this one was no different. It got way too scary for me at moments so I had to hide behind Charlie's arm. It seemed to be frightening to others, too. We actually saw a fox and a serval run out of the theaters looking like they were about to throw up. I may or may not have screamed a few times, but nonetheless, Charlie held my hand the whole way through. I just kind of sat underneath my sweater and ate all the popcorn. I wanted to pay for my own ticket, but Charlie insisted. I swear, he is way too generous. I think he's the most amazing person alive.

When we exited the theater, Charlie and I walked home through the sunset, hand in hand. We bought two ice cream cones at a stand on the way back and, this time, I paid. Sure, it was chilly in the October night, but Charlie was right, ice cream is really good regardless of the time. As we licked our cold desserts, we started to have a conversation about what we liked and didn't like about the movie and if we would survive if we were the characters. Charlie said I would die first. Understandable.

Once we got back to the house, I noticed it was empty, again. I guess our roommates had other things to do. Jonathan, Dylan, and Byron are always attending campus events or parties. Milo? I have no idea.

"Wait here," Charlie instructed before we entered the house.

"What‚Äîwhy?" I questioned as he ran up the steps and disappeared into the doorway. "Charlie?" I called, but no response.

_What is he doing? Oh, well, guess I'll do what he says._

I waited for a few seconds until Charlie emerged back out onto the front steps.

"What were you doing?" I asked, watching him stand at the top of the steps with his hands behind his back. I suddenly noticed he had put on a black bowtie around his shirt collar and was holding something in his hands. "Why are you wearing that?" I laughed, a little confused.

"Skyler Hazel Clawfield," Charlie began. "Will you go to prom with me?"

_Huh?_

"What?" I scoffed, perplexed.

He held his hand out, reaching for mine.

_What the heck is he doing?_

"C'mon, Whiskers," He coaxed, his paw beckoning me to join him.

I took his hand, a little disoriented. _What's going on?_

He opened his left hand and held out a prom corsage for me to put on my arm. I stared at him, not knowing how to feel as he fit my paw through the band, tightening it around my wrist.

He opened the door behind him and lured me into the living room.

Inside, Jonathan was playing electro-dance music from his phone. Though the lights were off aside from a few candles littered around, on the floor, a laser light show machine was spinning and shining steams of bright, neon green lights onto the ceiling and the walls. I saw Claire in the corner holding up a painted sign that read, 'senior prom'.

I stopped in the doorway, taking in my surroundings. Charlie joined my side, folding his left arm around my waist and pulling me into his side.

"Is... Is this prom?" I whined, closing my eyes and sighing in annoyance.

"What do you think?" Charlie whispered into my ear.

"I think you're insane." I blushed, holding my hands over my face to hide my cringe.

_He's the best boyfriend of all time._

"Let's dance." He proposed, grabbing my hands and pulling me onto the dance floor.

"I can't dance," I smiled, following him.

"Of course you can, you just don't want to."

"I wish I had a louder phone," Jonathan complained, pressing the volume button even though it was at max.

Charlie didn't even care. He just started dancing wildly and chaotic. He flailed his arms around and jumped up and down, shaking his head, breathlessly shouting the lyrics of the overly-produced techno-pop song. I couldn't hold in my smile. I stood there, awkwardly, not knowing what to do with him.

"Dance, Sky!" Claire encouraged, joining us on the dance floor.

"How much is he paying you guys?" I joked, trying to stop Charlie before he gets a concussion from head-banging too much.

"Daaaance!" Claire begged.

"I don't know how!" I moaned, settling Charlie down and holding him by his shoulders. His fur was in his face and he was still bouncing to the beat, not being able to lift his feet off the ground.

"Maybe you're not getting into the mood because this isn't your type of music," Jonathan guessed. "Any song suggestions?"

"Ugh," I scoffed, rolling my head back. "Play, 'I Dare You', by The Regrettes."

"You got it," Jonathan agreed, turning off the current music and playing my song.

"There we go," I nodded, tapping my foot to the beat once the song started.

Me, Charlie, Claire, and Jonathan spent the night dancing to our own song choices. We jumped, we sang, we cheered, and we shook ourselves like crazy. As we fooled around, sweating buckets, frolicking in the laser lights as they flashed around the room, I realized: this is happy. This is what happiness feels like. Having the best time you could possibly have. And everything is ten times better if you have friends to share it with.

I can't believe Charlie made me experience and enjoy prom night. For the first time ever.

_How is he my boyfriend? Like, how?_

_He's actually incredible. I don't deserve him. No one does_.

_I think I might be in love with him._

When we finished with Jonathan's song, Claire grabbed a hairbrush and climbed on top of the sofa. Jonathan took a flashlight and directed the beam on her, giving her the spotlight. Me and Charlie stopped dancing and looked up at her.

"Evening, ladies and gents." She commanded into the hairbrush, pretending it was a microphone. "It is now time to tally the votes and crown your Senior Prom King and Queen!"

"Oh my god, you didn't." I groaned, slapping my head into Charlie's chest.

"Hey, they haven't counted the votes yet," Charlie teased, ruffling the fur on my head.

Claire pulled out a tissue box and removed three slips of paper. She pretended to count them one by one.

"CIVA High, the votes tally a shocking one-hundred-percent!" She pretended to act shocked. I burst with laughter. "Winning by a landslide, your king and queen are Charlie Cooperton and Skyler Clawfield!"

Jonathan began to applaud us as we approached Claire, side by side.

"Oh, god," I gushed, watching Claire take out two homemade paper crowns from behind her. "This is adorable."

"Hey! That's my word!" Charlie joked.

Claire place the crowns on our heads and kissed us both on the cheek. I swooned, looking at Charlie, ecstatic in his paper crown. He's an oddball... but he's _my_ oddball.

"Make some space on the floor so the kings can have their first dance!" Claire exulted, throwing her hands up in the air in excitement.

Charlie interlocked his arm with mine as we made our way to the middle of the living room. Jonathan began to play a slow, acoustic guitar ballad. I instantly recognized the song. I think it was something along the lines of "Dear Soulmate," by Laufey; I could recognize that voice anywhere. It was like we were getting married.

Charlie positioned his paws around my waist as I laid mine over his shoulders. We began to sway back and forth to the music, taking in the sights of each other.

We made our way around the living room, arms around each other, staring into each other's eyes. Our steps were timed perfectly, revolving and rotating around the room. We danced slowly and delicately across the floor. I couldn't take my eyes away from him. He's too beautiful.

Charlie leaned in and whispered into my ear.

"Are you having fun, prom king?"

"Why wouldn't I be?" I responded.

"Does this give you enough courage to go to that Halloween party?" Charlie whispered back.

"Only if it's with you." I smiled, Charlie returning the grin. "Thank you, Charlie. Thank you for all of this."

He came closer and wrapped his arms fully around me, pulling me into a hug. I latched onto him, never wanting to let go. I could hear Jonathan and Claire quietly shuffling out of the room as to not disturb us.

_Is this what love feels like?_

"I had fun with you tonight, Charlie," I repeated, burrowing my face into his neck, loving the way he feels and holds me.

"Vice versa." Charlie chuckled, pulling us apart and landing another soft, sweet, compassionate kiss on my lips.

The kiss lasted, what seemed to be, hours. We both didn't want to pull away. We just wanted to stay here, gently swaying to the tune, our paws around each other, our muzzles intertwining, our hearts connected, beating together at the same tempo.

We broke the kiss off, our noses touching. We breathed in unison, never wanting this romantic, tender feeling to end.

Together, we swayed silently to the song that echoed throughout the room.

\~~~

Later that night, once the rest of the guys got back and the prom decorations were hidden away, Charlie and I laid together in my bed, making out passionately. This action never seemed to stop between us, but we weren't complaining.

Charlie climbed over me, kissing my forehead and squeezing my paws, pushing me deeper into the mattress.

I know I love him, but I don't know if I'm ready to tell him that. It's still so early in our relationship, I don't want to rush things. Who knows, maybe this feeling won't last very long. But, what I do know is that at this exact moment, I do love him. I love what's happening. I love us.

This is a brand new feeling.

It's energizing and wild. Adventurous. Dreamy.

We're literally swapping spit in secret while Jonathan stalls, introducing Claire to our roommates. It's like we're living a YA novel, and it's so much fun.

This is the first time in all my life that I've ever felt something real. Something exciting and whimsical. I wanted to leave everything behind and journey into the unknown with him. I want to sail across oceans and uncover buried treasure with him. I want to jump off a ledge and fly, with him guiding my wings. I want to do everything with him.

When I'm with Charlie, I feel I could do things. Things normal-me could never even imagine of doing.

I will go to that Halloween party. I will wear a costume.  

I don't care what happens, as long as I'm with him.

With Charlie.

## Skyler

Twas Monday, the eve of Halloween. After our daily Breakfast Club meeting at Amber's, Me, Charlie, Claire, and Jonathan took to the streets with our cold frappuccinos in hand. We walked through the neighborhood, taking a brisk, lovely stroll before heading into our third class.

"So, Sky, Charlie, any plans for Halloween?" Claire asked, admiring the Halloween decorations plastered all over town. "Becca invited me and Jonathan to this frat party, you guys wanna tag along?"

"Who's Becca?" I wondered, kicking off brown, damp leaves that were stuck to my Converse shoes.

"Rebecca Seabrooke. Remember when I said I had a friend here from high school? That's her." Claire informed. I nodded, looking forward to meeting this 'Rebecca'. "Her and her 'twin' Nikolai are throwing a rave for us millennials, you two should come!" Claire specifically said the word 'twin' with air-quotes, Charlie picking up on the action.

"Are they actually twins?" Charlie chuckled.

"No, but they're both wolves, so they pretend... like roleplay," Claire responded. "To be honest, I always kinda found Niko as a bit of a creep, but they're friends so I try not to judge."

Charlie and I looked at each other, thinking back to the familiar-sounding-description we saw a few days ago.

"Is there a possibility that this 'Niko' has gray and white fur, a dark leather jacket, denim jeans, and a sly disposition?" I recalled. Claire looked back at me, a little puzzled by my on-point hypothesis.

"Y-Yeah? How did‚Äî"

"He already gave us an invite," Charlie sighed, taking the infamous orange slip of paper out of his backpack.

"Wow, that's a coincidence." Jonathan scoffed, taking the flyer. "I mean, what are the odds of us getting invited to the same exact party?"

"Is this 'Niko'... gay...?" I faltered, squirming with my arms.

"Uh, I dunno," Claire laughed, weirded out by the question.

"I thought you said you had an excellent gaydar?"

"I've only met him once, okay? Why?"

"Well, he called me handsom‚Äî"

"No, he didn't, that never happened." Charlie interrupted swiftly, covering my mouth with his large paws.

"Ooh, am I sensing a love triangle?" Jonathan chuckled, punching Charlie's shoulder.

"No! Sky is all mine!" Charlie huffed and whined, tugging me by my head, locking me into a suffocating hug. Claire and Jonathan burst with laughter as I attempted to separate myself from Charlie's body.

"Speaking of Halloween, what are you guys dressing up as?" Claire queried. "I'm cosplaying as Sailor Moon!" She beamed, jumping up and down in excitement.

"I'm going as Harry Potter," Jonathan added, flashing a toothy grin. "Not much people know this, but I'm a huge sucker for J. K. Rowling novels."

"Me and Sky haven't thought about it yet..." Charlie spoke, ruffling the top of my head. It seems he likes to strike me there often. "We'll go shopping later today. Sound good?" He asked me. I nodded in response, pushing my fur back in place.

We skipped down the orange-and-red-tinted landscape the rest of the way, looking forward to the upcoming event.

# Charlie

After our 3-5 PM shift was over at Amber's, Sky and I journeyed to the local grocery store in search of our disguises. Already, we could see orange and black posters all over the front windows, advertising Halloween costumes and festivities. We pulled out a shopping basket from the stack, entering through the glass sliding doors and into the fluorescent-lit marketplace.

The store was completely empty, it was just us there. We searched the aisles, eyes wide open for whatever interested us. Unfortunately, there was almost nothing in stock. Halloween was tomorrow and the store's customers had already bought out most of their inventory ahead of time, we were almost too late.

I clicked my tongue in disappointment, turning around to see Sky struggling with a massive holiday bag of chocolates and candy.

"We... can always... stay at home..." Sky groaned, trying to lift the pile of plastic wrappers.

"Oh, you." I sighed, coming to his aid. "So pathetic." I lifted the sack of candy in a breeze and lugged it into the basket. I don't understand how someone can have such a weak structure and be so cute at the same time.

"Well, not everyone can have your perfect bod," Sky mocked, pushing me lightly.

"You're adorable," I smirked, lifting the basket up to my shoulders, showing off my muscles. I find it really funny when I make him feel like shit.

"You're annoying," He returned, rocking his head back in anguish.

It gave me another chance to get a look at his necklace, the skeleton key he always wears around his neck. I stepped up to his chest and held the accessory in my paw, feeling the metallic shape and texture of it.

"Nice chain," I observed, Sky looking at me hold the key in my hand. "I love it when you, or boys in general, wear jewelry. It's a unique fashion, you know."

"Yeah." Sky grinned, holding the key for himself. I guess he liked it when I pointed out his fashion and clothing choices.

"So, remind me, you wear all this dark clothing because..?" I asked, looking down at his outfit. A faded, small, black t-shirt with tiny dots making an aesthetic pattern along the fabric. A black and white, crop-top-sized denim blazer too small for his torso. Faded black jeans with an array of buttons along the belt strap.

"Well, uh..." Sky hesitated, crossing his arms as we walked down the aisle. "In high school, people were making fun of the way I dressed, so I resorted to black. It's neutral, no one judges it. At least I don't think."

"Do you like wearing black all the time?"

"Yeah, of course."

"Do you ever wish you could wear other things?"

"Why are you asking?" Sky questioned, causing us both to stop and stand idly in the aisle.

"Sky," I approached, placing my paws in my pockets. "I would never judge the way you express yourself. Did you use to wear women's clothes at your old school?"

Sky nodded, embarrassed.

"Sky... if you don't want to be called homophobic slurs, why did you wear that clothing in the first place?" I questioned, Sky looking down at his attire, suddenly feeling out of place. "Not that it's a bad thing, or that I'm confronting you, I actually love the way you dress... I just want to know why you wore it."

"I dunno, Charlie." He whispered in honesty. "I just... felt good in them. Felt more like myself."

The tips of my mouth curled up as I stared at him longingly. I wanted my eyes to tell him subconsciously that he was safe whenever he was with me. It's okay to open up. I want to help you. He still struggles with his anxiety, and my mission still remains the same: lure him out of his shell.

That gave me an idea.

"How about..." I began, taking his hands in mine and leading him out of the Halloween aisle, and into the female clothing section. "You be yourself for Halloween?"

Sky seemed abashed as I coaxed him into the middle of the catalog. Sky examined his surroundings, the variety of dresses, shirts and pants, artistic apparel, headwear, etc. I could see his eyes light up, looking at the mixture of color and shape.

"Go ahead, kitten," I whispered into his ear. "There's no one else here... find yourself."

I let go of Sky's hands, letting him roam the section, free of any doubt or judgment. He looked back at me, smiling sweetly, before disappearing into the array of clothing.

I put my hands in my pockets, overcome by a feeling of joy, proud of the path that I'm leading him down. A path of his own.

I left the women's section, returning to the costume aisle. The only somewhat tolerable item left in stock was a skeleton morphsuit. It was my size and it looked pretty average, like something millions of people had worn before. I took the condensed package out of the crate, shrugging. It was basically my only option.

Me and Sky met up at one of the check-out lanes. Skyler showed up with a petite, pink, fabric dress, sort of like the ones bridesmaids wear at a wedding, and a case of makeup to go with the costume. He seemed a little embarrassed to be holding the gown in front of me, but he definitely was excited to try it on.

"Looks good, princess," I commented, tapping his nose gently. He flinched, blushing profoundly.

"Are you sure... this is a good idea?" He asked me, shuffling his feet nervously.

"What do you mean?"

"I'm scared... of what people would think of me... at the party..." He mumbled, rocking back and forth on his shoes.

"No one's gonna care." I comforted. "I'm pretty sure no one's gonna notice either, with that dress and makeup, you'll look exactly like a female." I joked, taking the dress and the makeup from his hands.

"Shut up," Sky swooned, not knowing what to say.

He loves me. I know he does.

I placed our items on the conveyor belt and paid the cashier as she scanned them. She stuffed them into a plastic bag and handed my credit card back to me. She gave us the usual 'have a great day' and we left the store.

I wrapped my arm around Sky as we walked back to the car.

"I'm proud of you, you know that?" I told him.

"Yeah, yeah," Sky moaned, looking off to the side in embarrassment.

It's my mission to fix him, and that's exactly what I plan on doing. So far, everything is going according to plan. One could say better, even. I feel as though this could be too easy, but I don't want to jinx it.

Nothing in life comes easy.

Nothing.

# 20. HALLOWEEN PARTY

\~~~

## Skyler

"Can you help me zip this up?" Charlie's voice asked from behind me.

I turned around to see an almost-naked Charlie, dressed down to his underwear.

"Woah, put some clothes on!" I joked, instantly using my paw to cover his body, my eyes darting to the ceiling.

"Calm down, you wimp," Charlie jested, holding up the skeleton suit. "We're dating, we should know what it's like to see each other without our clothes."

"I'm not a wimp..." I mumbled inaudibly, Charlie not able to hear me.

"Can you help me with my costume?" He asked, fitting his feet through the suit and pulling it up over his body.

"Stand still," I told Charlie, grabbing the zipper on the back of the costume and fastening it. There were holes in the suit for his eyes, tail, and ears to stick out. Not gonna lie, he looked adorable in that costume when his small little eyes peeked through.

Every day in October certainly feels like Halloween, but of course, not as much as the actual holiday. Nobody was in-costume during school hours, apart from this one guy who ran around campus dressed up as Shrek as a joke. It was 7:30, only half-an-hour until the party. I sat in front of the mirror and did my make up. It was only a bit of eyeliner, mascara, and blush. Honestly, Charlie was right. I do look like a girl. I grabbed my dress and went to leave the room.

"Where are you going?" Charlie hollered.

"Bathroom. I need to change." I scoffed, thinking he'd probably know that by now.

"Why don't you just change in here?" He suggested.

"I... don't really feel comfortable changing in front of someone," I admitted, shifting awkwardly with my feet.

"But I just changed in front of you? I won't mind, you know. I'm your boyfriend." Charlie chuckled, approaching me in a comforting way.

"Charlie... you know me..." I mumbled. "I'm really insecure about my body and showing it to others."

"Whatever you say," He shrugged, turning around. "You can change here, I won't look."

"Promise?" I asked.

"Pinky." He stated, facing the wall and covering his eyes with his paws. He even began to whistle.

I grinned, admiring his loyalty. I swiftly unclothed myself and slipped into the pink, velvety gown. Once I pulled the straps over my shoulders, I reached for the zipper behind my back, only to feel Charlie's paws fastening it already.

"Nice ass," He whispered amorously into my ears, wrapping his arms around me from behind and kissing my neck.

"Charlie!" I growled, pushing away from his grasp. I felt betrayed.

"Hey! Hey! I'm joking!" Charlie chuckled, putting his paws on my shoulders. I could see the regret in his eyes. He did not expect that reaction. I probably had the same scared, helpless look I always do. "I would never go back on a promise. And that's one I always keep."

I breathed heavily, fidgeting with my hands worriedly. Charlie picked up on my tone and began to put on a face of concern.

"What's wrong, kitten?" He asked, placing his paws gently on my cheeks, caressing my whiskers softly.

"I'm scared, Charlie," I confessed, silently trembling.

"Of what?"

"I dunno... everything?" I mumbled, conflicted. "What will people think of me? How will they react? What'll happen to me? What if I get hurt?"

"You're not gonna get hurt." Charlie comforted, crouching down to my level. "I'm gonna be there, with you, the whole time. I want you to come to this because... I think it can help you."

"'Help me'?"

"Yeah. I think it can help you... step out. Grow. Thrive, see life for what it really is, and... enjoy it. Before it's too late. I... I wanna lure you out of your shell, but I can't do that if you don't let me. Okay?"

I nodded. Charlie smiled and stood back up on his feet, pulling me into a hug and placing a kiss on my forehead.

"Come on, Cotton Candy, we got a party to attend." He mocked, opening the door and leading me into the hallway. I groaned in annoyance, following the white husky's wagging tail.

\~~~

We met up with Claire and Jonathan in front of the large frat house where the party was located. It looked like a giant, white and blue castle with huge greek letters up in front. Already, my anxiety shot straight through the roof. The house was flooded with animals, going in, coming out, partying, throwing up, you name it. I squeezed Charlie's hand tightly, signaling to him that I was afraid. He then looked down on me and flashed another one of those warm, friendly smiles, relaxing my nerves and calming my body. To be honest, who really was I before I met him?

"Got your student ID?" Charlie asked. I nodded, cautiously. "You're gonna be okay. You have nothing to worry about." He reassured me right before we entered the house.

If I could even try to describe what was happening, just picture every petty high school party in every petty teen rom-com. There were red solo cups littered all over the floors and shelves, toilet paper hung over banisters like streamers, disco balls and flashing colors projected on every surface, etc. There were so many students dancing to the music-blasting DJ that you could easily lose someone close to you in the crowd. I grabbed onto Charlie tighter as we sifted through the sea of animals. I was already uncomfortable.

Claire and Jonathan made their way over to their friends to talk and hang out with. I'm guessing the girl that they walked up to was Rebecca, since she's the only animal I've been told about. Me and Charlie stopped in the middle of the room and looked at each other.

"Wanna dance?" He asked me, holding his hand out.

"You know I can't."

"I know you can, remember prom night?"

"That was for you and your eyes only."

"Fine. I guess I'm dancing by myself." He smirked, moonwalking backward onto the dance floor where other animals were grinding on each other.

"I'll watch," I mouthed to him, snickering.

I stepped back to the wall as he started to dance to the upbeat rhythm. I stroked my chin with my paw, pretending to judge his dancing like Simon Cowell. He then grew more intense in his movement as the song got louder and louder. I began to cringe, watching the canine throw his limbs around wildly.

Charlie saw me laughing and started to push the overexaggerated prancing farther. Others on the dance floor glared at him and laughed nastily. I don't know how he does it, but Charlie Cooperton doesn't care what other people think of him. He's a brave, independent guy. He's embarrassing himself for my entertainment, just to make me happy.

At that moment, Claire sneaked on over to me.

"What the hell is happening?" She laughed, taking in the image of Charlie's mad dancing. I almost couldn't hear her over the music.

"He's being Charlie, like always," I sighed in response.

Suddenly, Jonathan and Rebecca joined us.

"Who is that?" Rebecca said. She was a multi-colored, bright purple, fluffy wolf. She had a small muzzle, a black choker, earrings and nose rings, and a fancy British accent. She was dressed up as some sort of killer, with fake blood splattered all over her clothing. I couldn't help but notice how awfully skinny she looked.

"Our friend, Charlie. He's an oddball." Claire explained to the she-wolf.

Rebecca chuckled, looking at him. She seemed kind-hearted.

"He's also his boyfriend." I overheard Jonathan say as he pointed to me. I decided to stare at Charlie, pretending not to hear what they were saying.

"'His'?" Rebecca gasped in awe. "I thought that was a female..?"

"No, they're both boys. You'd love them, though! They're such a cute couple." Claire swooned. Rebecca seemed shocked, but quickly got over it.

"Aww. Love is love, you know." She admired. I looked over at them as Claire motioned for me to come over. I looked back at Charlie and noticed the increasing insanity of his disco-dancing. He was jumping all over the place and sweating through his fur like crazy.

I raised my finger, saying, 'one second', walked over to Charlie, and held onto his shoulders as he dizzily slowed to a stop. He bounced in place, his damp fur covering his eyes.

"Calm down," I suggested with a giggle.

"Yeah, I know." He moaned to me as if I were his annoying parent. I left him to his antics and joined the other three.

"Sky, this is my friend from high school, Rebecca." Claire introduced.

"You can call me Becca," She greeted with her smooth, British accent.

"Hi," I replied as we shook hands. "I love your accent."

"Everybody does," She beamed, laughing profoundly. She had a very bubbly personality, like a young Aunt Hilda Spellman.

"This may sound strange... but can you say one thing for me?" I asked awkwardly.

"Okay..?" She nodded, confusingly.

"Can you say 'aluminum'?" I pleaded.

"Oh, lord, everyone asks the same thing," She scoffed. Becca cleared her throat dramatically before opening it.

"Al-oo-min-ee-yum."

"Damn, that was nice." I wheezed. We both burst with laughter, Claire and Jonathan watching a friendship form seamlessly before their eyes.

"Do you ever regret dating that monstrosity?" She mocked, nodding her head towards the sweaty mess spinning out of control in the background. He certainly was getting praise from bystanders. The crowd loved him. Who couldn't?

"All the time." I jeered.

"I hope this doesn't offend you in any way, I'm just curious..." Becca began to question, I turned around, intrigued. "But are you gay or transgender? You look like a girl to me... Sorry, if that was a little out of left field, I've been trying my best to learn how to be an accepting person‚Äî"

"Oh, no, don't worry about it." I brushed it off. "I'm a male, just dressed up as a woman. This is mostly thanks to that doofus over there‚Äî"

"Who you callin' doofus?" Charlie squealed, capturing me from behind and lifting me up.

"Charlie! Rule three! Rule three!" I grunted as he carried me in the air. Claire, Becca, and Jonathan laughed as he set me down lightly, trying not to break my bones.

We followed Becca up the frat house stairwell, down the hallway, and into one of the bedrooms. Apparently, this one was Niko's. I expected to see something of interest in there, but it was mostly empty. It looked as though he was moving out, or the opposite. Unopened boxes and packages laid untouched in a corner on the floor. He did have a desk with a lamp, though, illuminating framed photos and homework. We all sat on his surprisingly tidy bed, starting small talk with each other.

"Do you guys want a drink or a snack? I basically live here, so I can hit you up." Becca asked.

"I'm in," Claire stood up.

"Me too." Jonathan agreed, probably just because he wanted to be with Claire.

"Do you guys want anything?" She asked me and Charlie before opening the door and leaving.

"No, we're good," Charlie spoke for the two of us.

"Alrighty then," She smiled. She seemed interested in us. I'm definitely interested in her, she seems great.

"Are you sure you don't want anything, Becs?" Claire asked as they walked into the hallway.

"It's fine, I already ate..." I heard Becca's voice fade as Charlie closed the door.

He stood in the center of the room, taking in his surroundings.

"This guy doesn't really seem like the creep we all know and love." Charlie assumed, examining the friendly photos on the desk.

He returned back to my side, sitting on the bed, the cushion sinking under his weight.

"Alone at last." He chuckled, sliding his paw over my shoulder.

"You need to take a shower," I advised, trying not to smell the odor coming from his armpit.

"Enjoying the party?" Charlie asked, laying down on the bed.

"I don't know. I feel misplaced, sort of." I admitted, joining him by resting my back down on the mattress.

"Aw, you okay?" He worried, receding to his mama-bear personality, snuggling me cozily.

"I can handle it. It's just a little awkward... existing in this place, you know?" I sighed, staring at the bland, gray ceiling.

"Good to know," Charlie spoke, sitting up in bed. "Hey, I gotta use the restroom, you wanna come with?" He asked.

"I... You know what, I'll be fine." I smiled, rising from the mattress.

"Are you sure? You'll be okay here alone?" He wondered, holding my paws tenderly.

"Yes, I'm sure. I think it'll be good for me to try to face things... by myself. For a change." I exhaled, looking into his deep, warm, autumn eyes. The tips of his mouth curled up.

"You're getting better already, you know that?" He flirted, brushing his finger over my jawline. "I'll be back, sweetheart," Charlie smirked as he got up from the bed and exited the room.

As soon as the door closed behind him and the silence entered the already-quiet room, my anxiety came back once again. The gray walls began to close in on me as I sat completely alone in the room for almost two minutes. I could start to hear a faint ring in my ears as the sound of my heart thumping grew louder, morphing into the muffled noise of music booming from below.

I clenched my fist, channeling my breathing. I closed my eyes as my fingers grasped the ragged edge of the mattress.

I took a deep breath in.

I took a deep breath out.

_I'm okay._

That was when the door suddenly slammed open as two animals poured into the room, their muzzle's attached to one another, stumbling onto the floor. The male and female made out intensely, gasping for air and moaning loudly. I instinctively put my feet up on the bed, frightened by what was occurring right before me. _Literally, these two random animals just barged in with no warning._

The man on top suddenly looked up at me, sending me a glare that spoke loud and clear without words: 'Get out'.

I did just that.

I ran out of the room, no words escaping my mouth. I felt even more uncomfortable now, knowing people are probably having sex all over the place. The hallway was crowded with several drunk college students, hanging all over each other. They looked down on me, like raging gods, ready to strike me down where I stand. I dashed through the hallway and down the stairwell, unnoticed. I needed to find Charlie immediately, I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. And cry. Maybe both at the same time. An overwhelming storm of anxiety and horror conquered me. Where the heck is the bathroom?

I ran through the crowd of animals on the dance floor, trying my best not to bump into anyone and cause a scene.  

That was until someone else did.

A massive, tipsy, and likely stoned bear grabbed my arm and tugged me toward him.

"Where ya going, baby?" The bear garbled. His words were drawled and sluggish due to all the alcohol in his system. He must've thought I was a girl. His huge paw was latched onto my arm, not letting me free.

"Please let go," I begged, emotionally. I grabbed his arm and tried to pry it off mine.

"Not until I know who you are, and what your number is, sweetheart." The bear slurred, leaning in towards my face. I could smell the whiskey off of his breath.

_I knew this disguise was a mistake. I knew it was a mistake coming here._

_The problem wasn't that it was obvious I was a male, the problem was that I was convincing enough to be a female._

_And women have to live like this._

_It's terrible._

So much was happening at once and I felt like I was going to break.

"I said let go!" I pleaded, but he held on tighter, squeezing my fur. His nails began to dig into my skin. People were starting to look. "Please!" I whimpered, almost crying, not knowing what to do.

"Hey!" We heard an intimidating voice roar from afar.

People all around us turned their heads to the sound. I looked behind me to see Niko, staring at the bear angrily.

"If he says let go, it means let go," Niko commanded, the whole room growing quiet with only the noise of DJ music seceding.

"'He'? What kind of drugs are you on?" He snorted, still not understanding that I'm a boy.

"Let go of the kid." He growled, closing in on the two of us. Every step he took made the room feel like it shrunk an inch. I felt so claustrophobic.

"Who are you, her boyfriend or something?" The bear chuckled.

Out of nowhere, Niko shot a stiff fist towards the bear's head, punching him in the face. Once my hand was free, I covered my mouth in shock. The whole audience let out an 'ooo' as the bear tipped over and collapsed to the floor like a Jenga tower. Niko may have been shorter than him, but he sure was stronger.

"C'mon," Niko called to me, holding his hand out. I took it, stepping over the bear that laid on the floor, unconscious. Niko and I exited the room in a hurry.

\~~~

Niko guided me into the kitchen. It was empty, which was odd considering the number of animals that attended this event. I rested my body on the kitchen counter, releasing a sigh of relief and displeasure, utterly dumbfounded by everything that was happening. Niko began to laugh hysterically, sliding down onto the floor, opposite of me. I pushed my fur back in confusion as to why he was enjoying himself so much. That was one of the scariest moments of my life.

"Woah! That was fucking insane!" He cheered, pounding his fist on the tiled ground.

"Why did you do that?" I asked him, my paws grasping the sides of the table.

"He was harassing you!" Niko reasoned, getting up from the floor. "I had to do something."

He began to join me by the counter, resting his arms on the surface of the table. Something about him felt off... I mean, something always did, but now it was more than ever. I couldn't put my finger on it. It just felt odd how all of this was happening by chance. Those two animals, me not finding Charlie or my friends, the bear, Niko saving me, the kitchen being empty...

"Thanks," I sighed, crossing my arms.

"I'm Niko, by the way." He greeted, holding his hand out for me to shake.

"I know. I'm Sky."

"I know."

After shaking paws, we stared at each other for a bit... until it became unusual. I immediately broke off the eye contact and returned to staring at the floor. Our hands separated, putting the two of us into an awkward... and uneasy state.

"You don't seem okay, you want to go home?" Niko suggested, nudging my shoulder.

"No, I'm good." I whimpered, rubbing my temples due to the migraine I was starting to receive.

"Why are you here if you're not having a good time?" Niko asked.

I was beginning to think the same thing.

_Why am I here?_

_Who did I come here with again..?_

"Uh... well..." I stuttered, attempting to backtrack in my mind. "I went here with Charlie, Claire, and Jonathan."

"Is Charlie your boyfriend?" Niko guessed.

"Yeah..? How did you know that?" I looked at him, a little suspicious.

"Why did he take you here?" Niko questioned, switching the subject instantly. "Don't you think bringing someone who's socially awkward to a party and then abandoning them is... weird?"

"He didn't abandon me... I..." I began to speak, until suddenly, it all came back to me. That weird cloud of confusion evaporated and my brain finally returned to my head. "Oh, crap! I abandoned Charlie!" I gasped, rising straight up to my feet.

"Hey, don't go so soon‚Äî" Niko encouraged, reaching for my hand.

"I'm sorry, Niko, but I really have to find him." I dismissed, heading towards the door. "Thanks for helping me out, though. We'll catch up another time."

I didn't even give him time to reply before I raced out of the kitchen and through the house. My eyes darted everywhere, searching every nook and cranny, looking for my boyfriend. He's gotta be here somewhere. _But... I can't find him..._

_Where is he?_

_Where are my friends?_

_They only went to get water and snacks... Charlie only went to the bathroom..._

_Why didn't they hear the commotion?_

_Why didn't they come to help?_

_Why did Niko, of all people, come to the rescue?_

_Where did they go?_

_Where is Charlie?_

Where is Charlie?

  

I bumped into a boy wearing a skeleton suit with five holes for his ears, eyes, and tail.

"There you are! I've been looking all over for you!" The boy said to me.

_Is that Charlie?_

_It must be him..._

_It must be._

"Hey, you okay, Whiskers?" The boy wondered, placing his paws on my shoulders.

Finally, after understanding that the boy in front of me was, in fact, Charlie Cooperton, I jumped onto him, wrapping my arms around his shoulders and hugging him firmly, not wanting to let go. Charlie chuckled, placing his hands on my back. I finally felt safe again.

I can't be without him.

"What happened, sweetheart?" He whispered into my ear, rubbing my back gently and carefully.

"I need to get out of here, Charlie."

"Why?"

"Can we just... Can we go? I'm not feeling good anymore."

"O-Okay... Do you‚Äî"

"C'mon," I muttered as I rushed for the exit, almost tearing up.

So many things happened tonight, I just want to leave.

Leave and go home.

Leave and go home with Charlie.

I left even though Charlie was still saying goodbye to Claire, Jonathan, and Becca.

So much for a good time.

# 21. SUSHI

\~~~

## Charlie

"Skyler! Hey!" I called, struggling with my costume, trying to catch up to him. Once I took the head part of the suit off, I could watch Sky hustling down the street. This is the fastest I've ever seen him walk. He did have pretty long legs, though, for a small boy like him. He was heading back to the dorm in a hurry.

When I had gone to the bathroom, I took a much longer time than I had expected. I searched the cupboards of the restroom for a stick of deodorant since Sky said I needed a shower. Then, when I was applying it, my costume's zipper got stuck and I had to reach behind my back to fasten my suit back into place. That took a while and eventually I fixed it, but when I went back into the bedroom, Sky was gone. In his place, I saw two animals having sex.

That was what started my frantic search for him.

Once I finally caught up to Sky on the sidewalk, I could see the major emotion of fear in his face. Fear, sadness, and anger. He was furiously wiping the makeup off his face, smudging it into his fur. He didn't seem to care. Usually, he does.

"Skyler? What's wrong?" I asked, trying to stop his marching with my hand.

"It's Sky." He grunted, not bothering to look at me.

"Can you stop walking for one second? I want to talk!" I reasoned, moving in front of him in an attempt to block his path.

"I'm not stopping until we're home." He argued, walking around me.

"Skyler, please stop." I pleaded strongly, following him.

"It's Sky."

"What happened?"

"I want to go home."

"Skyler, please‚Äî"

"IT'S SKY! " He shouted, stopping in his tracks, turning back at me.

That was the first time I ever heard him scream.

In anger.

At me.

His eyes were filled with rage. His fists were clenched. His stance was domineering.

"Sky‚Äî"

"I'M NOT A FUCKING GIRL! Is that what you see me as? A sissy? Someone who can easily be commanded by any male who's interested? Is that why you made me wear this dress and come to this party, I'm not a FUCKING FAGGOT! AND I'M NOT A GODDAMN WIMP!"

"What? I‚Äî"  

"I trusted you!" He cried, pointing his finger at me violently. "You made me think everything would be okay, that you'd be there, by my side, the whole time, protecting me! You said it! You promised! 'It'll help you, Sky'! 'Everything's gonna be okay, Sky'! 'You have nothing to worry about, Sky'! LIKE SHIT I DID!"

I stood there, not knowing what to do.

For the first time, I was scared. I've never heard him curse before.

There we were, underneath a flickering lamppost, in silence for a few passing seconds. Suddenly, Sky's fiery eyes dropped to horror. He took a few steps back, realizing what he's done. He covered his mouth with his paws, his eyes watering. He could see all the bystanders, watching us, concerned. He began to sniffle relentlessly and cry softly, falling to the concrete. He curled up into a ball, afraid of what's become of him.

I stared at him, silently weeping on the floor, beginning to tear up myself.

"Sky..." I murmured, lowering down to the concrete, placing my paw on his arm.

He looked up at me. His eyes were red and sore, his blue and pink fur colored a bit darker due to the dampening moisture from his tears.

"Let me take you home," I whispered, taking his paw and pulling him up to his feet. I put his arm around my back and walked him carefully down the sidewalk.

"I'm sorry," Sky mumbled, unable to speak clearly. His head drooped onto my shoulder, yawning sleepily.

"I'm sorry, too, Kitten," I responded, kissing his head and guiding him back to the house.

\~~~

Once we returned to the apartment, I sat Sky down on the couch in the living room and grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge. I handed it to him, joining him on the cushions as he sipped the ice-cold drink. We both sat, facing each other, on the couch with our legs crossed. Sky stared at the floor, his hands trembling.

"Sky? Can you do something for me?" I spoke in a quiet, relaxed tone.

He looked back up into my eyes and nodded.

"Name five things in this room." I requested.

"What?" Sky mumbled silently, his eyebrows shifting.

"Just do it, alright?"

After hesitating a bit, Sky looked around the room, not knowing what to look for.

"Uh... Nintendo..?" He murmured, staring at the switch on the counter plugged into the‚Äî"TV?"

"Keep going." I encouraged, rubbing his thigh.

"Couch... Carpet... You?" He concluded, his eyes connecting back to mine.

"Good. How do you feel now?" I whispered, holding his paw tenderly.

"Better," Sky spoke, holding his hand to his chest, feeling his heartbeat. By feeling the pulse in his arm, I could tell he was calming down.

"My mom would do that to me every time I got angry or annoyed. To calm me down." I remembered, thinking back to all those times I scraped my knee trying to ride my bike. "I'm not lying when I say you're safe with me."

Sky sighed briefly, his attention darting to his dress. He fidgeted with a section of it, playing with the fabric. He rubbed it slowly, his fingers stroking every string interwoven with each other.

"So, please," I beckoned. "Tell me what happened."

Sky stopped touching the dress and stared back at me.

He then began to tell me what had ensued after I left him in the room, explaining event after event of the disastrous Halloween party. As he spoke, I mentally cursed myself, angry that I had not been by his side, angry I did not hear or see anything as I was in the restroom, angry that I had even left him alone in the first place.

"Now that I say it out loud, it doesn't sound that bad," Skyler chuckled once he finished his story, wiping his eyes and sighing deeply. "I overreacted, classic Skyler."

"Sky, I'm so sorry. This is all my fault." I consoled, caressing his knees with my paws, my head bent down, facing the floor.

I could feel Sky's hand touching my chin, lifting it back up.

"I forgive you, Charlie," He spoke with a benevolent voice and a comforting facial expression. "It was my fault too,"

"We're both to blame here," I smiled, exhaling through my nose. Sky smiled back at me. "What was that thing that Claire said after we got our asses beat by Byron and Dylan?"

"How to... take care of a wound?" Sky hypothesized.

"No, it was something about food..."

"'Food is the best cure for pain'?" He recollected.

"That's it," I said with a snap of my claws. "You hungry?"

"Yeah, but I don't think I'm up for eating candy all night," Sky laughed, sitting his back into the couch cushions.

"What's your favorite food, then?" I proposed.

"Sushi..?" Sky answered.

"Let me make a quick phone call."

\~~~

The doorbell rang a few minutes later. I paid the delivery man from the Chinese restaurant we ordered from and took the brown paper bag out of his hands. Sky closed the door with a 'good night' and a 'thank you' as I unloaded a few trays of sushi dishes onto the dining table in the kitchen. The array of food before us looked like a painter's colorful palette. Sky broke apart the wooden chopsticks in the bag as I grabbed a metal fork from the drawer. We dined in, eating the collection of maki, sashimi, and nigiri rolls. Immediately, the troubling thoughts of the party began to leave our minds. I stared in amazement as Sky used chopsticks to dip ginger in soy sauce. He attempted to teach me how to use them but eventually failed. We laughed and filled our stomachs until the plates were clean.

"Do you think sushi can help cure a hangover?" I asked Sky, dropping the silverware into the sink.

"I hope," He giggled, twisting himself on the swirly chairs that must've come with the table. "Hey, Charlie?"

"Yes?"

"Come here for a sec."

"Okay..?" I agreed, accompanying him at the counter. "What's up?"

"I'm glad I went to the party."

"You are..?"

"You were right. It helped me."

"Seriously?"

"It made me see things, realize things, like you said. I want to step out. I want to come out of my shell. I want to do more stuff like that, but I need you to promise me something, okay?"

"What is it?"

"I'm fragile." Sky stated, opening a fortune cookie wrapper. "I'm weak, helpless, I'm sure you know all the adjectives by now..."

I nodded my head, not knowing where this was leading.

"When that bear grabbed me, I had no idea what to do. I can't defend myself when it comes to situations I can't get out of. I'm unable to stand my ground. I can't fight back, no matter how hard I try. I'm too soft and too small. That's why I need you." He spoke, cracking open the cookie and pulling out the slip of paper in between.

"In what way?"

"I need a guardian. Someone who can protect me, for real, this time. Someone like a bodyguard."

"I see,"

"I'm afraid that if Niko never rescued me from that man, something terrible would've happened. That's why I need your safety. Anyone's, really."

"Got it," I spoke, taking his paw and kissing it.

"Do you promise that you'll protect me, Charlie?"

"I promise I will protect you, Sky. Day and night." I vowed, squeezing his paws.

Sky blushed, looking at the fortune. He turned it around to show me what it said.

It read: _The love of your life stands before you, you just don't know it yet._

I chuckled, my hands grabbing hold of the sides of his neck and making out with him gingerly. I pulled him in closer, trying not to push him off the chair. Once our muzzles separated, I wrapped myself around him, locking him into an embrace of loyalty and of love, Sky returning it the same exact way. I could feel his warm body touch mine, his head nuzzling into my neck. Oddly, his shape and my build intertwined, fitting perfectly; like two puzzle pieces, as the fortune cookie hinted, we were meant to be together.

"And, by the way," I added, breaking the embrace apart. "You said your first naughty word! I'm so proud of you!" I babied him, jokingly, squishing his cheeks around with my paws.

"I hate you," He scoffed, rolling his eyes.

I picked him up off the seat and lugged him over my shoulder like a ragdoll, carrying him to the bedroom.

"Happy Halloween, Sky."

### NOVEMBER

I woke up the next morning, my head resting on Charlie's slowly rising chest. I buried myself in deeper, rubbing my nose into his fur cozily, wanting to fall back asleep. His breathing was so soothing that I could play it through my headphones instead of the usual white noise I always listen to. He may have been dressed down to his underwear again, but I didn't mind this time. I could get used to sleeping with him like this. But, what I did mind was how I was still in my dress from last night and how my makeup stained his white fur. We must've really been tired, we conked out immediately without getting ready for bed. I need a shower, desperately.

I pushed myself up from the mattress, trying not to wake Charlie, and secretly slipped around his body, my feet touching quietly the floor. Once the blood finally left my head and dropped down to its respective places, I suddenly gained the urge to sneeze. So I did, as silently as I could.

"Even your sneezes are adorable," I heard my boyfriend whisper.

I didn't need to turn around, I could already tell by the tone of his voice that he was shining that classic Charlie Cooperton smile. I scoffed, dropping my head and letting out a faint chuckle.

"I tried not to wake you," I whined, looking back at him. He had the signature look of a douchebag, a smirk on his face and his arms resting behind his head.

"I was already awake," He grinned. "I was trying not to wake you."

"How long was I out?"

"About an hour?"

"An hour?! What time is it?"

"Relax, we still have time for school, I just woke up early."

"And you watched me? For an hour?"

"I may or may not have taken some photos." He cooed, holding up his phone.

"Pervert!" I squeaked, my hand attempting to swipe for the phone, him moving farther and holding it out of my reach.

I collapsed onto Charlie's legs, reaching for the device, accidentally kneeing him in the stomach. He let out a grunt of pain as the phone dropped from his paws and into mine. I snatched away, escaping from the bed, Charlie laughing through gasps of air.

"I'm confiscating this," I instructed, taking it with me as I left to leave the bedroom.

"No! What else will I have to jerk off to?" Charlie teased.

"CHARLIE!" I gasped, suppressing the urge to vomit. I don't think I've ever blushed this hard, it felt like my cheeks were burning. "You're terrible!"

"I'm a man, aren't I?" He quipped, settling back down into the pillows.

"I'm taking a shower." I dismissed, opening the door.

"Can I join you?" He asked as I shut it.

"No!" I yelled from outside the hallway.

\~~~

"I'm so sorry," Claire sorrowed after I told her everything that had happened yesterday. She shoved me into her arms, hugging me strongly and defiantly.

"It's okay, it's okay!" I laughed, struggling to push her away. "Don't crush me! I'm small!" Surprisingly, she's a stronger hugger than Charlie. I wonder how Jonathan deals with her.

"Whoops," She winced as she let go of me, but then proceeded to place her paws on my shoulders. She's not one for personal space. "Hey, I'm proud of you. Sure, you've been through a lot of traumatic things in the past, but you came out of that frat house, alive. You're a fighter."

"Thank you, Claire," I smiled. "It means a lot."

"Oh, and by the way," Claire continued, her hands leaving me to write in her journal. "Becca won't stop fucking talking about you two, she keeps swooning over how 'love is in the air' whenever you two are around. She says, and I quote, 'those two are literally mind-fucking each other and cumming silently every five seconds‚Äî" Becca mocked with a British accent.

"Ew, good lord!" I cringed, sticking my tongue out. "We only met for, like, two minutes!"

"Jokes aside, she does support you two. She supports all people, actually, she's one of those type-of-people who welcome others, no matter what species, sexuality, belief, et cetera."

"That's sweet." The edges of my lips rose to a smile.

"You know, she's gay, too," Claire whispered.

"Really?" My interest peaked.

"Yeah, she used to have a girlfriend!" Claire spoke to me as if it were basic knowledge.

"What happened to them?"

"Well... about a year ago, her girlfriend transitioned to a boy, which caused some tension between them... They tried to stay together but it ended up failing. They both made a fair decision that it would be better if they remained friends, but sadly, something went wrong between them. They stopped talking for a while after Hannah became Henry." She sighed.

"Oh," I listened deeply. "You know, this is one of the main reasons why I never wanted to date."

"What?"

"The separation of friends. After two people become romantically entwined, it becomes their normal and they familiarize themselves with it. Once it ends, they never stay the same."

"Yeah, I guess..." Claire spoke, her voice trailing off.

"What is transitioning like?" I asked.

"I don't know, she never told me," Claire answered. "Why? Are you thinking about it?"

"Huh? Wha‚Äî?" I stuttered, the question totally throwing me off guard. I've been asked multiple things about my sexuality, but this was a whole new genre.

"It's okay if you are!" Claire added.

"N-No, no. No." I quivered, shaking my head. Claire gave me a funny look that said, 'you're acting weird'. "Okay, sometimes I do..." I whimpered, holding my hand to my forehead, balancing myself on the table.

"It's okay, Sky. It really is." She assured.  

"I've never, really, come to terms with it... I, just, always thought these feelings generated from the way bullies used to harass me... but then I found out that I felt more comfortable wearing girl's clothes and doing girl things..."

"Whoever you choose to be," Claire comforted, brushing her fingers through my fur. "I accept you. Fully."

Claire and I smiled at each other. I'm so happy I allowed her to be my friend the first day we met. I would've never known that people could be so supportive. I love her, and I love Charlie. As real friends. Nothing less.

\~~~

Now that it was the first day of November, the weather was finally coming to the point where it drops in temperature drastically. I can't wait for winter, it's my favorite season. Christmas with the family is always the best day of the year. Not because of the presents, but because I get to share a joyous evening with the people I love most.

I looked up at the cloudy sky as I walked through campus to Graphic Design class alone. I couldn't wait to see Charlie again. I began to skip subtly, savoring this worry-free feeling for as long as I could. I played with my handbag, spinning it around on my arm.

"Nice moves." I heard a familiar, sly voice speak from behind me.

I stopped instantly and turned around on my heels swiftly to see Niko, with his classic, devious stance, smirking devilishly.

"Hey, Niko," I greeted awkwardly.

"It's cold. I can see my breath." He noted, pointing at the smoke coming from his sharp-toothed muzzle.  

As always, something felt very off about his presence. I don't know how to feel about it. Every time I'm with him I feel as though, as Creedence Clearwater Revival would put it, a bad moon is rising, like, if I don't get out of there quick, something terrible might occur.

"Yeah... It's November, hehe..." I chimed, not knowing whether to smile or not smile, the end result coming out as a crooked expression. "I'm heading to class, so, don't wanna be late!" I spluttered, hoping this was a good enough excuse to escape this embarrassing situation.

"You said that we'd catch up." He goaded, not letting me leave. "How about I walk with you?"

"Don't you have a class to get to?"

"It's right next to yours."

"How do you know where my class is?"

"I've seen you, coming in and out. It's hard not to catch a bright blue and pink cat walking on campus."

"How'd you know where I worked?"

"What do you mean?"

"I mean... how did you find us? At Amber's. I just... I've been working there for three months now, I've never seen you."

"I decided to just pop in. Check it out. And then I overheard you and that husky talking about parties‚Äî"

"His name is Charlie."

"Right, Charlie, sorry."

After I made that statement, the vibe in the atmosphere between us suddenly dropped to uncomfortable.

"Did you notice me before or after our interaction at Amber's?"

He swayed on his heels, awkwardly shoving his hands in his pockets. I don't like this. Not one bit. It was better to make a dash for it now than to stay in this zone for the next few minutes.

"Gotta get to class. Bye, Niko." I parted quickly, not bothering to look at him.

Just like the night before.

\~~~

"What a creep," Claire scowled, sipping from her teacup aggressively.

Once me and Charlie's afternoon shift at Amber's was over, I told him, Claire, and Jonathan about my interaction with Niko in the employee's only room of the coffee shop.

"Total creep, why the hell did he hesitate when you asked‚Äî" Jonathan specified.

"He's probably not a creep... He probably just likes me..." I mumbled, not wanting to think that he was spying on me. Like that man from a few years ago.

"Yeah, and he's a creep!" Claire added. "I always knew something was off with him... I'm texting Becca right now." She speculated, taking her phone out of her pocket.

"If he knows where we go every day, then won't he know where we're living?" Jonathan brought up.

"God, I hope not..." I shivered. "Wait, do you think‚Äî?"

"Yeah, no, I'm calling Becca instead."

I looked over to the silent Charlie, hoping he'll shower me with his usual comforting assuagement, but instead, he was staring off into the distance, concentrated on his thoughts.

"Charlie, you okay?" I asked, touching his arm. His head jerked the second my fingers made contact as if they were icy cold.

"Huh? Oh, I'm just thinking..." He stammered, squinting his eyes.

"About?" I whispered, taking him to the corner of the room, away from Claire and Jonathan.

"I dunno..." Charlie murmured, scratching his forehead. "Niko... I‚ÄîHe's concerning. I'm worried... about you."

"I know... But, hey, you're my guardian, remember? You'll protect me... right?" I questioned, starting to grow anxious. He was acting so... off.

"Yeah, about that..."

What could he possibly mean by that?

"What‚Äî?"

"Hey, I know this is really, really bad timing, but Coach made me promise I'd do this," Jonathan interrupted, he and Claire sliding into our conversation. "But, the Timberwolves football game is coming up, uh, Thanksgiving weekend, and it'd mean a lot if you two would come and support us..!" He put his hands together awkwardly.

"How many people will be there..?" I asked.

"Uh... a-about as many people as there'd be at a normal football game?"

"How many people is that?"

"Uh‚Äî"

"Not many," Claire answered for him.

"I mean, I might go..." I shrugged, shifting my eyebrows at Charlie, thinking about how I wanted to get out more.

"Really? Great!" Jonathan beamed, bouncing with happiness.

To be honest, he's gotten a lot softer since he met Claire.

"Charlie? You'll be there, right?" I wondered, looking back at him.

His stance was timid.

If he's not going, then I'm not going.

"Can I talk to you on the way home?"

"Sure, what's wrong?" I fretted, softly holding his shoulder.

\~~~

"I won't be here Thanksgiving weekend," Charlie informed me on the drive back to the apartment.

"What?" I whimpered, squeezing his knee.

This is perfect timing. I always feel like I'm in a battle with the world. It keeps stabbing me in the back whenever I'm actually appreciating life: Me and Charlie became friends and work partners, I have a panic attack at Amber's. Me and Charlie start dating, I have another panic attack and spill my guts about my horrific past. We go to a Halloween party together, I get subdued by a drunk bear and have, once again, another panic attack.

Now, this.

World, Four, Sky, Zero.

_What more do you want from me, gods of space and time?_

"I got a call after photography class from my dad, somehow he found me," Charlie grumbled, clenching the steering wheel with his claws.

"He 'found' you?"

"I ran away from home."

"Oh my god, Charlie." I gasped. _How has he never told me this?_ "What is he going to do?"

"He's gonna give the administrators and faculty members a call if I don't..." He faulted, looking out the window in annoyance.

"If you don't, what?" I questioned, worried about what his father might make him do.

"If I don't... come to this... Thanksgiving dinner he's hosting at his house."

_Oh._

"Oh..." I spoke out loud.

_That doesn't sound too bad._

"That doesn't sound too bad."

Knowing how Charlie gets about his father, I immediately regretted saying that sentence. He scoffed and looked back at me, ticked off. I began to feel much smaller than I already am under his angry eyes.

I don't like it when Charlie is mad.

"Oh, right. I forgot. You haven't met my father." He scowled, tapping his claws on the gear shift. "Every Thanksgiving, or any holiday in that matter, he invites over all his rich, billionaire friends to gather around... and talk... and bond with their douchebaggery. The only reason I'm ever invited is so my dad can show me off as decoration, proof that he's a good parent, which he isn't. 'Look at my lovely son! So talented and smart. I'm so proud of him!', when in real life, he'd just engorge himself in alcohol and abuse me for not turning the kitchen light off. It's bullshit!" He fumed, slamming his left hand on the wheel.

"I'm sorry, Charlie..." I whispered, brushing my thumb against the fur on his paw.

"I... I fucking hate him. The only time he ever really 'loves' me is when I put on a good show. When I fake it‚ÄîWhen _we_ fake it. He's the star of the show and I'm his afterthought. And sometimes, he doesn't even act like he likes me! He cracks insulting jokes to his friends every second I enter the room, and they just snicker along like fucking children! I don't fucking get it! Are we supposed to pretend to be a happy family or not? What's the agenda, dad? Do happy families insult their children in front of other families? Is that a thing? Have I not grown up enough to know that? What kind of fucking world are we living in!?" Charlie shouted, slamming his back into the car seat behind him.

"Charlie!" I yelped, squeezing his right hand harder and holding it up to my muzzle so I could kiss it. He gasped for air after the long rant was finished as I softly caressed his arm. I rested my chin on his fist, staring at him longingly. Charlie double-parked his car beside the street. He couldn't handle yelling and driving at the same time. He sighed, dropping his hand from the wheel and onto his face, rubbing his temple.

"It's two days." I signified, brushing the fur on the top of his head like he used to do to me. "You're Charlie Cooperton, I know you can get through this, I _know_ you can."

"I don't love him."

"Don't say that, Charlie."

"Why shouldn't I? He's never been there for me, no trace of a happy memory, nothing learned or taken away, I wasn't his son to him. I was just an ornament sitting in his house." He chided, his head sulking to the floor.  

"You'll pull through this, I promise," I stated. "You'll be okay."

He looked up at me, his eyes filled with hope. It was like this whole time he forgot I was right beside him, and he had now just noticed.

"Sky..." He sighed under his breath, shaking his head. "How do you deal with me?"

"The same way you deal with me." I chuckled, him doing the same. "I'll stay home, I can't really go anywhere without you..."

"No," Charlie reflected. "You should go to the game."

"Charlie..."

"I'm serious, remember what you said last night?"

"I asked for your protection."

"And you're getting it, but in a cosmic sort of way,"

"What‚Äî?"

"If you go to this football game without me, you can prove to yourself, no one else, _yourself_, that you can have courage. That you can be brave."

"Why are you doing this?" I murmured, massaging my forehead. "Why are you so persistent in helping me? I never got to ask."

"Because..." Charlie took a deep breath. "I don't want you to wake up, 86 years old, on your deathbed, no family or friends left in your life, wishing you had done more. I don't want you to look back and curse yourself, saying 'God, what I would give to be young again, so I can live life, feel it, breathe it... before it's too late'." He said, tenderly stroking my cheek. "I don't want you to become my father," He told me. "_I_ don't want to become my father, so please, go to the game. Go with Claire. Tell Jonathan I said 'good luck'. You won't regret it."  
  
  

_What does the world have in store for me this time?_

# 23. THE CLOVERLAND TIMBERWOLVES

\~~~

## Charlie

About three weeks had passed. This month flew by faster than I had expected. November is always that one fleeting vacancy in time where you have no idea what you're doing. Halloween is over, Christmas is in season, and Thanksgiving gets almost no attention. It's basically just a race towards December so people can hang up lights and decorate the tree. I bet that's what Sky looks forward to. He keeps reminding me that Winter is his favorite season. At least November is a way for me to say farewell to the autumn traditions one last time. The orange leaves were now fading away and the temperature was taking a nosedive.

It was Friday, and Thanksgiving weekend started tomorrow. I leave tonight.

I got up early to get ready for my "vacation", packing a small bag of only three pairs of clothing, my phone and it's charger, and other classwork that my dad might ask me to show off. I sighed subtly as I zipped the small luggage opening closed. Skyler placed his arms around me and tried to motivate me, saying that I could get through this week, no problem. I left the bag on the bed for me to snatch it the second school ended. We both walked to our first class only to break apart and leave for our separate lessons.

Class just drifted. I don't know why I was being so dramatic. It's just a week, I can live with it. I guess it was because of that fucking cat. I didn't want to leave Sky, I've felt so attached to him these past few months. I'm getting a little overprotective of him, I know, but I don't give a shit. He's the closest thing I've had to an authentic significant other, besides Cassie. Well, not really. We haven't talked in a while. I've tried my best to call her whenever I had the time to, but I've been thinking about her less and less.

After me and Sky's shift ended at Amber's, I saved my last few moments with him before heading into the belly of the beast.

"You okay?" Skyler asked tenderly as I picked up my luggage nervously.

Sky has seen me from many angles; happy, sad, angry, horny... but I don't think he's ever seen me scared before. He's a feline and I'm a canine, usually, it's the other way around. Now, Sky's the one comforting me.

"I'm going back home." I sighed, grabbing my belongings off my desk. "There's nothing scarier than fearing a place where you should feel safe."

"Are you sure you don't want me to come with?" Sky suggested, rubbing my shoulder.

"No, I'm not letting you anywhere near him." I deflected almost immediately after I heard his suggestion. Imagine what my father could do to a small creature like him. "Go to the football game. If Claire texts me saying you bailed, I won't show you any mercy." I teased, wrapping my arms around him tightly and smooching his nose.

"Take care of yourself." He smiled sweetly, kissing me on my cheek.

"Thank you... for caring about me, Sky. I'll miss you."  

"It's only two days, crybaby. You won't die." He concluded, placing his paws on my cheeks and looking at me gingerly. If only he knew what I'd be risking, returning to the clutches of my father.

Sky helped me with my bag, walking me to my car. Jonathan and Claire were there to see me off, too, but also to attend the game with Sky. I told Claire to stay by his side.

"You're lucky I'm letting you off the day we win against the Ravens," Jonathan smirked, standing outside the window as I started the car. He was already in his football jersey and had all his gear on.

"Just don't break any bones while I'm gone, I can't have my best friend in shambles," I responded.

"Don't worry, I got him," Claire smirked, joining Jonathan at his side. She was sporting a blue-and-gray Timberwolves t-shirt in support of her boyfriend. They stepped back to the sidewalk as Sky came to the window.

He rested his arms on the car door and gave me a comforting look. A look that only me and him share, a sign that only we understand. He's so cute.

I already miss him. I can't wait to come back after this hellish weekend. Where everything will be back to normal.

"Seatbelt," He nodded.

"Oh, right." I chuckled, immediately clicking it into place.

\~~~

## Skyler

After Charlie took off into the sunset, Me, Claire, and Jonathan journeyed to the football arena where the game would be held. It was quite far from our apartment, but it didn't matter since we were taking Claire's car. I got in the backseat while the lovebirds took the front.

As we approached the field standing juxtapose to the sunset behind it, I noticed the overwhelming number of people on the other side of the gate. After setting eyes on the swarm of animals gathered around the bleachers, my skin began to shiver and my body began to freeze up.

"I thought you said there wouldn't be a lot of people!" I whispered worriedly to Claire as we all exited her car, slamming the doors behind us.

"I did?" Claire questioned. "I'm sure I didn't say _that_..."

"You said 'not many'!" I whined, tugging on to her arm.

"The Timberwolves are a pretty popular football team, the whole town knows about us," Jonathan added as we exited the car and slowly approached the field.

"'The whole town'?!" I moaned underneath my breath. They didn't seem to hear me, though, as we were now passing through the crowd of teenagers and adults. I clung to Claire as she put her arm around me, trying not to lose me. I really wish Charlie were here, I'd feel much calmer. He's like a life-sized stress ball.

"Alright, headin' in." Jonathan beamed, turning to the both of us, as we got to the other side of the horde.

"Go get 'em, babe." Claire wished, their mouthes kissing for a quick moment before Jonathan ran off into the brightly-illuminated field to join his teammates. I flashed him a thumbs-up awkwardly, him flashing one back. Claire giggled softly as her boyfriend got slammed by the coach for being late.

"Hey, you want popcorn?" Claire asked me, pointing to a red-and-white-striped stand to the left of us with a long line waiting. I shook my head politely. "Okie-dokes, let's go find our seats." She said with a smile.

Claire navigated me through the sea of animals once more to reach the bleachers. Metallic clinks sounded as we climbed the silver staircase onto the platform where various fans were situated, their blue-and-gray t-shirts shining underneath the floodlights. My ears began to ring as the audience cheered loudly, my paws covering my ears. Claire, noticing how the sound was disturbing me, quickly guided me towards two empty seats.

"You okay?" Claire shouted over the noise, covering her ears as well.

"It's really loud..." I attempted to respond, I don't think she heard me though, considering how soft my voice can be. "So, how does football work?" I yelled over the crowd.

"You don't know?" She returned the question.

"I was never one for sports."

"Me neither, but my father took me to multiple games with the family, so it's all infused up here." She explained, pointing at her brain. "So, basically‚Äî"

That was all she got to say‚ÄîWell, more, all I got to hear‚Äîbefore the referee blew the whistle and the Timberwolves broke up their huddle. Somehow, the screaming got even louder as the team spread apart across the field. I could see Claire's mouth moving but every word was unintelligible. I'm definitely missing some valuable information.

I began to worry, the constant cheering was making my ears bleed and I had no clue what was going on in front of me. I saw the players on the field run around in circles, passing the almond-shaped ball from one player to the next, almost tackling one another. _Why is it called football if they use their hands?_

There were cheerleaders below us doing flips and twirls, some of them jumping so high that they obstructed my view. I tried to move my head to see Jonathan, but all the players looked exactly the same. I don't even know how many minutes have passed when the round first started.

_I feel so out of place._

_Everyone around me enjoying something I don't even understand._

_I don't belong here._

_I want to go home._

Suddenly, visions started to flash through my mind.

I rubbed my temples in anguish.

I felt as though I was having a migraine.

The screaming in the background was calling me back to a vicious memory... _that night._

_The night that man grabbed me... and pulled me into the alleyway._

My PTSD was acting up again.

_I have to get out of here._

The moment that very thought ran through my mind, a player on the field ran into another, tumbling over and collapsing violently. I could hear the entire crowd wince as they saw their fallen teammate groan in pain. To the right of me, Claire was standing on her toes, her paws grasping the railing.

_It was Jonathan._

Claire immediately dashed to the staircase, escaping onto the field to aid her boyfriend, leaving me on the bleachers, alone.

That was it for me.

I stood up urgently and ran to leave. I climbed off the platform, booked towards the gate, and rushed away from the field.

I just kept running. Every step I took, an excruciating gasp of breath escaped me, but it didn't slow me down.

I just kept running.

I needed to get home. I didn't care about anything else. I didn't care that I was leaving the game and my friends. I didn't care about how far my apartment was. I didn't care that I didn't have a phone or any belongings on me. I didn't care that I was alone. I needed to run away.

I needed to run away from my memories.

  

"Sky!" I heard a voice call from the opposite side of the sidewalk.

I turned my head to see Niko, waving at me across the street.

"Niko?" I called back, him swiftly joining my side of the street, looking both ways before he crossed. "What are you doing here?"

"I was gonna go to the game... what about you? Why were you running?" Niko asked as we slowly walked down the sidewalk together.

"I... It doesn't matter... I just need to get home." I replied, looking down at my feet.

"I can call an Uber if you'd like?" He suggested, softly touching my arm.

"That would be great, actually." I whimpered, stopping in the street and turning to face him.

"Alright. Let's see here..." Niko pulled out his phone and tapped on the screen a few times.

  

_I was so focused on getting home at that moment that I forgot who he was..._ _the wolf that Charlie and my friends were concerned about._

_If only I had turned him down or just kept running... but I had done nothing to avoid him. I waited with him that night, under the lamppost for the car. The whole time. I could've left... I could've stopped what was about to happen... But no._

_I was so caught up in my own selfish desire to flee past memories instead of confronting them that I ended up in almost the exact same situation._

_It's moments like these where my ignorance and cowardly actions get the better of me._

_If only I had known..._

_That the bad moon would rise tonight._

_If only I had known._

# 24. NOSTALGIA

\~~~

## Charlie

As I drove into my hometown, all the various memories began to flood back into my head. The bookstore, the shopping mart, the playground, the high school, all the locations where my life took sudden turns. Where I met my first friend, where I had my first kiss, where I fought my first fight. I was receiving an overwhelming sense of nostalgia, but not the good kind. I may have lived here all my life and had been away for only four months, but I feel as though, in college, I have grown the most. I acted far too young for my age when I lived here, my actions were childish, my personality was immature, and my surroundings were toxic. This is a terrible place to grow up... or to raise a family.

But my dad never cared.

Each block I passed in the streets only took me closer to home. Closer to him. Ever since I left, I've dreaded this moment. The moment I'd have to confront him head-on.

"Destination arrived," I muttered to myself as I pulled up to our secluded split-level home. Inside, the lights were on and shadows blazed past the windows. Looks like dad has a few guests.

I took a deep breath.

_Remember what Skyler said._

_You can do this, Charlie._

I took the key out of the ignition. I opened the car door and marched up the dimly lit stone pathway, leading to the intimidating double doors. I could hear laughter and soft Muzak playing from inside. I could smell the ashy scent of roast turkey and mashed potatoes.

It almost feels welcoming.

It feels like a trap.

_Maybe I could make a run for it. Maybe I can take the coward's way out and never show my face to him again. Maybe..._

_Maybe I should go inside._

I rang the doorbell, bracing myself for the interesting evening I'm about to have. The second it rang, I could hear some clamor as the conversations quieted down. _Are... Are they waiting for me?_

The double doors swung open as a strong, smug, and dignified gray husky, dazzled up in a vintage suit and tie, stood between them.

My father, Hugo Alexander Cooperton.

"Ah, Charlie!" He cheered, wrapping his arms around me. I was startled by the welcoming gesture, patting him on the back instinctively. "My boy! You're finally home!"

He was bright and jubilant. He was cleanly shaven and didn't smell like whiskey for once. He squeezed me in a loving, family-like way. He separated from me, placing his muscular paws on my shoulders.

"Good to see you, too, dad," I spoke, not knowing which emotion to convey.

As he welcomed me inside, taking my coat and placing it on the rack, I noticed how... _warm it suddenly felt._ The whole house had this calming orange glow to it, like a Wes Anderson film. Has it always been like this? I'm starting to forget... _Have I really been away for this long?_

This feels strikingly different than any other Thanksgiving dinners he's hosted...

"Come, let me introduce you to everyone." My father smiled, placing a hand on my back. "Folks, I'd like you to meet my son, Charlie."

I could see four other adults approaching us with smiles on their faces. They gave off a friendly vibe as if they were excited to meet me and get to know who I am. They also seemed very wealthy and egotistical, I can't forget the fact that they could possibly be dicks on the inside, like my father. But, it feels as though something has changed. At first glance, this looks like a normal Thanksgiving gathering.

"This is Roger, he's new here." Dad introduced me to the first person to the left. Roger was a tall, masculine tiger, wearing a tuxedo and an expensive watch. He was using a cane, though I don't think he necessarily needed it to support himself.

"Yo." He greeted, our hands shaking.

"This is Michael, you recognize him," Dad told me. I didn't actually, but I acted like I did. He was a tall, skinny fox, dressed in a white polo and a black tie. He pointed finger guns at me. Awkwardly, I did the same.

"This is Serena," He continued, pointing at another fox, but with white fur. "She's actually Michael's sister. She's older than him, believe it or not. Looks good for her age, huh?" He smirked, then mimicked a cat call, Serena blushing.

"You're so funny, Hugo." She snickered suggestively.

I tried not to mind that my father just made a pass at a woman who seemed two decades younger than him.

"And finally, this is Beth. She's a little timid, don't mind her." Beth was a cat.

Strangely, one that looked like Skyler, just not with the blue and pink fur. She was a tabby.

"Nice to meet you, Charlie." She smiled as she put her hand into mine, shaking it happily. She seemed kind-hearted, the cream of the crop.

Maybe it was because she reminded me of him so much.

Is it possible that these are good people?

Has my father changed? He seems better than before... More sharp and confident...

Maybe my time away at CIVA has changed my outlook on home. I did say that I acted foolishly back then, maybe I was too self-centered to notice the great things happening around me... Not everybody can live in a household with food on the table.

Maybe... I was being like my father... selfish.

"Now that you've met everyone, there's an important matter I'd like to discuss quickly with you, it will only take a few minutes." He chuckled, me nodding in agreement.

He led me out of the living room and into his study.

This room was basically his home office. Throughout my childhood, he'd always hide himself away in here, but I never knew whether it was to do work or to get away from me. I always assumed the latter. Or both. I've only been in here a few times, but it emitted a haunting, secretive vibe. The fireplace was roaring and a bear head was mounted menacingly above it. His dark leather chair stood ominously empty behind his large brown desk. Behind him was a painting of himself on display.

I heard the door close and lock behind me.

The moment I turned around to face my father, I received a striking pain to the right side of my face.

  

My father had smacked me with the backside of his hand.

Before I could even react to the gesture, he grabbed me by the shirt and slammed me into the wall, raising me up with his arms. The collar of my t-shirt began to strangle my neck as Hugo pressed his fists into my throat.

"Well, well, well," My father bellowed from the deep darkness of his throat. "Look who's back from vacation."

_I guess I was wrong._

_He's the same._

"Dad‚Äî" I tried to speak. "You're hurting me‚Äî"

"I should be kicking your teeth in by now, but you're lucky I'm such a good father."

_No, you're not._

_This is not what a good father would do._

_This is not a good home._

_This is not a good town._

_All those worthless hopes I had generated in those past moments were gone now._

_There is no love here. Only pain and sorrow. Only hate._

_Why did I ever come back here?_

_There is nothing here.  
_

_Nothing._

_I left Sky alone for this._

"Dad, please stop‚Äî" My voice fizzled out, only choked, breathless gasps escaped me. I was stuck under my father's thumb once again, figuratively and non figuratively.

"Oh, sure, I'll stop," He growled, licking his molars. "Not until you yield yourself to me."

"Dad‚Äî!"

"You are my son, my flesh and blood. I fucked some whore to give you life and this is how you repay me? You are under my order, no matter what. Do you understand?"

_He's evil. He's a sociopath._

I'm losing my breath.

My feet won't touch the ground.

"I said, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?" He roared in my face.

His disgusting saliva hit my fur. My skin started to feel like it was burning. I could barely breathe. I felt terrifyingly claustrophobic with the limited amount of oxygen and space between me and my father.

_I want to get out._

_I want to go home._

"I... I understand..."

"Good boy..."

My father released his paws from my throat. I collapsed to the floor violently.

After a few blazing coughs and stifled gasps, I began to collect myself. My father looked down on me, watching me suffer. He was enjoying it, every second of my pain.

He'd watch my cold-blooded death with popcorn in a heartbeat.

"Why aren't you wearing anything formal?" He asked me.

"You never said anything about wearing something formal," I replied as I coughed up the last of my stomach acids.

"It said it was a dinner party. Get a clue, dipshit. Or are you too much of a degenerate to understand? Get dressed into something nice."

Here we go again.

"I don't have anything 'nice'." I challenged him, rising to my feet.

"What do you mean?" He responded.

"Well, unlike you, I don't care about my appearance. All you do is scrounge around the house, looking for money to waste on your dumb Louis Vuitton bullshit, only to show off to your friends, who, might I add, are much more successful than you."

"Shut your fucking mouth!" He barked, grabbing my shirt once again. I did little to fight back. "Get changed. I don't give a shit about what it is, just make it look nice. Got that, retard?"

"Message received, sir." I glared at him, my teeth grinding.

_No words can describe my fury for him. I want to punch him in the face... I want to crack his skull open... I want to... I..._

"Oh, and when you're done, make yourself useful and get us some more champagne. Don't embarrass me." He ordered, giving me one last deadly stare before exiting the room.

"Message. Received. Sir." I raged, even angrier this time. I was on the brink of having a total breakdown in his study.

The door slammed closed, leaving me alone in the hollow, lonely room. The atmosphere felt thick and suffocating. I could feel the warm tears streaming down my face. I slammed my foot into his desk, kicking it in anger. I ruffled my paw through my fur, beginning to weep silently.

I want to be with my boyfriend, Skyler. I want to be with my best friend, Jonathan. I want to be with my lifesaver, Claire.

Hopeless whimpers escaped me as I sulked in the hellish prison that was my own home.

I don't want to be here.

_I don't want to be here._

\~~~

I entered my old room.

It was bland, dusty, hollow, and almost completely empty. My father had likely sold all my old stuff and thrown out anything that wasn't of use. Looks like he took my leave harshly.

It used to be my safe haven, the only room in the house that I felt comfortable in. I would take photos and pin them to the bulletin board on my wall. My bed would be soft and light with bright orange blankets and dark gray pillows. My desk would hold camera equipment and notebooks to plan my next picture.

Now it's all gone. On the wall lies the ghostly empty space that used to house a photo of my mother cuddling a young me.

Some things were still left behind, though. To the right, my wooden shelf still had some old pictures and drawings. I saw my collection of crayon sketches I made when I was 8, a few polaroids and printed photos I shot, some Funko Pop figures, an old roll of film... I brushed my finger across the surface, the dust mites collecting onto my fur.

My eyes darted from the shelf to the floor, eyeing an abandoned polaroid. I bent down to pick it up off of the carpet, blowing the dirt off.

It was of me and Cassie. From 2018, when we were still dating.

I haven't seen her face in a while... I had forgotten how beautiful she was...

_Perhaps this place isn't entirely hopeless..._

I put the photograph in my pocket and opened my closet, scrummaging around for anything "nice". I found a cute button-down t-shirt with smooth fabric and black pants. I undressed and put them on quickly.

I left the room and tiptoed to the end of the hallway.

At the edge, there was a spiraling staircase that went down to the living room where Dad and his friends were. I stopped by the balcony and looked down at everyone.

My bare feet sunk into the soft carpet underneath me. I missed this carpet, it used to be my favorite part of this house. It was clean, soothing to the touch, and perfect, just as everything else was in this house. I missed this carpet, it sent a wave of nostalgia over me... but now... it was hurting me hard. It's past-satisfaction has now turned cold and bland, just like everything else here.

I want to leave so badly. To see Skyler, Jonathan, or Claire. Fucking anyone. Anything but this.

Looking down, I saw my father flirting with Serena. He had a weird posture that made him look needlessly alluring, but he seemed to achieve at seducing the young fox. He put his hand around her waist. He rubbed his thumb against her fur.

I turned around and walked away. I felt like crying. I can't deal with this anymore.

_I fucking hate him._

# 25. NOTHIN HAPPENED

### !CONTENT WARNING!

\~~~

## Skyler

"Are you okay?" Niko asked me as we drove back to my apartment in the Uber.

"I have a headache..." I responded, rubbing my temples.

"We're almost there, just a few more blocks."

I sunk into the cold leather of the back seat and stared out the window. I was starting to feel nauseous. I tried my best not to change my position. If I moved, my pain would likely get even worse. I closed my eyes, hoping it would reduce the sickness.

"When we get to your house, I can get you a glass of water or something."

Without looking, I stuck my thumb up.

I heard the wheels squeak as we pulled up to the street outside of my apartment. Niko exited the car from his side and walked around to mine, opening the door for me. He even unbuckled my seatbelt.

"I'm not dying, you know," I remarked as he pulled me out of the Uber. "You don't have to guide me every step of the way."

"Just making sure you get home safe." He smiled, wrapping my arm around his shoulders.

_Is this what it feels like to be drunk? God, that car ride really did a number on me._

Niko helped me up the stairs towards the front door. _I don't know why he's acting like my caretaker. I can walk perfectly fine... Maybe... he's actually a nice guy? And I'm just being paranoid? I am a cat, after all._

We stopped at the entrance.

I looked at him, wondering why we weren't going in. He stared at me as if I were dumb.

"Keys?" He suggested.

"Oh, right. Sorry." I recollected. "Thanks."

"Were you expecting me to open it for you?" Niko laughed as I searched my pockets, pulling out the keys. They jangled like jingle bells in my paws as I turned them into the lock.

"Well, you've been such a gentleman all night, don't blame me for falling for your tricks." I joked, opening the door.

No one else was home. _Obviously, they were all at the game._

_Actually, I think everyone in town is at the game._

We entered through the doors and into the living room. I tossed the keys onto the coffee table and collapsed onto the couch, releasing a sigh of relief. Using my feet, I kicked my shoes off. Niko made his way into the kitchen as if he lived here.

"What're you doing?" I called, closing my eyes and resting my head on the cushions, trying to let all the remaining car-sickness empty out of my head.

"Getting you water." He responded.

I could hear him pour water into a glass. _Strange, he found that glass rather quickly. Like he knew where it was._

He seemed to take a while with the water, which was weird because he already poured it. I could hear him shuffling, though.

"Where's my water?" I teased, opening my eyes and shifting my head to the right. I could see his back at the kitchen counter.

"Coming right up," Niko spoke.

He was fiddling with the glass.

Niko turned around with the drink and joined me on the couch.

"Here you are, your majesty." He smirked, handing me the cup.

"Is this tap water?" I chuckled, looking at the weird white tinge to the liquid.

"What, is tap water not good enough for you? Are you one of those spoiled rich kids who always complain about everything not being up-to-date enough?" He mocked, resting his arm on the couch.

"I swear I'm not." I cringed, getting ready to drink the water. "Oh, and thank you, by the way."

"Just being a good friend." He murmured.

It was odd, he was staring at the glass like he was waiting for me to drink it. He seemed impatient.

I took a small sip.

"Hm... I always thought tap water tasted better." I swallowed, placing the cup on the coffee table. "I really must be spoiled, huh?"

"You don't want any more?" Niko suggested, handing me back the glass.

"Jeez, you're demanding." I snorted, grabbing the water and taking a big gulp. It was a little hard for me to swallow, I had to beat my chest a few times to get it down.

Suddenly, I began to feel tired.

"Are you happy now?" I slurred, resting my head back on the couch.

"Totally." He sighed, sitting up straight.

_Ugh, I feel weird._

_Not, like, nauseous or anything, like... weird._

_Like... hypnotized._

_Where am I right now?_

_Where was I just a few minutes ago?_

_Am I awake... or asleep?_

_God, get ahold of yourself, Skyler. You're in the living room with Niko. You're just tired from a stressful evening, it's nothing._

_Quit being dramatic like you always are._

_It's annoying._

"So..." I could hear Niko's voice speak, only it sounded muffled and drowned out. "Do you.."

He then said something unintelligible.

"Huh?" I puzzled, looking at him. My vision was beginning to blur slightly.

"Do you play a lot of video games?" He repeated.

"What?" I questioned. He was looking at the game console near the TV. "Oh, no, those are just my teammates... Ahem, sorry, _roommates_." I corrected. "I don't really play video games."

"Oh? What do you do?"

"I'm mostly into art," I told him, stretching my arms towards the sky.

_I feel like I'm in a dream._

"That's cool! Can I see some of your work?"

"Yeah... I have my tablet upstairs in my room." I yawned, grasping the side of the couch in an attempt to stand up. My muscles began to feel weak. "Let me bring it down."

"Oh, I can come to your room, if you'll let me."

"Oh, uh, okay."

_I don't know why I was agreeing to this. I felt so... lost... that I decided to just... go with the flow. If it gets me to my bed faster. I'm so tired._

Niko helped me up and walked me to the staircase. As he guided me down the hallway, I considered just jumping into bed and conking out for the night.

We approached me and... Charlie's room.

_Charlie... I forgot he existed for a second... Where is he again?_

Niko opened the door, letting me search for the tablet. I grabbed the Surface Pro off of my desk and sat down on the mattress of my bed. Niko joined my side as I powered on the sketch pad. I opened my drawing application and showed him my portfolio.

"Woah..." He gazed on in amazement. He took the tablet out of my hands and swiped through my work. "These are... These are amazing!"

"Yeah?"

"Yeah! You have such a keen eye for things." He looked very involved with one of my drawings. "This one is my favorite. I love the pink-blue color scheme and the grainy texture... It feels very natural and aesthetic."

"Wow, you're a very visual person." I smiled, looking at my socks.

_Was I blushing?_

_What is going on..?_

_Where am I again..?_

_My bedroom... Me and Charlie's bedroom..._

_What time is it?_

_I can feel Niko's fingernails brush through the fur on my tail._

_Niko is coming really close to me..._

_Where is Charlie?_

_Where was I just now?_

_What did I drink?_

_I can feel a paw caressing my leg..._

_There's only one person who would do that..._

_Charlie._

_Oh, good, Charlie's here... I missed you..._

_Why aren't you with your dad? How did you get back so early?_

_I don't care, as long as you're here._

_The game was so stressful, I'm sorry I chickened out... I promised you I wouldn't... How foolish of me._

_Let me hug you, I missed your hugs._

I hugged someone.

_Let me kiss you._

I made contact with someone's muzzle.

_It was definitely not Charlie's._

I opened my eyes.

I could see Niko's face.

"NIKO!" I gasped, pushing away from him. "W-What... What are we doing?"

I stood up, backing away from the mischievous wolf.

"Hey, wait!"

"This... This isn't right. You shouldn't be here."

"Sky, no... I really think I should." Niko stood up slowly from the mattress.

"No, Niko, you should leave."

"Why? And forget this ever happened?"

"Yes, now please leave!"

Every step I took backward tightened an imaginary rope, tethered between the two of us.  

"Sky..." Niko grumbled, holding his hands out as if I were threatening him. "We just kissed. You really don't think we should talk about this?"

"No, now can you go?"

"I don't want to go, Skyler. I want to stay." He whispered, taking a few steps towards me.

"Niko, please leave my home."

"You kissed me, Skyler. _You_ kissed me, and you can't take that back."

"Niko, are you even listening to me?"

"We had a moment!" Niko lunged for me. I shrieked, darting out of the way. "Don't you think we should explore this feeling we have for each other?"

"Niko, I have a boyfriend!"

I edged towards the door.

"Let's forget about that for a second. That husky isn't like me."

"His name is Charlie!"

"Charlie doesn't understand you! He doesn't understand what you're going through!"  

"You're... You're lying!"

"Am I? Where is he right now?"

"I... I..."

"Where was he when you were running in fear, all by yourself in the middle of the night on an empty street?"

"T-That's not fair! Charlie's with his father! He has his own problems, too!"

"A real boyfriend would put your needs over his own."

"That's bullshit!"

"He abandoned you."

"No, he didn't."

"He left you at a pivotal time in your life! He never cared about you! He used you! He used you for his own benefit! He was curious, wanting to dabble in his own sexuality, just to know what it was like to suck dick! You were his pet project! Merely an experiment!"

"That's not true!" I began to tear up, holding my hand out to him in an attempt to stop him from coming any closer. "I... I... I love Charlie! He's kind, and he's warm... and..."

"That is pathetic, Skyler. He doesn't know you. I do."

"Shut up!"

"I know you, Skyler. I love you."

"STOP!"

Tears ran down my cheeks.

_I have such a headache. I don't feel alive in my body anymore._

Niko began to step closer.

"We can be together. Skyler and Niko. How it was always meant to be. I understand you, better than he ever could. Tell me, has Charlie ever even batted an eye at your work?"

"Y-Yes, of course, he has!"

"That drawing you made... Who gave a more invested description of it, me or him?"

"I... He..."

"Oh, wait, he never cared to elaborate, didn't he?"

"GO AWAY, NIKOLAI!" I screamed, grabbing a roll of scotch tape off of my desk and throwing it at him.

He ducked.

"No, Skyler, I will not go away. Not until you understand that I can be a better boyfriend." By the way his eyes were moving, I could tell he was about to grab my arms. "Just let me in."  

I ran for the door, only for Niko to race by me and slam it shut. He pressed his finger on the lock.

I was trapped inside my own room. I can't escape.

I can't fight him.

_I'm too weak._

_I'm too tired._

_He drugged me._

_He spiked the water._

"GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!" I screeched, my vocal chords beginning to cut out. I scratched my head furiously, feeling the dampness of my fur.

"Let me inside, Sky."

"NO!" I shouted hopelessly, tears fully blocking my sight.

I wiped my eyes with the back of my paw, only for Niko to clench it in his hand. His sharp claws began to dig into my fur, cutting my skin open.

"Niko, you're hurting me‚Äî"

"You're hurting yourself."

Suddenly, I felt a shocking blow to my stomach, knocking the wind out of me.

I fell to my knees, coughing and wheezing.

_I'm too weak._

_I'm too tired._

Niko jammed his paw into my throat, causing me to gag. He kneeled down to my level. I was coughing more violently now, I felt as though my throat was bleeding. He tightened his grasp around my neck, letting his nails scratch my veins. The stinging pain was too much for me to handle, coming from three different parts of my body, all done by Niko himself.

_I'm too weak._

_I'm too tired._

"Now, listen," Niko demanded, staring into my eyes, monitoring my soul. "You're going to do exactly what I tell you to, or else you'll end up with a few broken limbs. Got that?"

"Niko..." I pleaded, crying softly. "Please... please don't do this."

"Get on the bed."

_No, no, no, please..._

_Not this..._

_Anything but this..._

"I'm begging you... Please, don't do this to me. Please, not again."

"Don't worry, Whiskers, we'll be quick."

He lunged his arms around me and picked me up, violently throwing me onto the mattress.

"NO! HELP! SOMEONE‚Äî" I began to sob hysterically, Niko slamming his paw over my mouth. The only sounds I could make were muffled squeaks and sniffles.

_This can't be happening._

_This really can't be happening._

"Please, Sky..." Niko spoke under his breath. "Don't make this harder than it has to be."

He tugged me by my shirt and shoved my head into the pillow, turning me onto my stomach. He then arched my back, grabbing my hands and pinning them down onto the bed, preventing me from fighting back. He slumped his body over my backside and used his knees to hold down my feet.

"Hey, I get it, it's weird. But once this is over, we'll just forget about it, say nothing ever happened tonight because nothing really did."  

I tried to move. I was stuck.

  

_No!_

_NO, I CAN'T BE STUCK!_

_NO!_

_No, no, NO!_

_I can't move my arms.  
_

_I can't move my legs._

_I can't move my body._

_Help._

_Someone, please help me._

_Please._

No one can help me.

  

_I'm too weak._

_I'm too tired._

He touched the sides of my waist.

_This can't be happening to me._

He maneuvered his hands down my stomach.

_I can't be going through this again._

He unbuckled my jeans.

_It's unfair. It's not right._

He pulled them down my legs.

_I don't deserve this._

He stripped his pants down.

_This can't be happening._

_But it was._

_He was going to do this to me and all I could do is watch. I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything. I had no control. There was nothing that I could do except watch it play out. Let him do those things to me. I felt lifeless. I just screamed and cried into the pillow but nothing happened. Nothing happened._

"Please forgive me, Skyler."  

He grabbed my arms. _I just had to go along with it. I knew what was about to happen and the anticipation was killing me. I knew how he was going to do it, how it was going to feel, and I just waited for it to come. There was nothing I could do. That's all I can say. There was nothing. Nothing._

It happened.

He forced himself inside of me. I felt it. The piercing pain as he tore into my skin. Blood dripped down my tail. Uncomfortable. Ugly. Wretched. The worst part was that it was a familiar feeling. A bad memory. Like nostalgia. But not the good kind.

All my life, ever since the incident, my main goal was to forget it ever happened. To be free of the torture and guilt that had haunted me, keeping me up every night. But now, my past had struck me back like a boomerang. All those years were for nothing. It was going nowhere.

It's hopeless to continue on like this.

_I should just give up._

_I should..._

_I should kill myself afterwards._

_Yeah, kill myself._

_End everything._

_This world doesn't want me to be happy._

_I don't matter._

_I should just die._

_No._

_I can't let it end like this._

_I can't take my life away from others who cherish it so lovingly..._

_Mom... Dad..._

_Cal..._

_Charlie..._

_Claire... Jonathan..._

_I can't let them live their lives with a cascading Skyler-shaped-hole in their hearts._

_I can't do that to them. I can't have them embark on an even more painful journey than mine. I can't have them experience the sorrowful emptiness of grief or the sullen misery of depression... I can't have Charlie, Claire, and Jonathan thinking they could have done something to save me, imagining an alternate reality where they helped me live a better life, the thought eating away at their health and their humanity... I can't have Mom and Dad believing they made such a terrible mistake... rethinking their actions throughout the history of their life... wondering if they were ever really good parents to begin with... wondering if they were ever supposed to fall in love... to have me... to raise me... to love me..._

_If I kill myself... I kill them too._

_I have to fight back._

I have to fight back.

  

_Think, Skyler, think. How do I get out of this?_

_What can I do to stop him?_

_What are my advantages at the moment? Due to my position, not much is at hand... But he does seem to be distracted. He believes that I've given up._ _I can feel his paws pushing into mine less and less... Eventually, he'll let go._ _Maybe... If I time it just right... I can catch him off guard._

_I'm in so much pain._

_I want this to stop.  
_

_I'm the only one who can make this stop._

Niko let go of my hands.

He placed them onto my waist.

_Now's my chance._

I collected all the remaining power I had left in my body and pushed myself up from the mattress.  

All that power ran to my head.

I swung my body backward.

_CRACK!_

I smashed the back of my head into Niko's snout, separating the two of us in one quick, violent movement. I could hear Niko scream in agony as we fell in opposite directions, myself landing smoothly into the pillows perched up on my bed frame. Niko's head collided with the sharp wood on the other side, most likely injuring him.

Judging by the sound of his screeches, I was most definitely right.

Instinctively, I pulled up my pants and immediately grabbed whatever was in reach, chucking it at Nikolai. First, it was the pillows. That didn't seem to do much, but it definitely seemed to keep him at bay. He was getting weaker.

I could hear him yelling for me to stop. I couldn't, even if I wanted to. He violated me. He abused me. I want him dead.

He was getting restless with my impactful boxing.  

He was weak.

He was tired.

I searched for other things to throw. My hand landed on something metal. I held it in my hands. Without looking.

I swung it across his face.

It smashed against his head.

I heard glass break.

  

It felt good.

I hit it on his skull a second time.

A few more times.

Angry screams released from my mouth every time I struck him.

I didn't even know that I just broke my own sketchpad.

I just wanted him to hurt.

His blood felt cold.

It was only a soft wound, nothing major.

I watched his limp body sink down into the bed.

His blood ran down the wall.

  

I didn't kill him.

I didn't.

  

Nothing happened.

  

Nothing.

Happened.

# 26. THE BODY AND TGE EMBALMER

### !CONTENT WARNING!

\~~~

## Skyler

The slight ringing in my ears blocked out the gruesome silence that echoed off the walls within my own bedroom. I felt cold, stiff, frozen... as if a needle had injected cement into my bloodstream. All the sounds around me were muffled and foggy. I sat there, looming over his body like a hawk, feeling no soul within the temple of my consciousness. I saw the diamond-shaped tears fall from my face and mix into his blood. The sight shook me to my core. I felt as though I was viewing something I shouldn't be seeing. An explicit video you watch on a secret website. It was utterly disgusting, yet, I couldn't look away. I watched the color of red stain the bed sheets just like watercolor traveling across a puddle of water.  

This is art. I created this. The newest installment to my portfolio.

_Am I a murderer?_

_Am I evil? Deranged? Unstable?_

_No, it was self-defense._

I finally snapped back to reality.

Everything, all at once, unleashed itself onto me, attacking my senses, driving me insane. The ambiance of the room tortured my eardrums, the same way putting your head up against a speaker on full volume would. The cuts on my arm and throat returned to their unpleasant ways, hammering down a stinging pain to every part of my skin. The area where the wolf violated me... it felt like my insides were pouring out onto the mattress.

I screamed in agony, clawing at my head.

_My claws have never extracted before._

_They always hid underneath the tips of my fingers._

_They were shy._

_Now they were fucking angry._

Without thinking of the consequences, I dug my claws into the cheeks of my face, scraping them through the surface of my fur and skin. Another screech of misery escaped me as I cut into myself even harder. Hurting myself felt good at a time like this. I couldn't let him be the one to hurt me, I was always supposed to do it to myself. The only person that can do this to my body is me.

My voice is dying out. Never in my life had I thought it could reach this level of volume. I began to moan and ache profoundly, squeezing my eyelids shut to drain them of their never-ending tears. I gasped for air like a madman. I felt as though my whole body was melting and fading into dust. I wrapped my arms around my waist, holding myself. He had no right to enter my body. He had no right to try to take away my virginity.

_Am I still a virgin? Even after being raped two times?_

_I have to be._

_I want to be._

_If I'm not, it's not fair._

_I always kept my distance from sex, but if I ever were to have it, I'd want my first time to be special. Pure and wholesome. Right. Not wrong._

_This is wrong. This is not the way I want to lose it._

_How dare he. How dare he take that opportunity away from me. That choice._

_I'm still a virgin, I don't care what anybody says._

I looked at my surroundings, tense and jittery.  

_What to do, what to do..._

_Get help... Call the police..._

_I don't have a phone..._

_The wolf... He had a phone with him to call the Uber... Maybe he still has it..._

I searched the wolf's pockets, placing my hands on a rectangular shaped object. I took out the mobile phone and swiped to the emergency contact list, immediately tapping on 911.

My hands were shivering, almost dropping the phone as it rang. My teeth chattered as I waited for someone to pick up.  

"911, what's your emergency?" The operator on the other line spoke.

I held the phone up to my ear, grateful to hear the voice of another person.

"H-Hi." I stuttered, my whole body beginning to rattle vigorously. My nerves were shot and I was convulsing like a ticking time bomb. "I'd like to report s-sexual assault..." _I can't believe I have to do this. Again._

"Who was assaulted?" The lady spoke.

"Me. It was me. I was raped." I sniffled, wiping my nose.

"Who assaulted you, miss?"

"I'm... I'm a boy. B-But‚ÄîIt was a guy from my campus‚ÄîI-I'm in college... The Cloverland Institute of Visual Arts‚Äî"

"Sorry. What's your name, sir?" She asked.

"Skyler. Skyler Clawfield. Can you please send help?" I pleaded, staring at the wolf's lifeless body.

"Where is the man that assaulted you right now?"

I gave them the wolf's name. "H-He's passed out in my bed right now, I hit him in the head with a... with a tablet. A computer, basically‚Äî" I was beginning to hyperventilate into the microphone.

"Breath in and out, sir." She suggested.

"Can you _please_ send someone?!" I groaned from the pain in my stomach.

"Where are you right now?"

"I'm in my apartment, the address is 1018 Lake Dale Drive‚ÄîCan you please, _please_ send someone!"

"Help is on the way. I'm going to need you to leave the room now, Skyler."

"I can't... I can't move." I began to cry, grabbing ahold of my thighs. They felt numb and stiff, locked into place. "I can't move my legs..! I can't move!"

"Are they injured? Broken?"

"No, they're cold... Ice cold..."

"Skyler, you just need to calm down, concentrate on the muscles within your legs, and focus on shifting them. Just breathe in and out, okay? In and out."

I began to focus on my breathing, slowing down every inhale, and every exhale. The atmosphere began to quiet down.

The feeling in my legs began to return. It felt as if they were thawing from being stuck in a block of ice for a thousand years.

"I'm starting to feel them again..." I informed the lady.

"Good, now please try your best to exit the room."

"I'm trying, I'm trying..." I whimpered, shuffling on my knees to the edge of the mattress. "Am I going to go to jail?"

"Why would you go to jail?"

"Because I killed him."

"Are you sure he's dead?"

"I..."

"Have you checked his pulse? He could still be alive."

"No, I‚Äî"

I turned my head to see the bloody-nosed wolf alive and well.

Before I could even react, he immediately socked his fist into my face.

The phone dropped to the floor, along with myself.

My head hit the carpet first, my brain getting caught into a dizzy tornado. The rest of my body collapsed onto the hard floor in one foul swoop.

"You fucking whore." I could hear the wolf growl from above me.

_I thought I defeated you._

_For once in my life, I stood up for myself._

_But, of course, the world had different plans._

Scared for my life, I desperately used my claws to pull myself across the carpet, crawling towards the door. Behind me, the wolf began to collect himself, standing up from the bed.

I tried my best to kick my feet into action, but they were still in the progress of waking up. I could only limp my way towards the exit.

It seemed so close, but as the wolf began to rise back into action, I felt as though the door was moving away. I could hear the faint voice of the lady calling for me from his phone.

"Where are you going, kitty cat?" The wolf slurred, getting up from the bed. He chuckled devilishly, taking slow, heavy steps towards me. He knew I was vulnerable. He knew I couldn't run. He took his time.

_Without looking, I knew what his face was doing. He's smirking. He's loving every bit of this._

_He wants to watch me die slowly while he fucks the life out of me because it's a game to him. Another hit on his list of victims. Keeping score._

_I fucking hate him._

_He's a scandalous, repugnant monster._

The hatred began to fuel me like an energy drink. I could feel my legs in their entirety now.

In a flash, I bounced up from the floor and raced out into the hallway. The wolf, caught off guard, chased after me, not too far behind.

I could see the stairway. The stairway leads to the front door. The front door leads to the outside. The outside leads to safety. I was so close, it was the light at the end of the tunnel.

_Just a little further._

The wolf's paw clenched my ankle, tripping me over. I fell flat on my face, possibly breaking my nose.

He dragged me by my heels, back down the hallway, dragging me back into the room, further and further from the staircase. A trail of blood leaked from my nose, staining the white carpet. I yelled for help once again.

"No one's gonna help you, sweetheart. You're all mine."

I used my remaining strength to flip my body over onto its back. The wolf let go due to the sudden action. He climbed over me, trying to hold me still.

In an instant, I slashed my claws across his face. He shrieked, his hands retracting to his new scars.

Then, I kicked him in the crotch, weakening him for the time being.

I got back up from the ground, running back to my earlier destination.

"Oh, no, you don't!" He raged, stumbling after me.  

_He's a strong wolf. It seems that whatever I do, I won't be able to diminish his health. I can only run._

As I got to the staircase, he reappeared behind me, grabbing my shoulders. He tried to wrap his arms around me, in an attempt to stop me from escaping his grasp. I put up a good fight, though. Never had I been so feisty before.

On the edge of the balcony, I pulled away from his arms. I began to flee for the door, only for the wolf to shove his paws into my back, sending me forward.

I flew through the air.

I could only brace myself for the immense pain that was about to ensue.

I tumbled down the hard, wooden staircase.

I hit my head a few times on the railway as I went down.

I slid across the polished wooden floor.

  

I laid there, lifeless.

I did not move.

I did not yell.

I just laid there, waiting for him to come down and finish the job.

I was completely and utterly done for.

  

_I give up._

_I can't do this anymore._

_I can't fight._

_I can't hurt him._

_I give up._

_All that work I had done to collect myself had been thrown away once again._

_He destroyed my health, my sanity, my hope._

_I can't do this anymore._

_The worst part is that the door is right there._

_Merely inches away._

_I could see the outside world through the small window._

_But I'm too broken to leave._

_Even if I tried, I still wouldn't be able to escape the wolf's grasp._

_He'd just drag me away again._

_There's no use. No point._

I heard him coming down the stairs, step by step.

I felt his eyes examine me, wondering why I had caused him such a struggle. It was dumb to believe I was getting out of this alive, and he knew that. He's done this before. I felt it as he raped me. He was accustomed to it, familiar. He knew what he was doing. He's done it to many people. None of his victims bested him. He was always the victor.

  

_I can't believe that I worked so hard to avoid that memory, only for it all to go to waste._

_I can't believe I had to say please fifteen times only to get nothing in return._

"Sky, I'm sorry. I really am." His voice approached me. "But you know that, as the alpha male, I have to work to get what I want. I may not understand how you feel, but put yourself in my shoes. How do you think I feel? You're making this so difficult, squirming all over the place. It's unfair. Why won't you let me inside?"

I couldn't respond. I had lost my ability to speak. Maybe even breathe.

I'm probably dead.

_Is this what death is like? The afterlife? Is it not what people say it is? You don't go to some fictitious world, no. You stay inside your body. It goes limp and you are unable to function, but you feel everything. Hear everything. I can't imagine what it's like for the people who had to be embalmed for their funeral. A stranger tearing your skin apart, pulling out your organs one by one, and all you can do is watch. There is no heaven, there is no hell. You just exist without people knowing. A stranger tearing your skin apart, pulling out your organs one by one. You scream for them to stop, but they can't hear. They're oblivious to the suffering you are going through, no matter how hard you shout. You feel everything. Hear everything. But they don't care._

_It's kind of like what I'm going through right now._

_I'm the dead body and the wolf is the embalmer. Tearing my skin apart, pulling out my organs one by one, and all I can do is watch. Beg for him to stop, but, to no avail._

_You're helpless._

_You're alone._

_You're dead._

The wolf put his paw on my back.

He flipped me over.

I give up. I don't care anymore.

"Thank you, Skyler." He smiled. "Thank you for letting me do what I have to do."

  

I closed my eyes.

_This is it._

I heard a loud slam.

The wooden floor shook.

Footsteps stomped heavily around me.

"CPD, PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR."

I could hear the sound of a taser firing as a body fell to the floor in front of me.

World, Five, Sky, Zero.



# 27. FRIENDS AND FAMILY

\~~~

## Charlie

I don't like the way my father cooks.

But, obviously, his friends do. They're all like, "Delicious, Hugo!" or, "Good job, Hugo!", as if he were a gourmet chef.

I just think they're scared of him.

The sounds of clinking and chewing filled the dining room as we feasted on our Thanksgiving dinner. I took a big helping of mashed potatoes, peas, and turkey, hoping to please my father. But, of course, it was stupid to think he'd even bat an eye. Not much talking was occurring, so the atmosphere felt a little tense. Especially after the interaction Hugo and I had earlier.

I sat at the end of the table, playing with my food. I was already sick of it. My mind felt fuzzy. I didn't know what I was doing here.  

"So, Charlie..." A voice broke the silence. It was Beth's. "What are your hobbies nowadays?" She asked, wiping her mouth with a napkin. Everyone looked at her, including my father.

"Oh, I'm, uh... I'm doing photography." I responded, awkwardly. "Yeah..."  

"Oh, cool! Is that what you want to do full-time? Where do you go to college?" Beth continued.

Usually, I get annoyed when my father's friends try to start chit-chat with me, but something about Beth's personality felt sweet and comforting.

"Oh, I go to the, uh, the Cloverland Institute of Visual Arts."

"Oh, I know that place," Roger interrupted. "Do you play football there? I heard the Timberwolves are very popular."

"No, I don't, actually," I replied.

"Do you play any sports?" Michael questioned.

It felt weird to own the spotlight in front of all of my father's friends.

"No," I answered, trying to laugh it off. This is probably the most awkward I've ever been.

"Your kid some sort of queer?" I heard Michael whisper to my father.

_Seriously? What is it with people who assume non-athletic people are always homosexual?_

I could see Beth feel visibly disturbed by that comment in the corner of my eye.

"Just because I'm interested in arts and don't play sports doesn't mean I'm‚Äî" I tried to argue.

"Charlie," Hugo muttered.

I remained back to being quiet.

"Don't waste your time on him, folks. He's not much of a talker." My dad insulted me in front of everyone.

_I only talk to those I want to, dad. And I don't want to talk to any of your friends, dad._

Ways I could've spoken back went through my head as the opportunity faded away, but I know it was better to keep quiet than to have my dad beat my ass when we're finished.

As the guests began to strike up conversation again, I could see the look on my father's face. His stare: domineering and evil. He knows I can't speak up. He knows I can't argue. He knows that if I were to do anything, he'd destroy me. Here I sat, across from him, under his thumb like a caged animal.

I want to fight him.

I want to hurt him.

But, we both know that it's no use.

I can't believe that I, Charlie Cooperton, can be tamed only from a look.

"Photography, huh? Can I see some of your work?" Beth asked, facing me like we were forming our own private conversation.

"Beth, It's ok." My dad intruded.

"No, dad, it's fine. If she wants to see my work, I can show it to her." I deflected. I took out my phone and opened Instagram. I found my business page and gave it to Beth. As she slid her finger up the phone to scroll through the photos, I could see her face light up with emotions. She seemed very impressed.

"Wow, Charlie! These are very artistic." Beth beamed, tapping on a photo to expand it. "Have you seen your son's photography, Hugo?"

"Of course, I have." _Of course, he hasn't._ "I love seeing what my son is up to these days."

Beth handed me back my phone. My dad, losing interest, turned over to Serena to flirt some more.

Once he did that, Beth looked over at me.  

"He doesn't, does he?" She whispered.

"What?" I asked.

"He doesn't love seeing what you're up to these days?"

"Huh?" I was caught off guard.

_Almost a little bit shocked?_

"I've known Hugo Cooperton for a very long time," Beth muttered, looking at the gray husky. Before you were born, actually. Let me guess, he's never mentioned me?"  

"No..." My voice trailed off.  

"I was his classmate in high school. He'd treat me well... We would share cigarettes underneath the staircases between sixth and fifth period." She chuckled as she recalled, looking at the floor. "He was a nice guy at first, but then we started dating."  

_Oh no,_ I scowled in my mind.

"He became manipulative. He tried to use me to get what he wanted."

"Oh, my god." I gasped underneath my breath, covering my mouth with my paw.

My father never became a terrible person... he always was one.

My father was always evil, always the same toxic self, from his teenage years all the way to his adult years. He never changed. He never stopped being the villain.

_I hope I never grow up to be like him._

_Wait, a second..._

_Am I like him?_

_No, I can't be..._

_I never used Cassie... I never used Skyler..._

_Or did I?_

_I specifically remember me forcing Sky into things he didn't want to do... I made him go to that party and it ended terribly... I made him go to the Timberwolves game and..._

_Is he okay?_

_Should I call Claire to see how he's doing?_

_To be honest, I kind of ditched him..._

"He can be hard, I get it. Just know that there are people out there who care about you." She pointed at my phone. I looked down at it to see the photo she tapped on earlier.

It was a selfie of me and Cassie in front of the Statue of Liberty. The time we took a trip to New Jersey. It was incredible.  

"Oh, you've, uh... you've got it wrong. She moved away months ago. Sorry." I sighed, turning my phone off and fitting it into my pocket.

"I still reckon there are more like her." She smiled, patting me on the back. The tips of my mouth slowly rose.

_She's not like the rest._

"Thank you, Beth." I beamed.

"Please, helping people is my duty in life." She smirked, sitting back into the chair.

"We're a lot alike, then." I smiled.

_She's a good person._

_My father used her.  
_

_I'm starting to wonder why my mother even married him in the first place..._

_Maybe he used her too._

_How come the only friends of my father that seem truly good are victims of his abuse? Why do bad things happen to good people? It's not fair..._

Abruptly, I felt my pocket vibrate as my phone rang out an obnoxious tune. It shocked everyone at the table.  

"Oh, sorry, guys." I startled, pulling it out of my pants. "I'm just gonna go take this." I excused myself from the table.  

I wandered out into the empty living room to see that Claire was calling me. _At this time of night? That's convenient, considering what I was thinking earlier..._

"Hey, Claire. What's up?" I greeted.  

Suddenly, I heard a panicked breathless voice sob into the microphone.  

"Woah, Claire, slow down. What happened?" I intrigued.  

_What's going on?_

Then I heard it.

What had happened.

Claire told me everything.

A dark, twisted story of events told part by part.  

A shiver was sent down my spine.  

My whole body was sent into a panic.

_Sky..._

I had to leave.

I had to leave, _now._

I rushed into the dining room with my luggage and my belongings. Hugo looked at me, wondering what exactly I was up to.

"Dad, I have to leave, it's an emergency," I told him as I jammed my arm into my coat's sleeve.  

"W-Wait, hold on just a second!" My dad called out before I turned to go. "Why are you leaving in such a hurry? Stay for a little longer!"

"Seriously, dad! It's an emergency!" I rushed, my eyes watering.

I was on the brink of tears.

_Please, dad. Please let me go._

_I need to save him..._

"Whatever it is, it can't be more important than Thanksgiving with your own family!" He slammed his paws down on the table, rising to his feet.

"Please, dad! I'm sorry, but it's serious!"

"Charlie, you are not just going leave us like this‚Äî"  

"I have to go, NOW!" I yelled, almost breaking down on the spot.  

"DON'T YOU‚Äî" He stopped, noticing the spectators around him. All of Hugo's friends looked at him, taking their first peek behind the curtain that hides who my father truly is. "Alright fine." He changed his mind, sitting back down in his seat. "Where are you going?"

"My friend got seriously injured and I need to help him." I only half-lied.

After a bit of silence, my dad put on a look that made it seem like he was about to burst with laughter. He began to choke on a bit of his food. He swallowed it and then sat back up in his chair, adjusting his tie.

"Okay, okay, you may go." My father gestured with his paw. He was struggling not to smile.

"Thank you," I sighed, grabbing my luggage. "Oh, and have a nice night," I concluded, scurrying to the door, not bothering to wonder why he was acting so strange.

Before I reached for the door handle to leave, I could hear soft whispers coming from the dining room. Hugo was beginning to wheeze from restrained laughter.

I listened in.

"What's so funny?" I heard Serena ask.

"I didn't even know he had friends!" My dad whispered, laughing hard. Suddenly, everyone else in the room, excluding Beth, began to laugh out loud as if it were the greatest punchline to any joke ever.

_It set me off, too._

_But I wasn't laughing._

"What did you just say?" I interrogated, stomping back into the dining room, catching everyone off guard. They all returned to scraping the last bits of food remaining on their shiny glass plates.

"Hm?" My father played it off.

"What the fuck did you just say about me?"

Serena choked on her wine. Everyone else at the table had gone silent.  

"Hey! Language!" Hugo huffed, standing up from the table.

"I fucking heard that, dad."

"Charlie, You can't speak like that in front of‚Äî"  

"In front of who? Your friends?" I laughed.

"Charlie, don't you dare‚Äî" He grumbled, trying his best to stop me from ruining Thanksgiving.

"You know what? No. You don't control me anymore. I can say what I want to say, and you're going to fucking listen!" I yelled, slamming my hands onto the dining table this time. "You know, friends are supposed to be kind, loyal, and trustful. You trust them, and they trust you. But, do they trust you enough to know that you're an abusive alcoholic? That you're a terrible father? A horrible influence on me? That you were never there for me, ever? In my entire fucking life?"

I watched the color drain out of my father's face. He won't respond to the question.

"Do they know that, dad? Do they fucking know that?!" I repeated, my head starting to heat up from rage.

"You know, fathers and sons are expected to have a bond greater than life itself. But, of course, the only bonds you have are with cheap whores and your wealthy job. I'm always hoping you'll change from your shitty personality, but turns out your only a father to me when there's a fucking audience! You only care about yourself and how people see you! And never about your fucking family!"

I could see the embarrassed, stiff looks on all of Hugo's friends' faces.

_This felt good. It felt good to let it all out. To let them know who he really is._

I could feel tears draining down my face. I sniffled and wiped my snout.

"My friend... no... my _boyfriend_... just got raped." I confessed.

_Why didn't I ever do this sooner? He had failed at building me into the son he wanted, and now I was rubbing it in his face. I love it._

"Now, if you would please excuse me, I have to go help my _friends._ Thank you, father. What a lovely dinner."  

I removed my hands from the table and backed away.

I took one last glance at the scenery. I savored it into my memory bank. If only I could take a photo.

The look of utter embarrassment. Shame, unease. The whole room _shone_ with humiliation.

_Payback._

_It was way more delicious than the food._

I barged through the double doors, racing down the stone pathway to my car, waiting for me like an angel in disguise. I felt like I was in a movie. My daring getaway. A turning point in the storyline of my life.

The Mini Cooper beeped as I pressed the button on the keys. I threw myself into the driver's seat and took off down the street, not giving a damn about the speed limit.

_I have to get to Skyler._

I cried the whole way back to campus. Both about Sky _and_ my father. I don't know if I can even call him that anymore.  

Every time I stepped on the gas, the car growled, fueling my anger, my hatred, and my sadness. I stopped at a red light. No one was crossing. I slammed my hand on the wheel.

"COME ON!" I shouted at the traffic light, shoving my back into the car seat.

_The light wouldn't change._

_No cars were passing._

I let out a scream of agony as I punched the roof of my car. I touched my paws to my face, wiping away my tears.

_Sky... I'm sorry..._

It turned green.

I slammed my foot on the acceleration pedal, firing my car through the intersection like lightning on a stormy night.

"Sky! I'm sorry!" I howled, my tears blurring my vision.

_I shouldn't have forced him to go to the game._

_I shouldn't have tried to change him._

_He was perfect the way he was._

_I was being selfish, just like my father._

_We're cursed._

_The Coopertons are cursed._

_Hugo Cooperton's girlfriends were manipulated and his wife died in a plane crash._

_Charlie Cooperton's girlfriend's cheated on him, left him, and his boyfriend was now a victim of rape._

_We don't deserve love._

I drove my car into town, pulling up in front of the local hospital.

I parked it, stumbled out of the car, and shoved my way through the automatic sliding doors.

I ran up to the receptionist and asked if Skyler or Claire were here. She didn't seem to understand what I was saying.

I couldn't blame her, I was a mess, I was stuttering, I was wailing... _A mess..._

_That's all I am._

"Charlie!" I heard a female voice come from behind me.

I turned around to see a fox and a lion.

Claire ran up to me and hugged me. Jonathan joined our side, placing his arm on my back.

"I'm sorry..." She spoke softly, her voice breaking.

"Where is he?!" I whimpered, placing my paws on her shoulders.

"Down the hall," Claire sniffled. She was on the brink of tears, too.

So was Jonathan.

_Sky... We all cared about him... This is the impact he had on people... He was truly a good person... One who didn't deserve any pain or suffering... But got the worst of it._

I left Claire's arms and rushed into the ER.

I walked down the aisle of patients sitting in carriers, searching for my kitten.

_Why... Why him?_

_He doesn't fucking deserve this!_

"Sky?" I called, trying to scope out his name tag on the curtains of every section.

His pointy ears. His fluffy tail.

Any of his features.

Anything. Anything that will get me to him quicker.

_Anything..._

I stopped in front of one of the patients.

A cat with signature blue fur and bright pink stripes laid unconscious before me.

There he was.

I saw Sky fast asleep in a hospital bed. Tubes were plugged into his arm and his nose, enabling him to breathe.

It was a horrifying sight.  

"Oh my god.." I cried as I ran up to him into the hospital room. I crouched down beside the bed and gently placed my hand on his chest. He wasn't breathing too well and was cold to the touch. I kissed his forehead and caressed his head softly.

_Why do bad things happen to good people?_

"I've got you, Sky, I'm right here." I whimpered, brushing his soft, delicate fur. I felt the tears stream down my cheek and drop onto his nose as I whispered sweet nothings into his ear.

_Why do good things happen to bad people?_

Claire and Jonathan came up from behind, watching me break down into a million pieces, slowly and quietly.  

They grabbed the curtains and shut us in, giving the two of us our privacy.

"I'm sorry, Skyler. I'm so sorry I wasn't there." I cried, lying my head onto his chest.

_I regretted leaving so much._

_I wish I was there, I wish I could've been the one to save him._

_I wish he could talk to me. I wish he could look me in the eyes and show me that he was okay. But he was unresponsive._

_It was killing me._

_I couldn't bear looking at him like that._

_I nuzzled my head into the fabric of his shirt, completely broken._

_I didn't know what to do, but mourning felt inevitable at this moment._

_Why can't things go the way they're meant to be?_

# 28. THE BREAKUP

\~~~

## Charlie

I waited there all night.

I waited there all morning.

I sat there, outside of his hospital room, waiting for Skyler to wake up.

It was 5:32. I was shivering. The hospital was freezing cold.

My left leg bounced rapidly. I rubbed my paws together, trying my best to stay warm.

I made a terrible mistake, choosing not to leave. My car was outside with my coat and my luggage, but I did not want to abandon Skyler as I did so foolishly yesterday.

5:40.

He's still not moving. I can see his rock-solid figure through the blurred window.

5:50.

Claire came down the hall with two cups of steaming hot coffee from Amber's.

"You don't have a coat?" She worried as she handed me the coffee.

"I couldn't leave him," I muttered, taking it from her hands.

The burning heat around the edges of the styrofoam cup began to warm my paws. I held onto it tightly for a few minutes before taking a sip.

6:00.

Jonathan comes down the hallway with crutches under his arms and Becca by his side.

She walks slowly and doubtfully.

She's scared. Scared to see what her 'twin' did to such an innocent animal.

A black cast is wrapped around Jonathan's foot. He stumbles into the chair next to Claire and wraps his arm around her, Claire snuggling closely into his chest. Becca walked up to the window and pressed her paws to it. She gasped softly, covering her mouth with her hand. She couldn't get a clear vision of Sky since the window was blurred, but it was enough to shake her.

She began to cry silently.

I walked up to the wolf and placed my hands on her shoulders tenderly, trying my best to comfort her. She collapsed into my arms, hugging me back.

"I... I'm sorry... I'm sorry he..." Becca tried to enunciate.

"Shh, It's okay... I know..." I whispered, my muzzle resting on her head, my paw rubbing her back as we swayed in an embrace of grief.

_But I didn't know... I don't know how she feels or what she's thinking..._

_I can't imagine what it's like to find out that your best friend is really a... monster. I don't know if she just found out or if she has known the whole time. What I do know is that she's hurt by this. She didn't want this to happen. She feels lied to._

_He raped Skyler, behind my back, and betrayed his best friend's trust._

_I'm more than glad that he's gone._

6:30.

The floor shook as I tapped my heel to the ground repeatedly.

Jonathan and Becca were half-asleep. Claire was on a phone call in another room.

I sat there, on the bench, bent over, resting my chin on my fists, my elbows resting on my thighs. I stared at the ground. The tile pattern on the floor. The squares, all lined up in rows.

_It feels like I've been here for months._

Unexpectedly, two adult cats, one male and one female, came rushing down the hallway. They seemed incredibly disturbed and extremely exhausted. They had bags under their eyes and their fur and clothing were messy and unkempt. It looked like they just got out of bed. I could tell they were trying their best to remain calm, but the fear in their steps uncovered the truth.

They stopped to look at us for only a moment. The female cat seemed confused as to why we were here. I was thinking the same thing.

But, that was before they entered Sky's hospital room.

_Skyler's parents._

7:00.

From the blurred window, I could see the silhouettes of Sky's parents, bent over in their chairs, watching over him. The mother was crying and the father was wrapping his arms around her. Out of everyone here, they were the most distressed. It'd be selfish to say I was more worried.

_Imagine, raising a kid to do bigger and better things... and then a stranger takes away their hope. Just like that._

They seem like good parents.

Ones that I never had.

7:20.

The mother came rushing out of the hospital room bawling, the father chasing after her. Jonathan, Claire, Becca, and I all looked at each other.

I got up from my chair.

Jonathan grabbed my hand.

"Dude, what are you doing?" He asked me, tugging me to sit back down.

"I wanted to... I wanted to‚Äî"

"No, don't make things worse."

_He probably didn't intend for that to sound so insulting..._

_I have made things worse already, but... this is the least I can do._

I broke free from his grasp and walked down the hallway.

I searched the bleak, fluorescent-lit corridors for his parents. Once I turned the corner, I could see them standing by the restrooms. The mother looked like she was having a mental breakdown, the father attempting to soothe her nerves. They wrapped their arms around each other.

_I remember when my parents used to do that..._

The mother opened her eyes to see me staring at them.

"Hello?" She called to me, breaking up the embrace.

I could see the sorrow in her eyes.

She doesn't know who I am.

_Maybe I shouldn't be doing this... Intruding on Skyler's personal life..._

"Who are you?" The father questioned, bringing me back to reality.

I had spaced out for a few seconds.

"H-Hi." I stuttered, approaching them slowly. "I don't believe we've met."

They both stared at me. I was a stranger. This was too much for them. I should leave.

"I'm Charlie. I'm Sky's... uh... I'm his roommate." I hesitated.  

"Oh... Hi, there..." The mother spoke softly, releasing a sigh of relief and loosening up her stiff figure. The father took a deep breath and closed his eyes.

"I'm Olympia, this is Thompson... We're his parents, y-you probably knew that already..." I could tell she was trying her best to hold back her emotions as she introduced herself.

Olympia was another cat, but with pink fur and white stripes. She was strikingly beautiful. Sky once told me that she had a very energetic and bubbly personality. It's disappointing that the first time we meet is under these circumstances. Thompson was yet another cat, but with blue and white fur. He seemed like a sweet and tender loving gentleman. They looked awfully young to be Sky's parents.

"I'm sorry about your son. I wish I could've done something that would've... stopped this from happening." Only then did I notice that tears were falling from my eyes, too.

"Oh, no, please, don't blame yourself." Olympia comforted, touching my shoulder.

"You seem like a good man." Thompson smiled.

_But I'm not._

"Skyler's a better one," I muttered under my breath.  

_I wish I could tell them everything, how I did this to him, how I forced him to do things out of his comfort zone, that I was to blame... But, I know Skyler would hate me for that..._

_Even more than he probably does now..._

"You know his full name?" Skyler's father asked.

"Yeah, he told me," I admitted.  

"That's funny, he..." Olympia spoke as if it were to herself. "He never liked to share his full name... He always thought it was kind of girly..."

"That means... he trusts you?" Thompson wondered, his face lighting up.  

"He does." I attempted to smile, fidgeting with my paws.

Olympia and Thompson looked hopefully at each other.  

They were suddenly happy... Happy to hear that Skyler had a friend.

_I wish I could tell them... But, I can't do that to Sky._

7:40.

Skyler woke up.  

Me, Jonathan, Claire, and Becca watched as his figure sat up through the blurred window. The shadows of his parents were there, by his side, hugging him tightly.

I walked up to the window, hoping that if I get close enough, I could see through the blur. Hoping I could see his face.

But I could only hear the sound of him crying.

  

I ran into the bathroom and splashed my face with water profusely, groaning from the cumbersome anxiety sitting like an anvil on my back.

"You okay, man?" I heard Jonathan ask from behind, pushing the door open with his metal crutch.

"No, I'm not okay," I responded without looking, grabbing a paper towel from the dispenser and pressing it to my damp fur. "I'm fucking terrified."

"Why are you terrified?"

"Why do you think, Jonathan?" I huffed, throwing the paper towel into the trash. "I ruined his life!"

"You didn't ruin Sky's life‚Äî"

"Do you know what this does to a person? To be assaulted and violently forced into doing things you don't want to do?" I snapped, facing Jonathan. "He already went through this once and I put him through it again! I forced him to go to that game after I promised him that I would be his protector!" My face began to go red. I sank my head down in shame. "For all we know, maybe I'm the rapist. I can't face him after what I've done... He probably hates me."

I scratched my head furiously and looked out the bathroom window. I started to hyperventilate, clutching the ledge of the wall, digging my claws into the stone.

"He's fragile... He... He was already so broken..." I whimpered, squeezing my eyes shut. "And I broke him even more."

Jonathan placed his paw on my shoulder.

He made the decision not to say anything as I let my emotions run free.

It was the right decision.

8:00.

Thompson had left to grab Skyler some breakfast as Olympia waited outside.

She allowed us to see him.

The door stood in front of the four of us, me in the lead.

_I don't know if I can do this._

"He's not going to hate you," Claire told me as she patted me on the back. "Let's just go inside, okay?"

I took a deep breath. I placed my paw on the handle. I turned it. I heard it click and creak open.

I opened the door to see Skyler, sitting up from his bed, startled.

Our eyes met.

Almost immediately, all my negative thoughts went away.

Seeing that beautiful vibrant blue cat with pink stripes overjoyed me. It's already been so long since I talked to him last, I just remembered how much I missed him.

Becca closed the door behind her as we all filed in.

"Hey, Sky." I smiled, approaching him slowly as not to freak him out.

"Hi, Charlie." He smiled back.

I sat in the seat closest to him. There was a bandage around his nose and one around his head. He wore a hospital gown and his lower half was covered by the bedsheets. Around his wrist wore a tag and a tube leading to the IV bag in the corner.

"Hi, Sky." Jonathan, Claire, and Becca all said out of unison.

"Hey, guys," Sky responded, taking in the view of all of us. The Breakfast Club, with the new addition of Becca, back together again.

"How are you, Sky?" Claire wondered.

"Oh, you know," He muttered, looking at his feet. "It's better if I don't talk about it."

He seemed uncomfortable.

"Are you cold?" I asked, placing my paw gently on his back.

He flinched when I touched him, backing away from my hand. "I'm fine."

The room went quiet.

"Jonathan, are you okay?" Sky broke the silence, looking at his cast with concern.

"Oh, it's nothing, Sky," Jonathan spoke.

"I'm sorry I left the game... Did you win?"

"N... No..."

"Oh, I'm sorry about that,"

"Seriously, it's no big deal..."

"What's gonna happen to you?" Becca queried.

Sky seemed troubled by the question.

"I dunno..." He slurred, fidgeting with his whiskers. "I still want to go to school and have an education and stuff, but... my parents want me to take a break... I'm gonna need to find somewhere else to stay, anyway..."

_What?_

"You're not coming back to the apartment?" I worried, sitting up in my chair.

"How could I, Charlie?" Sky faced me. "I can't go back there."

_What..? I... No..._

_He can't leave, can he?_

"Do you have any idea where you're going to live?" Claire added.

"I can't stay at home, it'd be too far away from campus." Sky answered.

"I'd offer you'd stay my place, but my apartment's maximum occupancy is one tenant." Claire scoffed.

"You can stay at my place, Sky," Becca suggested.

"No, I... I can't do that." Sky stuttered.

"Please, be my guest. I'm totally fine with it."

"I can't just suddenly move in‚Äî"

"Seriously, I have a whole guest room waiting with your name on it!" Becca beamed.

"Are you sure, Becca?"

"Of course‚Äî"

"But... But, what about your belongings and artwork and stuff?" I interrupted.

Sky looked back at me. Jonathan, Claire, and Becca did the same.

"Well... Hopefully, my parents will collect them." Sky told me.

The tone of his voice seemed saddened. He didn't want this to come up.

"But... But, what about..."

I began to lose my voice. I felt small, my friends staring me down. I kept repeating myself. Starting a sentence and not knowing where it would go. I didn't know what to say.

I didn't want him to leave.

"But... But... Sky..."

"Hey, guys? Can you give me and Charlie a moment, please?" Sky requested.

They nodded immediately and tried their best to leave the room quietly.

The second the door closed, submerging us into a deathly quiet, Sky took a deep breath.

_What is he going to say to me?_

_That sigh can't mean anything good._

"Charlie..." He began. My eyes turned to the floor. "You... You've been so good to me these past few months... I don't think I've ever had this much fun with another person in my life." He chuckled, smiling at the wall. "You're such a sweet and wholesome guy... I don't want to ruin that..."

"Sky..."

"Charlie..."

"Are you breaking up with me?"

  

We never looked into each other's eyes. Ever since the others left the room, there was a thick coldness in the atmosphere, not of the temperature, but of the space between the two of us. It was like ice. We never looked into each other's eyes. We didn't want to because we knew what was coming.

"Charlie..." Sky attempted to explain. "This thing... This feeling... It will eat away at us."

"Sky, wait. Before you continue, just wait..." I shivered, shifting closer, placing my paws on the bed.

"I can't, Charlie. If we were to go on, you know it would be hopeless."

"I don't. I don't know that. You don't know it either."

I finally looked at him. He wasn't looking back.

"I do know. I know what it's like to be tortured by a thought in the back of your head. Ever since that man did those things to me in that alleyway, I was tormented and harrowed for years by my own mind... and it made life worse for everyone else around me. I shut people who tried to help me away. I shut my family away. I locked myself within indestructible walls with spikes on the outside that no one could ever break down. I hurt people. I torture them. I don't want to torture you."

"You are not going to torture me‚Äî"

"I wish I could believe you, Charlie," He said, his eyes beginning to water. "But I've been through it far too many times to deny it. If we remain the way we are, it will tear us apart."

"No, Sky‚Äî"

"It will. I know it will." Sky whimpered, now looking straight at me. His gorgeous sunset-pink eyes are too sweet to exude such sadness. "It's happening now. It's better if I just rip off the band-aid. If I leave it on, it will rot and crumble. I can't do that to you, you don't deserve to undergo something like this‚Äî"

"Sky, I swear to you, if we stay together I will do everything in my power to break down these walls of yours," I promised, grabbing his paw and rubbing it softly. Sky began to shook his head, tears falling from his cheeks. "Just let me in. Please."

"I can't." Sky cried, wiping the tears from his eyes. I began to kiss his paw.

"I know you can, just let me in, kitten."  

_What am I doing?_

_He said he can't._

_Why am I still pushing?_

"Charlie!" Skyler began to howl with sorrow. "Please! Please don't make me do this."

_I'm overwhelming him. I__'m pushing him._ _I'm doing it again._

"Sky..." I gasped for air, clenching his paw lightly. I didn't want to lose the feeling of his fur. "We can get through this, I can help you."

"You can't!" Sky yelled.

"Not if you let me." I pleaded.

"Charlie, stop!"

"Skyler."

"What are you doing?" Sky questioned, pushing away from me in the bed. "Why are you doing this?"

"What do you mean?"

"Why do you insist on our relationship so much? You told me, you _told_ me that this wasn't going to be a serious relationship!"

"Sky, I've gained feelings for you unlike any other‚Äî"

"I told you I was afraid of this! Of a breakup that would ruin a friendship, I told you that I didn't want to ruin what we had!"

"This won't ruin anything! We'll just go back to the way we were before Thanksgiving night‚Äî"  

"You promised me! You promised me this wouldn't be a real relationship! You promised me it wouldn't affect our friendship! _You_ _promised!"_

"Skyler, I didn't know what I was getting into!"

"That's exactly what I warned you about!" Sky argued loudly. I could see the emotion on his face. I was making him feel trapped, scared, weak.

_What am I doing?_

_Fucking stop, Charlie!_

_He felt like a prisoner._

_I was holding him hostage in his own hotel room. I was betraying him. I made him feel safe with my promises of a healthy relationship. I was seducing him. I really am my father's son._

"I thought you knew me." Sky sniffled. "But, you just wanted me. You didn't care about my concerns, you just wanted to date me."

I shut my mouth.

"_He_ was right about you," Skyler whispered, looking back down at the floor. "You don't understand me at all."

  

_Maybe I don't._

_Maybe I never did._

"It's over, Charlie."

  

"It's over."

# 29. DECORATION

### ACT III**:** RECOVERING FRIENDS
\~~~  

## Charlie

### DECEMBER

It's been two weeks. The temperature has finally reached its low points. It's already starting to snow. Sky has been taking time off from school and has been resting at home.

The bedroom has never felt so empty. All of his art has been taken off the walls. The lights, his sketchbooks, and belongings are all gone. The room is only half-decorated now. When I look at the other side, I feel as though I'm looking through a faded mirror. It just isn't the same without him here. It's no good.

I haven't been able to sleep at night.

I miss holding him.

Claire had somehow gotten information from his parents that he had to go to court again, and that his therapy sessions have started back up. He goes every Wednesday at 5:30. His doctors had diagnosed him with PTSD, so there was almost no chance he was coming back to the apartment. Sky also had to undergo a bit of surgery, having to get stitches for his injuries. He also broke his nose. I remember one night in November when I touched the tip of his muzzle to tease him while we were cuddling in his bed. I can't imagine what he's going through now. Maybe he was right to break up with me.

It still hurts. It's selfish for me to think that, but I really do miss him.

He comes back today. Back to CIVA.

It was his own choice.

He's staying at Becca's house. Not the apartment.

\~~~

"You okay, Charlie?" Claire asked as we waited outside of Becca's home in thickly-knitted coats and scarves. I tried my best to spot the blue car, the same one that carried him away when he got out of the hospital.

"I'm fine," I muttered.

"Are you sure? The last time you saw him was when‚Äî"

"I said I'm fine." I interrupted.

I didn't mean to snap at her. I was just nervous.

I was trying my best to put on a happy face in order to give Sky a warm welcome back, but I might've been trying too hard.

_To be honest, I don't know how I should act when he gets here. Should I be friendly or would that be too much for him? Should I try my best to avoid him or will that hurt his feelings? After a breakup, the other occupant and I would always avoid each other for a few weeks. Breakups can be harsh and it takes some time to process them and recover. Even with Cassie._

Skyler was right, dating does affect a friendship.

I don't know how I'll be able to function around him. I'm afraid I'll make a mistake and give him the wrong impression. I may even scare him. This feels like a situation I can't get out of. I can only wait for Sky to arrive to see what my body will decide to do.

Me, Claire, Jonathan, and Becca stood there on the sidewalk as a blue Cadillac came into view down the narrow road of the town. Surprisingly, also joining us were Byron, Dylan, and Milo. They spoke to Jonathan earlier, saying they wanted to apologize.

_Of course, they do._

The tires squealed as the car pulled up on the side of the road. Sky opened the car door from the backseat, smiling at us as he pulled his luggage out from behind him.

_He seems cheery._

_It's good to see him again._  

"Hey, Charlie!" He smiled, walking up and wrapping his arms around me.

_Woah, what is he doing?_

_This feels... strange... considering..._

"It's been a while, hasn't it?" He said, breaking the hug apart.

"Uh, y-yeah." I stuttered.

I didn't know how to feel at the moment.

It was like he was back to normal.

"You okay?" He asked with bright eyes.

"T-Totally."

Sky stared into my eyes for about half a second. Yet, it felt like a minute. A long, awkward, quiet minute. I missed gazing into his beautiful, pink eyes.

"Hi, Claire!" He greeted, turning his attention to the fox. They immediately scooped each other up and hugged profoundly.

"Oh, I missed you!" Claire gushed, squeezing him tightly.

"How have you been?" Sky wondered as they separated.

"Oh, you know, same old, same old."

"How has your love life been treating you?" Sky teased, looking at Jonathan.

"Hey, Sky." Jonathan laughed, giving Sky a side hug.

"How is your ankle? All good?" Sky wondered, looking at the smaller cast on his foot.

"I can finally walk again."  

"Thank god." Sky chuckled.

I forgot the way he used to laugh. His voice would always sound so fragile and soft, but when he laughed, it was tender and warm.

"Hey, Becca." Sky continued, Becca greeting him back. They exchanged more side hugs and small talk until Sky made his way to his former roommates.

"Hi, Sky..." Byron, Dylan, and Milo all said awkwardly.

"Hey, boys," Sky responded, fitting his hands into his pockets.

"We just... we wanted to come..." Byron tried to speak.

"We wanted to apologize." Dylan continued. "For the way Byron and I treated you."

Sky stood there, rubbing his arm in hesitation.

"We were being jerks and we never should've tried to harass someone based solely on their sexual preference," Byron spoke meaningfully.

"It was immature and uncalled for. We should've known better." Dylan added.

_They seem like they mean it. They're being honest._

"God, loosen up," Sky jeered. "I forgive you guys." He sighed, smiling once again.

Both Byron and Dylan smiled slightly back. No one can avoid Skyler Clawfield's infectious glee.

"Hey," Milo spoke up.

Sky, Dylan, and Byron stared at the raccoon awkwardly.

"Hi, Milo." Sky grinned. He missed Milo, too.

"Hey, you ready?" Becca called, tapping Sky on the shoulder.

"Oh, yeah, sorry." Sky flinched.

"No prob, let's go!" Becca cheered.

Sky ran over to the blue Cadillac and grabbed his luggage that he left on the sidewalk. His mom and dad stopped him for a moment a spoke with him privately. None of us could hear what they were whispering to him. Skyler's mother then held him by his shoulder and kissed his forehead. Skyler looked at her, cheerfully.

"Bye, guys!" Sky said to all of us, taking one last small glance at me before following Becca with his luggage in hand.

They disappeared down the sidewalk as his parents took one last look before getting back into the Cadillac and driving off.

_See you later, Sky._

\~~~

## Skyler

Stepping into Becca's brownstone made me feel warm and welcomed.

"Here we are!" Becca squealed, holding her hands out to show off the display.  

In front of me stood the foyer: a hall with a few doorways to other parts of the house with a stairwell in the middle of the hallway leading to upper floors. The house had an earthy, brown, and gray theme. The floor was colored a solid skin tone, the walls had an eggshell texture, the archways were painted rich and smoothly like dark chocolate. There were many potted plants sprouting with life, blessing the atmosphere with a flourishing nature vibe.

"Wow!" I admired, taking in the view. "Quick question: are you rich?" I joked.

"Pfft, please," Becca chuckled. "I designed my home all by myself. I've lived here for about... two years now? I moved out Year 11 in secondary education."

"Oh, how come?"

"Just had to get away from home. I've always had a passionate love for making things look how I wanted them to look. In elementary school, I found out about home decor, so I decided to make it my life-long profession."

"You're really skilled when it comes to decoration." I laughed, taking off my coat.

"I got that, Sky." Becca smiled, pulling the coat off my arms and hanging it on the coat rack in the corner.

"Thank you. And, again, thank you so much for letting me stay here for a bit." I praised, interlocking my paws. "I promise I won't get in your hair while I'm here."

"Please, _jump into_ my hair, it feels good to have some conflict now and then." She shined, heading up the stairs. "Come along, now!"

"Sure... a little conflict..." I muttered under my breath, quiet enough for her not to hear.

As we climbed up the steep wooden stairs, she showed me down the second-floor hallway towards the room where I'd be staying. I couldn't help but look at the paintings and decorations littered over the walls and tables.

"Voila! Your new home!" Becca introduced with jazz hands.

I walked into the room to find a comely, modest guest room; containing an ordinary, queen-sized bed in the middle of the room, two bedside tables adorning modern lamps, two rectangular windows left to the bed, a dresser at the front of the room with multiple drawers, and a big, flat-screen TV on top. Yes, that was entirely one sentence.

"This is the _guest_ room?" I gushed, shocked by how expensive it looked. _I can't believe Becca isn't charging me for this. It looks like a hotel room._

"What'd you reckon I give you, a closet?" She teased. "Isn't it just perfectly splendid?" Becca sparkled, admiring the spectacle of it.

"Wow, Becs, you really went all out with this place." I complimented Becca, who was standing pridefully in the doorway.

"Now, you get settled, I'm gonna go do a few work things. Living room is across the hall, en suite a few doors down, kitchen below us if you need anything." She concluded, patting me on the back.

"Thank you so much."

"Bloody hell, quit saying that!" She giggled as she walked back down the corridor.

\~~~

After unpacking all my things and successfully integrating myself into Becca's guest room, I joined her downstairs during dinner time. She had ordered food from Postmates and took out the contents from the paper bag left on the front steps.

"You're not gonna eat?" I asked, digging into the Italian sub I had requested.

"Oh, I already ate." Becca sighed, sitting down in the chair across from me. The seats were like bar stools. Her dining table had a nice marble finish and the kitchen gave off a white and silver glow.

"And you ordered more food?" I questioned, eyes widening.

"It's no problem, Sky," Becca assured.

"But, you bought a bunch of other stuff..." I said, looking into the paper bag to see a few other sandwiches and bags of chips.

"I'll save that for another time." She suggested, taking the bag and placing it in the fridge.

\~~~

I brushed my teeth and took a shower in the bathroom‚ÄîI mean, _en suite_‚Äînext to the guest room. I put my pajamas on and crawled into the bed. Placing the heavy covers over myself, I couldn't help but notice how warm and cozy it felt.

But, of course, nothing could compare to sleeping with‚Äî

_Wait... Stop, Sky._

_What are you saying?_

_You promised yourself you wouldn't think of him or ever consider getting him back._

_You can handle things on your own._

_You don't need a partner to sort out all your troubles for you._

_You're not a child, you're an adult._

I looked up at the ceiling.

It doesn't look familiar.

I miss staring at those familiar paint cracks.

I sat up briefly, grabbing my headphones from the bedside table. I placed the muffs over my ears and pressed the play button. My usual playlist shuffled and began to sing music into my head as I laid back down into the mattress.

Ever since that man in the alley, I always had trouble sleeping as a teenager. That's when I started using music and white noise, or whatever type of ambient sound, to fall asleep. It distracted me from my thoughts. But recently, I haven't been using music to fall asleep. I was holding onto someone.

Holding on to him.

I turned onto my side, grabbing one of the many white pillows laid out for me. I turned it vertically to my body and wrapped my arms around it. I pressed my face to it, smothering my head into its soft interior.  

It feels good to have something to hold on to. Something to keep you safe.

It feels good to have something to distract you. Something to fill your mind.

_So, why is it so hard to fall asleep right now even though I'm doing both at once?_  
  
  

It's no good.

The music, the pillow.

It's no good.

I've grown so attached to the way he felt, the way he smelled...

It's just not there anymore.

_Why can't I just go to sleep?_  
  
  

Suddenly, my body went cold.

I picked my head up and looked down by my feet.

A frightening image flashed through my mind as I stared intensely at the bed frame.

_The wolf._

_That night._

_Sitting there, limp, unconscious, blood pouring from his head, from the wound I had given him._

I wanted to cry, scream for Becca, but I couldn't. I felt frozen. Like I was that night.

I need to get this image out of my head.

My mother used art therapy to help me whenever I was being troubled by disturbing thoughts. She made me paint out my troubles. Paint it out. Then destroy the canvas.

I wish I still had my sketchpad. I put everything into that tablet, my heart, my soul... Now it's gone. The wolf took it away from me.

I used it to relieve stress. Now it's gone. Now I'm stressed.

_Dammit._

_Have you ever wanted so badly to relieve yourself of an uncomfortable feeling that just won't go away, so you start to lose your mind?_

In a quick motion, I ran out of the room, wanting to get away from the sight.

With my headphones over my head, still playing music, I dashed back downstairs into the kitchen. Swiftly, I grabbed a cup from the cupboard and filled it with tap water. I downed the glass slowly and quickly at the same time.

I placed the glass into the sink and turned around.

For some reason, I didn't see all the open bags of food Becca ordered from earlier, laid out all over the kitchen table, when I first ran in here. It was a mess.

I removed my headphones from my head.  

I could hear someone vomiting in the first-floor bathroom.  
  
  

I tiptoed quickly towards Becca's en suite to notice the light was on on the inside. I peeked through the small, shimmering crack to see Becca, bent over on the floor, throwing up into the toilet.

She was forcing her paw down her own throat.  
  
  

"Becca!" I gasped, opening the door fully.

Her eyes darted back at me flinchingly, terrified for me to see her like this. She couldn't keep her eyes on me for long, as she was violently coughing up the food she just consumed into the toilet.

I ran and fell to her side, placing my paws on her shoulders as she disgorged herself. It was disgusting to watch, disgusting to hear, but I had to help her.

I rubbed my hand against her arched back, asking multiple times if she was okay.

When she finished, I wrapped my arms around her as the back of her head collapsed into my chest.

She began to cry softly as we sat there on the bathroom floor.

\~~~  

"Are you okay?" I asked once again, handing her a water bottle as I sat next to her on the couch in the living room.

A sigh was all I got for a response.

She seemed like a different person. I've always seen her as a confident, bubbly young woman, but now she looks frail and sorrowful. She sat on the couch curled up into a ball, a knitted blanket around her shoulders.

"Rebecca?" I placed my hand on the female wolf's back.

"I'm sorry I scared you," She spoke, her voice raspily. She took a sip from the water.

"I'm sorry _I_ scared you," I chuckled softly, Becca doing the same but quieter.

"It was only your first night here. Now I've put all this bloody weight on you." Becca whimpered.

"I just... I care a lot about you, Becs." I said truthfully. "Why would you do that to yourself?"

No response.

"When did you start doing that to yourself?"

"About a year ago."

"Becca..." I sighed, rubbing my eyes. "You can't do that to yourself, ever. It's unhealthy, physically and mentally."

"I just thought... if I can decorate houses the way I want them to look... maybe I could change my appearance."

"No, Becca," I warned, facing her on the couch. "That doesn't work, and you know that. Hell, it makes things even worse."

"How could it get any worse? I'm skinny now, aren't I?" She muttered under her breath, hoping that I wouldn't hear.

"Not for long. Your body begins to function incorrectly, Becca. Your metabolism begins to slow down, which wastes your energy, which could lead to bodily failures. You can't go on like this‚Äî"

"Why not? I've heard all the lectures, I know what an eating disorder can do to someone." Becca argued, sitting up on the couch.

"Then why do you still do it?" I wondered, placing my paw on her shoulder.

"I don't know."

"There's got to be a reason, Becca."

"I don't know!"

"Is this about something else?"

"Why didn't she love me?!" Becca cried out into the hollow silence of the living room.

We sat there in the spacious emptiness as the cry faded to an echo in our minds.

"What?"

"Why didn't she love me?" Becca began to tear up.

"Becca..."

"Why did she change herself? Was it because of me? Did she not like the look of herself with me, two ugly, dyke lesbians? Is that why she changed her appearance? If she did, why can't I do the same?"

"Is this about _him_?"

"She‚ÄîHe gave up on me... on us... I loved her‚Äîhim... Them..? God, I'm so confused... I don't know how to understand..."

"Becca... he transitioned. He felt that he was always meant to be a certain way, so he became who he truly was. It was his choice."

"But... we worked so well together... I loved him... I loved the way we were..."

"But he didn't."

Becca looked up at me with watery eyes.

"A-And that's not your fault," I quickly carried on. "It wasn't because of the way you two looked together, it wasn't because of your appearance, there was nothing that involved you to affect his views. It was his own desire, and he controls his life. Not you, not anyone else. He wants to be who he wants to be. But that doesn't mean you have to shape yourself into someone you think you _need_ to be."

Becca closed her eyes, letting her tears fall naturally.

"What he thought of you was unrelated." I continued. "You can't change yourself based on what you _believe_ someone else thinks of you. You have to be you, Becca."

"I'm... I'm so selfish..."

"You are not selfish. You're just haunted by the thought that you weren't, or never will be, good, or pretty, or skinny enough to persuade someone to make a sacrifice for you. You may think that you loved him, but you hoping that he wouldn't change himself for himself isn't love. Love is you accepting him for who he is and remaining best friends no matter how bad things get between you two. You need to love him... and you need to love yourself."

Rebecca looked at me. I could see the realization in her expression.

"Just like with Henry, you're not letting yourself be free. You have to be who you are, not who you say you should be."

"How do I do that?" Becca whispered, trembling breathlessly.

"First, reconnect with him," I advised, sitting my back against the ledge. "Then, understand his views. Get to know him better in his new body. Ask him how he wants to be addressed and how you should behave around him. Learn from him. After you've done that, repeat those same steps, but with yourself. Know who you are and meet them. Talk with them. Have a laugh with them. And, when you're ready, become them."

The tips of her muzzle began to rise slowly.

"And, if I'm being honest, you are one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen."

Becca blushed, finally reaching that full smile as she laughed.

"Seriously, if I wasn't into men, I'd totally tap that."

She laughed out loud, her head resting on my shoulder.

We sat there, once again, on the couch, in silence. This time, the silence was peaceful. Hopeful. Rebecca is my friend and vice versa. In the end, nothing really hurts a friendship.

"I love you," Becca slurred, nodding off into sleep.

"I love you, too," I responded, resting my head on hers.

We both drifted into a deep sleep, but as I hovered over the abyss of dreams, I couldn't help but consider following my own advice.

# 30. THE FIRST FIGHT

\~~~

## Charlie

The day after he moved into Becca's house, Sky returned to school. Again, he seemed more cheery than I'd expect him to be. I've always known him to be the fragile, emotional feline that needed repairing and just a little company. I was terrified that he'd come out of this more broken than ever... but he hasn't changed.

Honestly, it looks as though he's gotten better.

But, that still doesn't mean things are okay.

I know, deep down, he's hurting.

I wish I could heal him, but I don't want to break him even more.

His first few days back were as normal as they could be, except for the fact that Sky now stood out more than ever. In Graphic Design, Sky still sat next to me, but people were beginning to stare. Some would turn over their shoulder, some would whisper to others, some would look back and frown. Sometimes, the pity of bystanders is more painful than the harassment. I'm sure Sky could agree. Although he doesn't seem to notice, I know that he's aware of those lurking eyes. He always has been.

He's more fidgety now. Since he lost his sketchpad (and other certain coping mechanisms), his ADHD has gotten the better of him. He's always getting distracted by little things, which is slowing down his conceptual process in school and lowering his GPA little by little. He's also been tired more than usual. I don't think he's been getting enough sleep.

Either that, or he's tired of trying too hard to look like he's okay.

I know he's trying his best not to break.

I wish I could help, but I know that even if I tried, I'd likely be the cause of him breaking.

We only speak to each other occasionally, during our class together and during lunch. And, even then, it feels translucent. All we do is exchange 'Hi's and 'How are you?'s, then we remain quiet for the rest of the period.

Sky comes back to work today. I don't know why I'm always so nervous when I have to interact with him. He's already adjusted back to the regular schedule, maybe I should too. I'm mostly scared I'm going to slip up and do something idiotic. I try my best to make him feel comfortable, but it always ends with me overreacting.

It's 3:00. He walks into Amber's. He speaks to Henri Amber and his wife, they place their paws on his shoulder, apologize, and hand him his apron. Sky glances at me. He joins me behind the counter. We exchange our 'Hi's and 'How are you?'s, until we remain quiet once again. The atmosphere becomes stiff as we stand there in solitude. Thankfully, a customer shows up. Sky takes their order and hands the slip of paper to me. Our paws touch slightly. I get to work preparing the order. He takes the order from my hands and gives it to the customer. Another customer comes in. We repeat. This continues for the time being.

I've noticed that he doesn't draw the little doodles on the cups anymore.

It's now almost the end of our shift. The cafe is empty.

"Hey, Charlie?" Sky calls for me as I wipe down the last of the tables.

"What's up?" I respond.

"Can you help me with these boxes? They need to be moved to the back." He asks, struggling to pick one of them up.

He was always clumsy like that.

"Sure." I chuckled, joining him and grabbing a box.

We tug the boxes through the employees only door and towards the storage area. They're honestly not that heavy, just pretty big. We go back outside to get a few more. We repeat. This continues until all the boxes are moved.

Sky releases a sigh of relief as he lays down the final box.

"That was a workout for you, huh?" I teased, holding my hand up, indicating a high-five.

"Let me guess, for you it was a breeze." He scoffed, connecting his hand with mine.

"You know it." I laughed, Sky did the same.

Sky backed up against the wall, scratching his arm. I sit on the floor near the boxes.

"Hey," Sky spoke, calling my attention. I perked my head and ears up at him. "About... About the breakup‚Äî"

"Sky, we don't have to do this," I assured him, looking at him longingly.

"No, no, I just wanted to clear the air." He clarified, sliding down the iron wall to the floor as well. "I'm sorry about what I said. That you didn't understand me... That was really unfair."

I looked to the floor, fiddling with my claws.

"You did understand me... and you were trying your best _to_ understand me. I shouldn't have snapped at you. I'm sorry."

"Don't worry, Whiskers. You're forgiven," I grinned, standing up. Sky did the same.

"I should've appreciated our time together more. I was just... so fearful of it that I never got the chance to... really experience it. I never bothered to notice all the good things that were happening to me."

Sky looked into my eyes once again before glancing back at the floor.

_I know those eyes. I always have._

_He still... feels things..._

"Well, you only ever know when the glory days were occurring once you've left them." I sighed, placing my paws on my hips.

Sky stares at the top of my head.

Something feels weird about the way he's staring at me.

_He still has feelings for me... I know he does..._

_I know..._

Sky then came up to me and licked his thumb, reaching for my forehead.

"What're you doing?" I flinched, backing up against the wall and grabbing his arm.

"Your fur is standing up." Sky pointed out, breaking free of my light grasp and patting down the hair on my forehead.

I remember when he did this, the night we took a tour of Cloverland.

_What is he trying to say?_

_Is he sending me signals?_

_God, I'm so confused... but... the way he's smiling at me right now... the way he bites his lip..._

_Don't do anything stupid, Charlie._

"There we go," He whispered, brushing his paw across my cheek. I felt his fingers fondle my whiskers.

His eyes connect with mine once more.

_His eyes... it's like... they're screaming. Screaming for me. I can see it, I can feel it..._

_He still wants me..._

_He still... wants me._

He stopped touching my head. He turned around to leave the storage room.

I grabbed his paw before he could escape.

He turned around, looking at me. He seemed confused... but not shocked...

_Maybe he isn't scared of this._

I placed my paw around his cheek.

I pulled him in closer, preparing my lips for a sweet, wholesome kiss... The ones we'd always cherish and adore... The ones that meant deeply to us.

I opened my mouth.

  

He pushed me away.

"Charlie! What are you doing?!" Sky squeaked, stumbling back.

_Fuck._

"I-I'm sorry... I..." I tried to speak.

_Fuck, fuck, fuck, this is terrible._

_I'm terrible._

_I screwed things up again._

"Why... Why did you‚Äî"

"I'm sorry, I thought... I just thought‚Äî"

"You thought what?"

"I... Skyler..."

"You thought you could just kiss me again?"

"Sky‚Äî"

"Reclaim your prize? Win back your damsel in distress?"

"You were giving me... s... signals, I thought‚Äî"

"What, so I'm supposed to give you signals now?"

"You were patting my hair down, like the time we walked around town two months ago!"

"So, what? I thought I was being nice!"

"You were... recalling a memory! A-A romantic one if I recall correctly‚Äî"

"There was nothing romantic about it! We were walking around town as _friends_‚Äîwe were _friends_ back then, we weren't on a date!"

"It felt like one!"

"So, me patting down your fur makes you think a normal meeting between friends is a date?"

"It was seductive..!"

"Are you kidding me, Charlie?"

"It... It was!"

"Why does every friendly, compassionate action between two friends have to be seen as a romantic gesture?!"

"I've grown up with it! My dad did it to random girls on the street every day for years and years!"

"So, you compare every person's actions to your father's‚Äî"

"Shut the fuck up, Sky, you have no idea what it was like to live with that asshole."

"I hope I never do because I would never want to mistake a friendship for a one night stand."

"He believed love was ownership, he objectified women and took advantage of me. You don't think that would affect me in any way?"

"Why does it always have to be love?"

"Would you rather have hatred?"

"I would rather have... equality, or-or fucking justice. Independence, I don't know, anything but love."

"Love is one of the main aspects of living a healthy life, in all ways, not just with partners!"

"Let me guess, I need to love myself?"

"Yes, Skyler! That's the whole point!"

"Spare me."

"I dated you to help coax you out of your shell! I wanted to fix you!"

"Well, look where it's gotten us. At each other's throat in the back of a coffee shop."

"It's normal, people fight all the time, it's life, we have to live through it‚Äî"

"Why does everything have to be a necessity‚Äî"

"After a breakup, it's common that the two people fight a bit, but does that change how they feel for each other?"

"Yes, it completely does! This is what I was telling you from the beginning! Dating changes a friendship, it destroys one, even!"

"Not all the time!"

"It's a risk! You're risking a connection you've worked so hard to build when slipping into a new zone that labels you and the other person as 'more than friends'! I warned you several times that this would happen!"

"Then why did you agree to date me? What, you believed that things would be okay? That we would never have a rocky relationship?"

"Yes, I fucking did, I was ignorant enough to believe you!"

"I was your first boyfriend, how could it not have been rocky? Many times, you bawled right in front of me and I comforted you‚Äî"

"Thanks so much for your recognition."

"Don't you understand? We come from shitty backgrounds and we have shitty ideas lingering in our minds, but together, we can build on one another." I grabbed his hands. "We can form a healthy relationship, I know we can."

"Charlie..." Sky was beginning to tear up.

"If you just let me love you, please, just let me love you fully and completely and I promise you, you will not regret it."

"I can't!" Sky whimpered.

"For the first time in my whole life, I can see a future."

"Charlie, no!"

"No, wait, listen, not for us! I can see a future for you! You're so broken, if you would just let me fix you‚Äî"

"This is your problem! You don't take no for an answer! You're just like _him!_ And it's the same for all alpha-dominant males, you're manipulative, you hurt people, you take advantage of their emotions!"

"I'm not trying to hurt you."  

"You already are! Mentally and physically!"

I noticed that I was squeezing his paws too tightly. I let go.

"Why can't we just accept that we're done and move on?" Skyler continued.

"The problem is that you're moving on too quickly!"

"What are you talking about?"

"No relationship can just go back to being friends immediately,"

"Why not?"

"It's... confusing, it's strange, it's hurtful‚Äî"

"Why can't separated couples just avoid the hurt and go back to being friends? Why does there have to be hurt? Why does love have to hurt?"

"It's just how it is, Sky, nothing can change that. Love is beautiful, but also painful, and that's what makes it beautiful."

"I don't want to hurt anymore. I just want to be happy."

"You can't be happy without any hurt, Skyler."

"Why?"

"It's life. It's how us, animals, live and function."

"I don't want to live that way, I'm scared! I'm scared to hurt even more than I already have!"

"I know it's scary, but it's inevitable. But, do you want to know the best part? You don't have to hurt alone. You can go through all that pain with people by your side."

"I only hurt the people who are by my side. I torture them. I'm torturing you."

"Again, Sky, you aren't torturing anyone. You're living."

"And in return, we torture each other. We torture each and every person alive until we die, and then life goes on without us."

"Skyler..."

_I was all out of words._

_I don't think I've ever spoken so much in my life._

_I was so focused on my speech that I didn't even notice how much Sky was crying._

_I really was hurting him..._

_I was hurting him in a really bad way. I was forcing the hurt upon him other than letting it come naturally._

_I can't force life upon him, life is supposed to be lived, not fed to you with a spoon._

Sky's arms were wrapped around himself. He was breathing erratically and his tears were drenching his fur.

_This is our first fight. Our first, real fight._

_It's fucking terrifying._

"Charlie... it truly pains me to say this, but we cannot be together." Sky shivered breathlessly.

He turns his back to me. I look down at my shoes.

"The world doesn't want us to be together. It keeps trying to fight back whenever we have something somewhat good. We can't be what you want us to be. Maybe we shouldn't even be friends." He spoke.

"Do you really believe that or is that what you think you should be saying?"

Sky didn't respond.

"When it comes to our relationship, you always blame the inconsistencies on something else. Whether it's me, whether it's you, whether it's us, whether it's the world, whether it's life... But, you always fail to mention what really matters."

"What's that?"

"Love, Sky. You only ever reject it. You never let it in."

Sky faced the doorway.

"I have a therapy session, I have to go."

# 31. I LOVE YOU

\~~~

## Skyler

My therapist gave me a stress ball.

I mean, it's better than tugging on my whiskers all day long.

I left the health clinic, bouncing the ball up and down from my hand to the concrete. Did I tell my therapist that I just got into a major fight with my ex? No, I didn't.

It's too much to handle. I've never had such a heated argument with anyone, ever. I hated every bit of it. I was stepping out of my comfort zone and it felt unsafe for me to unleash my emotions with such charged words. And now, I feel so icky inside.

I don't know how I'll ever approach Charlie now.

_God, I never would've felt like this if I hadn't dated him in the first place._

I walked down the sidewalk towards the bus stop to take me back to Becca's place. I tossed the ball to the floor, repeatedly catching it as it bounced on the hard cement.

"Crap," I muttered as I failed to retrieve it.

I kneeled down to try and pick it back up, but it kept rolling away. It began to tumble into the patches of snow, collecting tiny snowflakes around the edges.

Before I could take it, another paw showed up in my vision and snatched it up from the ground.

I stood straight up to see Jonathan standing in front of me.

"Hey, Sky," He greeted, tossing the damp ball back to me.

"Hi, Jonathan." I returned. I didn't expect to see him here. "How are you?"

"All good. Where were you coming from?"

"Therapy lesson..." I hesitated.

"Oh." Jonathan winced, his hands in his pockets.

"Yeah," I tried my best to laugh it off.

"I'm going to Claire's, actually."

"Oh, cool." I nodded, trying to fill the awkward silence. "I'm headed to the bus stop."

"Can I walk with you?" Jonathan asked.

"Be my guest."

We began to stroll down the street which was thinly covered with snow. I could see my breath rise from my mouth in a puff of smoke. I always loved it when that happened.

_Winter is my favorite season, why do I have to be such a downer at this time? I should be happy. Christmas is the best holiday ever and I get to spend it at home with my favorite people. Mom, Dad, Cal..._

"So, how are you and Charlie? All good?"

I was caught off guard by the question.

"Yeah," I answered. "We're just friends now."

"Hm," He sighed, looking out across the landscape. Something was on his mind, I could tell. "Did he ever tell you that he had a crush on me in middle school?"

"Really?" I gasped, my eyes widening at Jonathan.

"Heh, yeah," He chuckled. "He was going through a weird phase." Jonathan saw me look away, blushing. "I'm joking."

"Wow, that's... definitely something..." I smirked, looking back at the tall lion. He was staring at the ground.

_Wait..._

"Wait... You're not the guy he kissed freshman year, are you?"

"Guilty."

"Seriously? You?" I laughed.

"Yep." He laughed in return.

"Woah."

I tried my best to process the thought of them kissing. This was shocking new information.

"Yeah, we had, like, a whole fight about it. We actually stopped being friends for a little bit." Jonathan exhaled slowly, as if he were ashamed of himself. "Not gonna lie, I was... I was a little homophobic back then."

"Oh." My head rolled back down to the concrete.

"I'm straight, by the way. I was just high on something when it happened."

"You did drugs freshman year?"

"Yeah, I dealt with a lot of bad shit back then," Jonathan recalled, taking a deep breath. I could tell he was about to share something uncomfortable. "I was scared about growing up. I thought I'd be too weak when I got out of high school, so I thought, 'Hey, what if I just get a jump start on being an adult? So I can prepare myself for the future?' Henceforth, I smoked, I drank, I got high. The whole time I thought I was becoming stronger when really I was just getting dumber. I thought it was good for me, but deep down I knew it wasn't. I hated myself for it, but somehow it got me popular, which I didn't even understand‚ÄîI... I was known as the lion who got his mane way too early."

I stared at him as he spoke, disturbed and saddened.

This poor guy.

"After talking to some people, I... I decided I needed to change. I wanted to be a better person, but I didn't know where to start... Until my friends started getting picked on and I had to stand in." Jonathan smiled, looking at me through the corner of his eyes.

"So, that's why you stood up against Byron and Dylan." I realized.

Jonathan suddenly stopped in his tracks, causing me to stop too. We faced each other on the damp sidewalk.

"I'm so sorry, Skyler. For everything that happened to you."  

"Oh, don't worry about it, alright?"

Jonathan opened his arms, welcoming me into a hug. Graciously, I took it.

We wrapped our arms around each other. Somehow, even in this freezing cold weather, everything was starting to feel warmer.

"I gotta go," Jonathan called, breaking up the hug. "But... just because you believe something isn't good for you, it doesn't mean you should avoid it."

"Hm?"

"Charlie," Jonathan spoke.

I shifted awkwardly, dropping my eyes back down to the concrete.

"It seemed like you really liked him." He continued, meaningfully. "I could tell he really liked you. Like, _really_ liked you. More than anyone he's liked before. More than Cassie. Trust me, six years of friendship doesn't prove me wrong." He chuckled.

I looked back up at him, conflicted.

"And if you still like him, you should, you know, go after him," Jonathan suggested. "I know you're telling yourself that this break is good for you, but deep down I know that's not what you want. You focus on the negatives, Sky. Why not look at the positives? Think of all the good things he's done for you. If you really think you two have a chance, go for it. Before it's too late."

I didn't know what to say.

"See you, Sky." Jonathan smiled, leaving me lost on the street.

I couldn't speak. I wanted to argue with him, but, for some reason... I couldn't.

I couldn't say no.

I just stood there.  
  
  

_Because he was right._

_Charlie... was right._

_Love does matter. In every single way._

\~~~

I ran down the streets of Cloverland on the brink of a nervous breakdown.

_Love does matter._

_I let Charlie go..._

_He was a good person... He cared about me... More than I could ever care about myself._

_The thought of us separating for good was killing me._

_I need to find him before it's too late._

_What if he's already moved on? What if he's completely gone from my life and it's all my fault?_

_I should have never fought with him._

_I should have never insulted his father._

_I hurt him, so, so badly. I don't know what it'll take to repair that._

_Although, it's like what Charlie said._

_We can build on each other._

_We're both broken people._

_But, we can repair each other._

_Because of love._

_It may hurt to welcome yourself into it, but... that's the point, isn't it?_

_What's life without a little hurt?_

_You can't be happy without the hurt._

_You can't be happy without the hurt..._  

I raced down the streets of campus.

I scanned my surroundings for familiar sidewalks.

I followed them.

I ran down the sidewalk, scanning all the houses on each side of the street.

I turned my head to the left. There it was. The old apartment.

I raced up the stairwell and was halted by the front doors. I rang the doorbell.

_God, I wish I still had my keys._

I rapped my fist on the furnished wood.

"Charlie?" I called, waiting for an answer.

_Am I too late? Does he not want to see me?_

The door opened for me.

Milo was standing in the doorway with a cookie in his right hand.

"Hey?" He said.

"Hi, Milo," I responded. "Do you know where Charlie is?"

"Sky?" I heard a voice come from behind me.

Spontaneously, I turned around to see Charlie, behind me, on the steps with his keys out.

"You okay?" He asked, walking up to me.

_Even after our huge fight, he still worries about me._

I couldn't speak. I didn't know how to tell him what I wanted to tell him.

I couldn't just suddenly kiss him on the porch of the apartment I moved out of. It would be confusing and uncomfortably abrupt. He deserves an explanation. He deserves so much more than what I've been giving him.

"What's wrong?" He continued to ask, placing his backpack down to approach me.

I couldn't help but not tilt my eyebrows. I bit my lip. He must think I'm about to cry by the expression on my face.

"Come with me? Please?" I requested, looking into his deep, hazel eyes.

"Where... Where are we going?"

"Just come?"

"I... Okay..."

I walked past him, down the steps, praying that he'd follow.

I could hear him come after me.

He trusts me. He always trusts me.

\~~~

"What are we doing here?" Charlie asked.

I took him back to Amber's, but we didn't go inside the coffee shop. Instead, we entered the park.

Charlie and I wandered around a little bit. With the sound of snow crunching beneath our boots filling the air, Charlie decided not to ask any further questions. He trusted that I knew what I was doing.

I looked up at the rock.

The memory of the night we had our first real interaction flashed through my mind.

_Is it weird to say that it felt like ages ago? Like I was younger? That I've grown? We were sitting there, on the rock, having no clue as to where this friendship was going. We had no idea._

Charlie was staring at it too.

Could he be thinking the same thing I was?

I decided to part from him while he was distracted by the view of the rock.

I bent over and scooped up a small amount of snow off the ground, mushing it into the shape of a sphere.

He was still distracted.  
  
  

Instinctively, I chucked the snowball at Charlie.

_Headshot._

"Ow!" Charlie yelped, placing his paw to the side of his head.

The snowball had exploded into smithereens, the fragments of frozen water covering his face, filling his ear, possibly dripping down his neck and into his clothing. That must not feel good at all. I immediately began to giggle, covering my mouth with my paw.

"What was that for?" Charlie whined, rubbing the remaining particles of snow off his already damp fur and winter coat.

"You just seemed so... distracted," I teased.

"Oh, bitch." Charlie scoffed, bending over and grabbing a handful of snow.

"Oh, no," I muttered to myself, backing up slowly.

"Mhm." He chuckled, compressing the frozen rain into a larger sphere.

I suddenly remembered how much stronger Charlie is than me.

"Charlie, I was joking!" I shivered, trying my best to get as far away from him as possible.

"Sure, you were." He spoke intimidatingly, approaching me slowly.

"Charlie, I'm sorry!" I chuckled in fear.

"You're fucking dead, Whiskers!" He shouted, booking it towards me with his arm pulled back behind his shoulder.

I shrieked, running in the opposite direction as Charlie chased after me.

Just like a baseball pitcher, Charlie threw the snowball through the air. It rode the wind like an airplane, striking me in the back. I howled in laughter, collapsing to the wet ground.

And thus, our snowball fight, or should I say, _war_, began.

Clusters of snow flew in and out through the space between us. We fled wildly throughout the entire playground, hurling ice-cold grenades at one another. We sprawled, we ducked, we slipped and fell on the ice. It started to become physical, as we were attacking each other on the grass, drenching our coats and clothing in the wet snow. We may have been freezing cold, but we loved it. Our laughs never dried out. Charlie's tail was wagging uncontrollably.

It was adorable.

We then grew tired, collapsing breathlessly on the icy ground of the park, our faces to the sky. It was very blue for a snowy day like this.

I could hear Charlie gasping softly for air beside me. The sound of his breathing always calmed and relaxed me, no matter what pace it was at.

I tilted my head at Charlie, him doing the same. We stared into each other's eyes romantically for a slow minute.

I sighed, breaking apart our eye contact.

Charlie looked back up at the sky.  
  
  

_This is it._

_I owe him an explanation._

_I just need to think of how I'm going to say it... because there's a lot I need to say to him._

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.

"You... You wanna know something my mom used to say to me all the time?" I began, resting my paws on my chest.

"Sure."

"It... it's cheesy, but... I take a lot of inspiration from it." I didn't want this to be a monologue. I didn't want it to sound rehearsed. I just wanted to be upfront and honest with him.

"Go ahead." I heard him say.

I shifted into a more comfortable position in the snow.

"My mom would always say... that life was like baking a cake." I sighed in embarrassment. God, this already sounds fabricated. "It doesn't have to be a cake, it can be anything, but she used a cake specifically for the metaphor because I was younger and cake was my favorite food."

Charlie chuckled. He probably assumed that I liked sweet things when I was young.

"Basically," I continued. "You have your recipe, right? And you put all the ingredients into a bowl, then you mix it up, pour it into a pan, bake it, decorate it, blah, blah, blah... Then you finish. You look back at what you've created and you think to yourself, 'Wow... I did well.' You taste it. You're only allowed to say it tastes good if you used all the correct ingredients. If you mixed it the right way. If you cooked it at the right temperature. Then, you can look back and say, 'I did this. It tastes good. I did well'. And, finally, of course, you eat it. You engorge yourself in it! You love it... because it's yours. You made it. And you're proud of it."

Charlie turned his head to me.

"Life is like baking a cake in the way that... your decisions, your actions, your... relationships... make up your recipe. You have to have the right amount of everything. You can't have too much... you can't have too little. You need it to mix well together. You need it to take shape and find its true form. You need to decorate it, add every last one of those small details to it so it looks good and admirable. When you're done, you can look back on your life and think to yourself... 'I did well. I did this.' When you're done, you... you live through it. One last time before it's over. You... love it. Because it's yours. No one else's. You made this cake, you made this life all by yourself. You put all your work into it. You made sure it was the best it could possibly be."

I turned my head to Charlie.

Our eyes connected once again.

"All my life..." I whispered, tears forming in my eyes. "I thought that keeping to myself was the answer. That my loneliness has been my safe spot. I believed that if I just avoided people, avoided connecting to people, avoided life... nothing bad would ever touch me. Ever. But... nothing good did either. Now, I see that hiding in my own bubble was slowly killing me. I never got the chance to live. But, that was until you waltzed your way into my life."

We both gasped with suppressed laughter.

"Thanks to you, I got that chance. But... I threw it all away. I threw it all away because I believed, so passionately, that it wasn't good for me. That it wasn't good to open up to others and instead, close myself off. But, hiding? Hiding from life? It wasn't good at all. If I want to look back at my life and feel complete... whole... proud of myself for placing all my heart and soul into it... I need to make a change. I need to start living life. I need to start with something."

For the final time, I locked my eyes back onto Charlie. My favorite fluffy, white, adorable husky.

"I need to start with you."

I slid in closer to his body.

"Charlie Cooperton..." I proclaimed, holding his paws gently in mine. "I cannot thank you enough for the life you've given me these past few months. You've opened my heart and my mind and filled it with so much joy and compassion. I don't think I'll ever be able to repay you... but I can say this."

I squeezed his paws tenderly.

"I love you, Charlie," I confessed. "And before you say it back, I need you to understand a few things. As you know, I'm a lot to handle."

We both chuckled breathlessly.

"I'm an extremely vulnerable person with an extremely sensitive fragility. Sometimes the smallest things can cause me to have a breakdown. I'm erratic, I'm confusing... It would be hell to look after me. I just need you to know that it takes a lot to love me back. Every member of my family knows it... You know it... Just, please, understand what you're getting into when you decide to love me. Because it's hard, even for me, to love myself."

I closed my eyes, not knowing what he was going to say.

"I love you, Skyler." I heard his voice declare. "I don't care how terrible things may get, I love you. And I always will love you. Even if I may dislike you at some points, I could never hate you. I'm always going to be there for you, whether you like it or not. I'm always going to try my best to heal you when you feel the most broken. I'm always going to be looking after you, hoping you're okay. I'm always going to be the friendly voice you hear every day to calm your nerves. I'm always going to be the hand on your shoulder when you are afraid or anxious. I'm always going to be the thing you hold on to, to soothe you to sleep, and the thing you wake up to, to motivate you for the day. I'm always going to be yours, no matter what. I love you, Sky, and there's nothing you can do to change that."

Tears began to stream down my cheeks.

Urgently, I shoved my face into his chest, wrapping my arms around his torso, smothering myself into his warm and loving fur. I cried profusely, never wanting his body to leave mine.

I've never felt like this before. I've never felt so in love with someone that I never wanted to let them go.

Charlie tucked me in deeper, solidifying our embrace.

"Can I kiss you again?" Charlie asked politely into my ear.

"Be gentle," I whispered back.

Charlie placed his paws tamely on my jawline, inching his muzzle closer to mine.

At long last, our lips connected.

I missed the way his lips felt. I missed the way he tasted.

I missed this so much.

I missed Charlie so much.

# 32. HOME SWEET HOME

\~~~

## Charlie

Although It's been a few days since Sky and I reconciled, Sky has already made the decision to move back into our apartment. I tried to warn him about jumping into things too quickly, but he told me that he was committed to turning his life around.

Hell, if he's happy, I'm happy.

The only thing that worried Sky about coming back to the apartment was overcoming his PTSD.

He would have to return to the place where it all went wrong, where he was abused, tortured, violated, and betrayed. I was scared for him, scared that he'd have a panic attack or some sort of episode that would put him back in the hospital. I might've been more worried about Sky than Sky himself, though, because he accepted the challenge with little hesitation.

\~~~

Skyler stood there on the sidewalk, among his parents, Claire, and Becca. He looked up at the apartment ahead with fear in his eyes. His mom and dad held his luggage and belongings in their hands.

"You ready, Sky?" I asked attentively.

"Huh?" He responded, turning his head to me. "Oh, yes‚Äîyeah, I'm ready."

"Do you want us to come in with you?" Sky's mother placed her paw on his shoulder.

"I can do it on my own." Sky stated, though I could hear the doubt in his voice.

"He made it up to the front door last week, no problem," I told his parents. "I'm sure he can make it to the bedroom." I smiled at him.

Sky took a shaky deep breath and returned the anxious smile back to me.

"You can do this, Sky," Claire spoke up.

"We know you can," Becca added.

Sky glanced at them, feeling relief.

Sky, Olympia, and Thompson huddled up and uttered a silent prayer.

"May God give you strength." I had heard Olympia whisper.

Sky turned around and faced the stairwell.

"Let's go," I beckoned, placing my foot on the first step.

Sky took a deep breath and joined me in ascending the stairs.

The closer we got to the house, the bigger it got. The more it towered over Sky, the more frightened he became.

We got up to the front door. Jonathan was standing there, opening it for the two of us. I entered the house first, Sky stopping at the entrance.

"You okay?" I wondered, looking back at him.

Sky didn't respond.

I held my hand out to him. Thankfully, he took it. I guided him inside as Jonathan closed the door behind us.

Sky examined the living room as if it were his first time here. Dylan, Byron, and Milo all stood watching in the corner by the couch. Sky's eyes suddenly locked onto a spot on the floor. I don't know the significance of that spot, but it must have been crucial to what had happened that night. Sky, or anyone really, never told me the whole story of what had occurred.

"Sky? What's wrong?" I asked, approaching him slowly.

His breathing was beginning to become erratic. I placed my right arm around him and held him close.

"You don't have to do this if you don't want to," I assured him.

Sky began to squeeze my left shoulder with his right hand tightly.

"I... I..." He tried to speak. "Can we go up together?"

"Of course we can, Skyler."

Sky in my arms, we crept up on the staircase that led to the bedroom.

We placed our feet on each step, one at a time.

Though I went fairly slow for Sky, I could see that he was still having trouble catching up. He was staring at certain spots of the wood on the staircase, like the pillar in which his head had collided with. That was the only thing I found out about, due to the blood that was left there at the crime scene.

I grabbed Sky's hand and squeezed it softly, Sky clenching it firmly.

Even the few steps of the small staircase felt enough like a harsh, treacherous journey. I was trying my best to put myself in Skyler's shoes, to understand how he was feeling about the situation and how he was seeing it. Then, maybe I could calm his nerves even more.

We reached the second floor. Down the hall was the bedroom.

Sky started to breathe at an abnormal and rapid rate.

"Hey, hey!" I whined as Sky's whole body began to shake. I rubbed my paw gently up and down his arm. "You're gonna be all right. I'm gonna be right here, by your side. I'm never gonna leave you, okay?"

"Do you promise?" Sky shivered, tears in his eyes.

"I promise, Sky," I said, kissing his forehead. "Here, take your shoes off."

I bent over and helped him remove his boots, allowing his feet to sink into the soft carpet below. I did the same. His feet were miniature, unlike mine.

"Better?" I asked, Sky nodding his head.

Wrapping my arms back around Sky, we headed towards the door.

Step by step, the hallway seemed to grow longer. The bedroom seemed to be farther. The closer we got, the farther the door moved away from us. It felt as though Sky and I were stuck in a frozen moment of time, a neverending hallway, and that we would never reach the bedroom.

"I'm scared, Charlie..." I heard Sky mutter under his breath.

"Of what, sweetheart?"

"Of what I'll see when we get inside."

"You'll see a room, only half decorated, with a side that seems like it's missing a certain something. Something like you."

"I don't want to go back to that night."

"You won't."

"How do you know my mind won't take me there?"

"If it does, I'll go back through it with you."

Sky nodded again, wiping his eyes.

We stopped at the door.

"I'm gonna open it, okay?" I told him, placing my paw on the handle. He nodded his head, allowing me to turn it.

The door creaked open and I carried Sky inside, closing it behind me. Sky's breathing began to slow as he stared at the empty side of the room where he used to sleep. All that was there was an empty desk, a bed frame, and a mattress with no sheets or blankets on it.

We stood there, frozen solid. I would only advance if Sky was comfortable with advancing. I looked at him, trying to understand what was going through his mind. He was just staring at the barren mattress. I loosened my grip over him.

He began to walk out of my arms, approaching the mattress slowly and carefully.

"Sky?" I called, but he didn't turn around.

He sat on the edge of the mattress, his breathing starting to become shaky again. His eyes began to water and turn the color red.

"Sky?" I called again.

A tear fell from his cheek. He began to gasp for air, his breathing now spasmodic and unstable. He clutched the edges of the mattress with his paws, his claws beginning to protrude into the material. His body was now twitching violently. He closed his eyes, letting the tears spill out. He leaned over and tried to catch his breath, exuding a painful wail.

"Sky, what's wrong?" I worried, trying to place my paws on his shoulders.

Sky immediately stood up and collapsed into me, wrapping his arms around my body. I didn't expect the sudden tackle, causing me to stumble backward into the wall by the door. Sky cried into my chest, choking on his own whimpers.

"Hey! Hey! What happened?!" I yelped, rubbing my paws into his back.

"I... I messed up, Charlie," I heard him whimper as he clasped my body tighter. "I messed up."

"What do you mean, Skyler?" I asked, petting his head gently.

"I kissed him..." Sky confessed in a whisper of hopelessness. "I kissed him."

I didn't know how to react to his confession, but I already knew that I didn't care. What's done is done. I didn't want to make this about me. I let him explain, even though I didn't need him to. It wouldn't make me love him any less.

"I thought he was you..." Skyler wept, looking at the floor. "He drugged me, I thought he was you, I swear..."

"Sky..."

"I betrayed you."

"What? No!" I held Sky and gripped him by his shoulders. I couldn't let him be haunted by this thought. It wasn't his fault. "You didn't betray me, Skyler! It wasn't your fault."

"But‚Äî"

"No buts, it wasn't your fault, and that's final." I declared, staring strongly into his eyes. "_He_ did this to you. I will not let you blame yourself for his actions, I don't fucking allow it." I may have come off as angry with him, but I wasn't in the slightest. "Skyler, I love you, but you need to stop throwing yourself into the fire. I'm sick of it, and you deserve so much better. You deserve to be happy."

I wiped Sky's tears away with my thumbs, gently caressing the sides of his head.

"It's like you said," I recalled. "If you want to look back on your life and feel proud, then... you have to make a change."

"Okay." I heard him whisper in the softest of tones.  

Sky put his paws on mine, leaning up and kissing me softly.

We touched our foreheads together.

"Go." I urged him.

Sky turned right back around and began to approach the bed, stronger this time. His fists clenched harder, every step taken felt like a march. I could hear the anger in his breath. He was outraged. He was infuriated.

_That fucking wolf._

Sky sat on the bed once more. He closed his eyes and began to control his breathing. It grew so slow and quiet that I almost thought he hyperventilated.

But, no.

He was calm.

He picked his feet up and lied his head down on the surface of the mattress.

He laid with his back down, his body turned up to the sky.

He placed his paws on his belly and stared at the ceiling.  

Already, I could tell what he was focusing on.

The cracks. The chipping paint. Every small broken piece.

Sky closed his eyes and released one last sigh of relief before going quiet.  
  
  

I waited.

I watched.  
  
  

He's been quiet for a while now.

I kept watching him.

How long has it been? A minute?

An hour?

He looks so still, yet so relaxed.  
  
  

I crept up on him quietly, placing my ear close to his muzzle. Thankfully, I could hear his breath.

"He's asleep." Jonathan's voice echoed from behind me.

"He looks so at peace when he's asleep," I whispered. "I always loved watching him sleep."

"Creep." Jonathan snickered.

I sat there, my chin resting on my paws, watching the fragile kitten nap. He's a beautiful sleeper.

"C'mon," Jonathan whispered, placing his hand on my shoulder. "Let him rest."

I stood up, wrapping my arms around Jonathan, him doing the same.

"He's gonna be okay, Charlie," Jonathan assured. "He's gonna be okay."

Tears began to fall from my eyes.

I really hope he's right.

\~~~

A few hours had passed. Jonathan, Claire, and Becca helped me and Sky's parents bring in his luggage and belongings. While Sky slept, I unzipped his bags and fit his clothes into the drawers. I opened his portfolio and took his art, pinning them to the wall where they used to be on display. I used the polaroid I took the day I moved in as a reference. I wanted everything to be back to normal when he woke up.

It was now 8:30. The sun had set quicker than usual. Of course, it did, it's the third week of December. Sky was still asleep. It was cold in the room, so I grabbed one of the blankets from my bed and tossed it lightly over his body. I took one of my pillows as well, gently lifting his head and placing it underneath.

My sleeping kitten.

I bent over to gently kiss his forehead... until I heard the sound of the door opening. I immediately pulled away and stood back up.

Sky's mother and father filed into the room quietly.

I still didn't have the authority to tell them. I haven't even spoken to Sky about them.

They watched their son sleep soothingly, their eyes lighting up with pleasure. Olympia brushed her paw against his fur, kissing him tenderly on the forehead. Thompson placed his arm around her, allowing Olympia to rest her head onto his shoulders.

\~~~

"Tell him we said goodbye," Olympia sniffled, on the brink of tears, outside of the apartment.

"Don't you want to tell him yourself?" I questioned.

"That's alright," She smiled. "I know he's in good hands."

I couldn't help but blush at that statement.

Olympia then reached into her purse and handed me a medium-sized box that was covered in colorful wrapping paper.

"What's this?" I asked, holding the box in my hands.

"I was gonna give it to Sky when he woke up, but..." Olympia chuckled.

I looked back at her, already knowing what I must do, nodding my head.

"I'll get it to him," I promised.

\~~~

It was 10 PM, and Sky still hadn't woken up. I decided that I'd be able to talk to him again in the morning and that I should let him get the rest he so desperately needed. Claire and Becca had gone home, and Jonathan and the others had gone to sleep. I tucked Sky in one last time before going to sleep myself. I wanted him to feel the most comfortable he's ever felt in his life.

I turned off the light, undressed, and hopped into my bed across the room.

I closed my eyes, knowing that things were going to be okay.

Sky is going to be okay.  
  
  

"Charlie?" I heard a soft, helpless voice whimper.

I opened my eyes and sat up immediately.

"Yeah?" I responded.

"Can... Can you come over here?" He requested with a shy voice as if he were embarrassed to say it.

Instinctively, I came over.

_God, why didn't I just sleep next to him in the first place? Why did I leave him to wake up in that bed alone?_

_I had promised him that I would always be there when he woke up._

_I'm so bad at keeping promises..._

I came to his side, crawling underneath the blanket and into his bed. I tried to give him a tiny bit of space so that he wouldn't feel pressured or claustrophobic. I was afraid he might've felt awkward due to the fact that I was wearing only my boxers, but he seemed perfectly fine with it.

I rested my head to the ceiling, mirroring his position.

It was like the first night we slept together.

We both didn't know what to do or what to say, but what we did know was that we were there for each other. We were beside one another. We were safe.

Silence laid steadily within the walls of our bedroom.

"Charlie?" I heard him whisper again.

"Yes, Sky?"

He didn't respond.

"Skyler?"

"Sorry, I just wanted to hear your voice." He apologized with a faint chuckle. I followed it up with another breathy laugh.

"I'm surprised you woke up when you did," I spoke softly. "You slept all day."

"I don't think I was sleeping..." Sky said as if he didn't want me to hear it.

"Hm?"

"I think I was daydreaming..."

"What were you daydreaming about?"

Again, Sky didn't answer.

Instead, he wrapped his arm across my torso, resting his head back onto my chest. He held onto my fur, tightening his grasp.

"You poor thing." I sighed, kissing his forehead.

Sky began to nuzzle the tip of his nose into my neck.

"Charlie, I'm so terrified."

"What's wrong, lovely?"

"I..." Sky hesitated. "I've never loved someone as much as I do you. I've never been so happy before. I missed this. I missed us, just us, together in this bed."

I held his paw with mine, wrapping my other arm around him, shielding Skyler from the dangers of the dark night.

"I don't want to lose this feeling," Sky continued. "I don't want this feeling to stop. I don't want to lose you, Charlie. I just... I just want to stay here in this bed with you forever."

I didn't want to respond to his truthful confessions with trite, hackneyed sayings. He deserves a real answer. A truth for a truth.

"You're right," I told him. "You're right, Sky. One day... this will stop. All of this. But... that doesn't mean you have to be scared. You shouldn't feel sad because it's over, you should feel happy that it happened. That you didn't waste precious time feeling alone."  
  
  

"I love you, Charlie."

"I love you too, sweetheart."

I burrowed my muzzle into his neck, pulling his body closer to mine. Our limbs began to tangle. Our feet wrapped around one another, interlocking us into an embrace that would last the whole night.

"Welcome home, Skyler."

It was the softest I had ever spoken in my life.

# 33. GHOSTS

\~~~

## Skyler

I don't think I've ever woken up so refreshed in my life. The feeling of Charlie's body against mine provided the warmth and energy I needed to feel clean and stimulated. I had been given a second chance. I have the opportunity to turn my life around.

All thanks to him.

Watching Charlie sleep produced a new feeling. His guard was let down. It felt like I was protecting him, when in reality, he's always the one looking after me. How I wish I could help him with his troubles. I'd be such a good boyfriend if I were willing to carry all his pain.

I am willing.

Usually, he's the one who wakes up first. Unless he's faking it like last time.

I softly tapped his nose. He's not.

Charlie sleeping revealed a new side to him. An innocent, defenseless side. He was like a baby. Beautiful boy. He reminded me of Cal.

He was wearing only his underwear. This was the first time he'd ever actually sleep without his clothes with me. I liked it.

God, I really wish it were a weekday. That way, I could stay in Charlie's arms all day long.

His fur felt silken and delicate to the touch. I just wanted to climb inside his fur and hibernate for the winter. I know it sounds cheesy, but right now, I don't even care anymore. I love this feeling. I love Charlie.

"Ah, you beat me to it," Charlie yawned groggily, as he had just woken up.

"I guess I wear the pants in this relationship," I teased, petting the fur behind his ears. His tail began to wag as Charlie lustrously maneuvered his paws around my waist.

"This was always my favorite part of the day, you know. Waking up to you, knowing that I get to spend the next 24 hours with you... I missed that feeling." Charlie said, looking deeply into my eyes. I wanted to say 'me too' so badly until: "One second," Charlie told me, softly poking the tip of my nose.

He then got out of the bed and quickly retrieved something from his desk. It was a box wrapped in colorful paper.

"What's that?" I wondered as he slid back into the blankets.

"Your mom dropped it off," Charlie informed me, handing me the box.

"What is it?"

"I dunno. Open it."

Like a child on Christmas Day, I excitedly ripped the paper apart to reveal what was inside.

"Oh, wow," Charlie gasped in amazement, looking at the contents.

"An iPhone." I chuckled, holding the package in my hands. The sleek design and shiny overlay made the box seem so new and satisfying. I slid the top off, staring at the expensive-looking phone situated inside.

There was a sticky note on the lid that read, "This will keep you safe. Mom."

"Check that out," Charlie spoke slyly. "Now you can call me whenever we're apart."

"You already know I'm gonna be calling you nonstop, right?"

"You know that I know it."

"Even when we're in the same room."

"Oh, yeah." Charlie laughed, wrapping his arms around my body.

Our muzzles couldn't stay apart any longer. We both connected our lips and began to make out passionately as I dropped the phone on the pillow behind Charlie. I couldn't help but giggle in between kisses. Charlie was once again dominating my emotions. He's so good at doing that. It must be a common trait built into boys like him. How did I ever end up with such a strong, commanding husky like him? They're supposedly a cat's sworn enemy. He was a predator and I was his prey.

Our little morning make-out session felt like a cleansing shower of both purity and sensuality. Our relationship is real now, I acknowledge it to be real.

As desirable as this moment was, of course, it had to be ruined.

The blaring alarm of a cell phone began to sound out, jolting the two of us out of our mouth-to-mouth contact.

"Do you have an alarm set?" I asked him.

"No, do you?" Charlie returned the question.

"I just got it."

"Right."

Charlie turned around and picked his phone up from the carpeted floor. He was getting a call from an unknown number. He immediately shut it off.

"You're not going to take it?" I questioned as Charlie laid back into the bed.

"Hell no." He chuckled. "Now, where were we?"

Our mouths connected once again. As we kissed more firmly, I moved my paws down his back. Charlie began to bite my neck, which hurt at first, but then felt rather pleasing.

But, unfortunately, Charlie's phone rang once again.

"Fuck." Charlie grunted, separating from me and grabbing his phone where he left it.

"You can take it, I don't mind," I suggested.

Charlie shook his head, frantically hugging me once more.

I wrapped my arms back around the husky as he kissed my neck with a craving. I released sighs of ecstasy, which was so unlike me. _I've never been... well... turned on... before._ But Charlie knows his stuff. Am I actually considering losing my virginity to him?

_No... that takes time... I need time before that can happen._

But, I like this. This is good enough. I can handle this.

But, what I can't handle is the fact that Charlie's phone rang once again.

Charlie and I halted our make-out session as it rang, looking at each other with annoyance.

"Take it," I told him with a friendly smile.

"I wanted this morning to be about you."

"Just take the call."

"I love you."

"Yeah, yeah."

Charlie grabbed the phone and answered it.

I turned to my opposing side, facing the wall. I sighed, staring at it intensely. It's been a while since I've woken up to this room.

The sound of Charlie leaving the room ringed in my ears.

I was in the bedroom alone.

Looking around, I noticed parts of the wall that I used to stare at when I used to live here. I sat up, staring at those familiar cracks in the ceiling. My neck aching and my head dizzy, I looked back down at the footboard by my feet.

  

_The image of the wolf bleeding out at the far side of the bed flashed through my mind once again._

_My limbs went rigid. My fur stood on end. I had gotten a sudden and displeasing chill, sending my whole body into shock._

_I tried to call for Charlie, but something was stopping me._

_I was possessed by the thought of the wolf. I was under his haunting spell._

_I thought I was over this. I thought this chapter was finished._

_He's still here._

_How the hell is he still here?_

_I tried so hard to get rid of him._

_But, he'll always be there._

I shrieked. My whole body jerked out of control as I jumped out from under the covers. I shook violently as if my whole body was covered in spiders. The image was crawling under my skin, covering me with webbing. I tried to get it out of my mind, but the thought kept clawing at my nerves.

"Sky?" Charlie worried, rushing back into the room.

He immediately clasped his arms around me, trying to squeeze out all the spiders from under my skin. Trying to squeeze out all the fear and pain.

Again, the feeling of his body was like a holy grail. Suddenly, all that fear went away as I huddled closely into his arms. Charlie was like my EpiPen whenever I had an allergic reaction.

"Hey, are you okay?" He asked frantically.

"Now I am," I groaned, holding him even tighter.

\~~~

I toasted two pieces of bread, handing one of them to Charlie. All he did was spread plain butter on his, while I layered mine with jam and fruit.

"Who was on the phone?" I asked before taking a bite.

"No one," Charlie muttered as he chewed the toast.

He kept looking at the plate, and not at me.

I know that sounds selfish, but it felt unusual, considering he's always staring at me.

_Jesus, that sounded really narcissistic._

"You okay?" I asked him.

"Yup." He responded, nodding to the toast.

"I'm sorry I freaked out on you again." I laughed, taking another bite of my breakfast.

"You're good." He replied, dryly.

Something felt off about him.

_Was it my fault? Did my episode turn him off?_

_He feels so much more different than a few minutes ago..._

\~~~

Charlie and I walked to class without any conversation.

I would believe that we'd be admiring the beautiful, silent tranquility, but something about Charlie's disposition made him feel frustrated.

At a crossroads, Charlie turned abruptly and walked the other way.

"Where are you going?" I called out to him, confused by the action.

"My photography class?" Charlie responded as if I were completely empty-headed.

"Oh, I..." I hesitated. "Okay, see you later."

Charlie waved before turning back around and walking to his class.

_Usually, he would walk me to my class._

_Why am I being so speculative? He's probably just trying to give me space. It has been a while since we walked to school together, and that's mostly my fault. I shouldn't just expect him to be at my side at all times like he's my servant. I'm just being dumb. It's a struggle, merging back into this lifestyle. His lifestyle. Maybe I should be the one giving him space._

_But then, why was he so sexual with me this morning?_

_Jesus, quit overthinking, Sky. Just go to school._

\~~~  

For lunch, I met up with Charlie at a diner. We haven't had our usual breakfast club meeting in a while, which was fine with me, since I got to catch up with my boyfriend. But, instead of us indulging in conversation like a normal couple of friends, Charlie kept staring at his food and played with it. He barely took one bite.

Somehow, we were back to the 'Hi's and 'How are you?'s.

In Graphic Design class, I tried my best to get Charlie's attention, but it seemed as though his mind was somewhere else.

_Maybe I didn't do anything? Maybe he's going through a personal struggle?_

"Seriously, what up?" I confronted him during our usual shift at Amber's, leaning up against the marble counter.

"Huh?"

"You've been acting weird."

"Weird, how?"

"I dunno, I‚Äî" I shrugged, contemplating whether it was truly necessary to be saying this or not. "You, just, seem distant today."

"Oh. Sorry."

"No, you don't have to apologize," I scoffed. "I was just worried."

"Why are you worrying?"

"I-I-I dunno, I, just," I stammered, regretting bringing it up in the first place.

"Hey," Charlie snickered, placing his paw on my arm. "You don't have to worry, alright? I'm fine."

"Yeah, I know, I, just‚ÄîI want you to know that I care about you," I spilled. I didn't mean for this conversation to get so dramatic. "You don't have to be protecting me all the time, I can handle whatever's on your plate, Charlie, you can tell me anything."

"I get that, Sky," Charlie grinned. "I'm all good, I promise."

I nodded, yet still inhabiting the feeling that he's keeping something from me.

"I love you, Kitten." He whispered, kissing my forehead.

"I love you, too." I smiled, hoping that everything will be alright.

"Behind you."

I turned around to see a customer patiently waiting for me to take his order.

"Oh‚Äî"

"Get to it," Charlie said, patting my back.

\~~~

As usual, we cleaned up, locked up, and went home. After a quiet dinner, brushing our teeth, changing, and getting ready for sleep, I sat up in my bed, waiting for Charlie. I was in the middle of a sketch in my notebook. I always felt less flexibility when using pencil and paper, that's why I always used my tablet all the time. But, I broke it, so I guess I'm gonna have to stick to the basics.

Charlie came in after taking a shower, wearing only his boxers. Like last night, I allowed him to sleep with me like that.

"Hey," He greeted, joining me under the covers.

"Hiya," I responded, resting my head on his shoulder.

"How are you adjusting? Back into the apartment, I mean."

"Oh, you know," I sighed, looking around. "It feels strange, but I can handle it."

"Strange? How?"

"Well, for starters," I cleared my throat, sitting back up. "I have this... weird sinking feeling whenever I'm in this bed."

"Really? A sinking feeling?"

"Yeah, like, when you go straight down on a rollercoaster."

"Huh."

"It's not overwhelming or anything, it's just sort of there. I keep taking deep breaths as if I'm gonna run out of air."

"Mhm." Charlie nodded, brushing his paw through the fur on my head.

"What about you?"

"Hm?"

"How have you been adjusting? To me coming back?"

"Well," Charlie scoffed. "I've definitely felt a lot better, considering."

"Considering?"

"What?"

"Considering what?"

"Oh, well, just about everything."

_For some reason, something still felt off about him._

_When he looked into my eyes, I didn't get that same spark I always did when things were better._

_He seemed stressed out. Sad, even._

_But, I shouldn't bring it up. It'll probably annoy him._

"What are you drawing?" He asked, looking at my notebook.

"Pssh, I never know," I murmured with a deep exhale, staring at my sketch. "Usually, I just start a line and see where it takes me."

"Is it selfish to say it kinda looks like me?"

I looked at Charlie. I looked back down at my drawing.

My initial idea was to draw someone, anyone. The fact that it was a white Siberian husky with an overall joyful appearance probably wasn't a coincidence. I had drawn Charlie Cooperton on accident. I guess that just goes to show how much he's on my mind.

"I guess my heart just, kind of, took me in that direction." I smiled, looking back up at him.

"It looks pretty spot on for a sketch that had no end goal." Charlie admired, tapping his finger on my nose, causing me to blush. He then laid a long, meaningful kiss on my forehead. "How much do I love you?" He whispered into my ear, resting his nose on my head.

"A lot?" I whispered back.

"Much more than a lot." He spoke softly, pulling me in closer.

"Charlie Cooperton, you are something else," I chuckled, cuddling into his arms.

"Are you okay, Whiskers?" Charlie asked me.

"What do you mean?"

"After everything that happened, are you okay?"

"I'm holding up, Charlie," I answered. "I'm holding up."

We both began to slide down into the bed. Thankfully, I had installed the sheets and blankets back onto the mattress in advance. Charlie pulled the covers over us as we melted into position together.

"Are you? Holding up?" I returned the question to him.

"Of course, Sky."

"Are you sure you're not just saying that?"

"What do you mean?"  

"You're so protective of me, I'm just worried you're putting my needs over your own."

"Sky..."

"Charlie, I'm serious." I whimpered, brushing his cheeks with my paws. "I'm not weak. I can help."

"I know you're not weak, Sky."

"So, tell me, what's wrong?"  

"Sky, nothing's wrong."

"I can handle anything, Charlie. I can help you, I swear. I can be a good boyfriend."

"You are one."

"Not if this relationship's one-sided. Love goes both ways, you know that."

"Yes, Sky."

"So, let me love you the way you love me."

"I'm tired, Sky," Charlie muttered. "Let's go to sleep, alright? We'll talk about it in the morning."

"Charlie‚Äî"

"Shhh, Sky."

Charlie began to stroke my head gently, which did make me rather sleepy.

"I'll get the light," Charlie told me.

"I got it."

"No, it's fine."

"Charlie."

"I'm closer to it."

In one sneaky movement, he got up from the bed and made his way over to the light switch. He turned it off, swiftly joining me back into bed.

"I hate you." I teased, Charlie welcoming me back into his embrace.

I was incredibly exhausted, and as always, Charlie's warmth relaxed me after the long day. I began to yawn as he cradled me.

"You're adorable, Skyler." He swooned.

"Dammit, I thought I was finally free of that word."

"Keep dreaming, bud."

I missed the way he smelled. I could always tell when he changed his shampoo. His fur was damp, yet clean and nurtured, giving off a cooling sensation. I had no problem holding his bare body. He was my drug, the melatonin I needed to get through the night. Even though I am still worried about Charlie's mental health, I know it's something we'll return to later. For now, Charlie and I can just rest in this solemn state of peace and tranquility, together.

  

Yet, I woke up in the middle of the night to no Charlie.  

I moved my arm around the mattress to see if he had just moved, but no. He was nowhere in the bed. Without him, the mattress felt like an ocean, the blankets like waves, heavy and confining. I began to feel stiff and cumbersome, as if my blood had been weighing me down.

The last time I had this feeling was when I was held down by force by the wolf that fateful night. I felt like I was drowning in the air. My soul was sinking out of my body, I couldn't breathe, I couldn't move.

With every ounce of strength, I pushed my body up from the bed through my arms. I was never good at push-ups. With a few choking grunts and grasps for solidarity, I sat up, rubbing my eyes. It took a while for them to adjust to the dark, empty room.

At the edge of the bed, I saw him again. The wolf.

_He'll never leave._

_No matter how much progress I make, he'll never leave my head._

I felt frozen, once again, with fear and treachery.

"Charlie..?" I whimpered, so low I knew even if he were here, he could not hear my voice at all.

I dragged myself off of the bed, making my way towards the door, and eventually leaving the room. I limped down the hallway, my body still heavy from the image of the bloody wolf.

_Am I dreaming? Where is Charlie?_

Carefully, I tiptoed down the stairwell, clenching the railing for stability. My feet felt weak and fragile as if they could twist right off.

As I got to the main floor, the sound of someone crying softly could be heard, coming from the kitchen.

I stumbled my way over quietly to the source of the sound... only to see Charlie, standing by the kitchen window in the dark, rubbing his eyes as he sobbed faintly.

The sight of Charlie in distress activated my senses, allowing me to take control of my body once again. Instinctively, I marched my way over to Charlie, desperate to assist him.

I don't like it when he's sad.

"Charlie?" I whispered.

Charlie jerked his head over to me, immediately wiping the tears from his eyes. He didn't want me to see him like this.

"Sky, I‚Äî" He gasped.

"Please, don't say another excuse," I whined, joining him by the window. "Just tell me what's wrong. Don't you dare say it's nothing."

"Skyler..."  

"Charlie, please!" I begged. "Please stop pushing me away! I get that you want to take care of me and I get that you don't want to be selfish and make things about you, but I need you to tell me what's wrong." I grabbed his paws, Charlie trying his best to avoid my gaze. "Please, let me take care of you, too."

I could see it in his eyes, there was no way out of this. He needed to come clean. Charlie took a deep breath before confessing what had happened.

"It's my dad..." Charlie hesitated, his posture and attentiveness seemingly deflated. "He... He got arrested."

"Oh, Charlie," I moaned, covering my mouth with my paw after hearing the news.

"I got a call from home... from a friend..."

I tried my best to be there for him as he spoke, tried my best to make him feel comfortable. To let him know that I listened to and validated his thoughts.

"They said that he... he..." Charlie tried to explain, before breaking down into a fatal cry.

"Charlie..." I sighed, wrapping my arms around him. Charlie's head fell into my shoulders, his body slowly collapsing onto mine.

I could tell he was far too overwhelmed with emotions. I know exactly how he feels.

He's sad and helpless.

He just needs someone to hold.

Someone to be there for him.

"Hey, I'm here," I whispered, caressing the back of his head as he wept. "I'm here, Charlie... I know, I'm so sorry..." I didn't know if these words even meant anything to him. "I'm sorry... Shhh..." I didn't even know if they helped. Though I understand his pain, I don't know what's going on in his mind. I just needed him to know that I was there for him. That what he was feeling was right. "It's okay, Charlie... It's okay to cry. It's okay to feel sad, Charlie. It's okay."

"It's not okay..." Charlie blubbered. "I could've done something, I could've done something to stop him."

"Could you have?" I asked him.

"Yes..! Yes, I could've... I could've... I could've done something..."

"Like what, Charlie? What could you have done?"

"I don't know, something!"

"Charlie, it isn't your fault."

"Yes, it is, it's my fault,"

"No, how could it be your fault? He got arrested while you were in a whole other state!"

"Yes, that's the point!"

"What are you talking about?"

"I fled from home, twice now, abandoning him like a broken object. I could've stayed and tried to fix things,"

"No, Charlie."

"I could've fixed him, it was my duty to help him, but I ran away. I hated him for almost all my life and then I ran away."

"Charlie..."

"Why? Why am I being punished? What did I do wrong? What have I ever done to him?" Charlie growled. I tried to hold him tighter to relieve the stress, but it didn't do anything to extinguish his anger. "I've tried so hard to please him all my life and I never get the appreciation I deserve! Why is life so fucking hard? Why can't I just be loved?"

"Charlie, this isn't your punishment. It's his." I said, pulling apart from the hug and holding him with both my paws by his chin. "He did this to himself, it was his decisions that led him here, not yours. It was his fault you ran away, not yours. It was his duty to love and protect you, and he failed. Charlie, I know what I'm saying is extremely hard to handle, but that's life, right? Remember what you said to me? You can't be happy without any hurt."

Charlie looked up at me, his eyes red and his body shivering.

It's time I tell him another truth.

"I still see him." I admitted, a single tear falling from my eye. "I still see him, at the edge of the bed, beaten and bloodied, when I wake up and when I go to sleep, every time. I saw him when I was at home, I saw him when I stayed at Becca's, and I still see him now. He's never gonna leave me. He never will. That image of him will forever stay in the back of my mind, haunting me like a ghost, but you know what? I have to live with it. I have to acknowledge that he'll be there whenever I wake up or go to sleep. I have to deal with the image of him, why? Because I love you, Charlie. And I'm not giving up on us. In order for me to love you, I have to live with him. I have to live with that image in my mind, no matter how long it stays to haunt me. The looming fear that you weren't good enough for your father will kill you if you don't learn to deal with it. You have to let it haunt you, no matter how painful it is. These ghosts may be our enemies, but we have to learn how to deal with them."

_I have no idea how this was all coming out of my mouth. I was just saying what I felt in my heart._

"I always thought the world was against me," I squeezed Charlie's paws even harder, closing in on the space between the two of us. His eyes were closed, his fur wet and unkempt. "But, now, I realize that it was making me stronger. It's making you stronger, too. And if you think for a second that I, or anybody else, don't love and appreciate you, then you're the dumbest man I've ever met in my entire life."

Charlie's audible crying had suddenly been silenced. His eyes were still closed. I was scared he hadn't been listening.

"Charlie..." I sniffled, wanting his attention. "Please say something."

He opened his eyes, looking down at me.

"Skyler..." He began, his voice had given out. "What did I do to deserve you?"

I chuckled breathlessly, relieved his spirits were lightened.

"Sky, I‚Äî" Charlie attempted to speak before I placed my finger up to his lips.

"If you're gonna go on a whole rant about how you love me too, I know, Charlie." I smiled, my eyes watering once again. I'm never gonna be able to go a day without crying. "You've expressed your love for me far too many times. Don't feel obligated to tell me whenever I try to show you my love, because I know. I know how much you appreciate me, and I don't need you to tell me with words. I'll always know."

"Sky, please, let me say this at least." Charlie begged.

I sighed, allowing him to say what he had to say.

"Thank you. Thank you for... staying by my side through this whole mess. It shows that... the world really does care. It shows you care." Charlie professed, his voice breaking up. "You're one of the few people I really, truly love. I hope you know how rare that is. I hope you know how much you matter to me."

"As I said," I giggled, Charlie doing the same. "I'll always know."

We touched our foreheads together, before locking lips for another sweet, loving kiss. This one lasted a while. As we exchanged breaths, I suddenly started to wonder where my life could've ended up if I had never met him. I didn't want that idea lingering in my head.

"Can we go back to bed, now?" I laughed.

"Let's hope we didn't wake the others," Charlie whispered, our noses touching.

Hand in hand, we returned to the bedroom for another affectionate, pleasant, night of luxurious sleep. Together.

I knew that even though I had spoken a whole 500-word essay to him, he'd still be hurting. We all are hurting.

I wanted to do something for him that mattered.

So, as we laid in the bed, I began to gently trace circles around Charlie's belly button.

Something his mother used to do to him whenever he was upset.

_Though I've always wanted the hard times to be over, as I have grown I began to understand that those hard times will always be there, no matter how much time passes. Those hard times will haunt us possibly to the end of our days, and I say, 'let them'. Those hard times make us who we are._

_And who we are is a gift._

# 34. I NEED TO DO SOMETHING

\~~~

## Charlie

Skyler is a gift.

I don't know what kind of trick the world pulled in order to get the two of us together, but it definitely worked. And I'm definitely not complaining.

He's probably been the best thing that has ever happened to me.

Waking up to Sky is one of the most exciting parts of my day, because when he's the first thing I see in the morning, I know that things are going to be okay.

The morning sun illuminated Sky's blue and pink fur, reflecting the color palette all over the room. He was sound asleep on my chest. My arms were wrapped around him completely. I must not have wanted to let him go.

I just hope I didn't crush Skyler in his sleep. Sometimes, I forget how small and slippery he is.

It was finally Saturday. I could stay in bed with Skyler all morning if I wanted to.

Just the two of us.

  

Suddenly, the door barged open as Jonathan marched in with the other half of a Nintendo Switch controller. I flinched a little, but kept steady as not to wake Sky.

"Get downstairs. We're playing Smash." Jonathan ordered, dropping the blue controller on the pillow beside my head.

"Can't you see I'm in the middle of something?" I whined, nodding towards the cat that was resting on top of me.

"You're always in the middle of something," Jonathan remarked. "We used to play video games all the time in high school before you got a girlfriend and became too cool for me."

"I'll never be too cool, and you know that."

"Well, now you have another distraction to our friendship." He pointed at Skyler.

"We had a long night." I pouted, petting Sky's head.

"Yeah, we heard."

"We didn't wake you guys, did we?"

"Oh, you did. Trust me, you did." Jonathan mockingly nodded his head. "Now, you're gonna make it up to me." Jonathan crossed his arms, turning to leave. "Bros before hoes."

"Ten more minutes," I grunted, nestling my snout into Sky's head.

"Your ass better be down here when your ten minutes are over," Jonathan warned, leaving the room.

Classic Jonathan. He may sound insulting at times, but this is just how he is. Sarcastic.

Once he was gone, I heard a muffled Sky giggling drowsily.

"You two are adorable," Sky teased while smothered in my chest.

"That's my word," I whined. "Did he wake you up?"

"I understand everything now, Jonathan's your match, not me."

"Shut up."

"I should just stay out of the way, you two are perfect for each other."

"You're not funny."

Skyler picked his head up from my chest and rested his chin on it instead, his face directed towards mine. He forcefully exhaled with a laugh of relief.

"Go and play your damn game with your boyfriend." He teased, his eyes squinting, unable to adjust to the bright lights of dawn.

"But, I want to stay with you."

"Hey, what did I say about making things about me? Don't distance yourself from your best friend because you want to protect me. Do what's right for you, Charlie." Sky suggested.

He's so selfless sometimes. I love how appreciative and intelligent he is. I think I scored myself the perfect guy.

"Besides, we have our shift at Amber's anyway, did you forget about that?"

"Shit, you're right," I complained, rubbing my sinuses.

"You better go and play with him before time runs out," Sky told me.

I didn't want to leave him alone. I know how things can get when he's by himself.

"Do you see him?" I asked Skyler.

"Who?"

"You know who..." I spoke under my breath.

Sky opened his eyes fully, lifting his head off from my body and looking around the room.

"Not at the moment." He stated, lying his head back down on my chest.

"You know if he was here, I'd fuck him up." I bragged seductively.

"Yeah, you would." Sky giggled, snuggling in closer.

"I'd totally fuck him up."

"Mhm."

"I love you, Sky." I kissed him on the forehead, sliding out from underneath him and grabbing the blue controller.

"Love you, too."

Heading down to the living room right after waking up and playing video games with Jonathan in our pajamas reminded me of old times. After Jonathan and I met in seventh grade, we became best friends almost immediately. We had sleepovers almost every night and created a bond unlike any other. When we woke up, we would play Pok√©mon or some other game on our Nintendo 3Ds'. Those games basically formed our friendship.

Sky was right. There are people who love and appreciate me.

When I said Sky was one of the few people I truly love, I wasn't lying. There used to be only two people in that area: Jonathan, as a brother, and Cassie, as my best friend. Now, there's Skyler; my lover.  

Though he's fragile and needing of care, he knows when to limit himself of my affection.

Contrary to popular belief, Sky has probably taught me more than I have taught him. From him, I've learned how to appreciate myself, keep healthy relationships, open up to others, and think wiser. Sky helped me grow up and out of that young, immature stage.  

But, just because I've grown out of it, doesn't mean I can't experience it every once in a while.

Jonathan and I laughed as our video game characters clashed against one another. We never picked favorites when it came to choosing our avatars. We would always select randomly and play with whoever we got. It was our method. That way, every battle would end fair and square.

"Do you like him?" I decided to ask Jonathan in the middle of a tournament.

"Like who?" Jonathan responded, still focused on the battle.

"You know," I hinted in a quieter voice. "Sky."

"Of course, I like him," Jonathan answered. "I like anyone you pick, you're a wise person."

"But, my first and second relationships‚Äî"

"Well, they picked you, so it doesn't count."

I can always look to Jonathan to motivate me about something I'm unsure about.

"Do I make time for you?"

"What do you mean?"

"I haven't been distant from you since I started dating Sky, have I?"

"Well... You're always a little bit farther than usual, but I don't mind it. You're dating, you're happy, I'm dating, I'm happy. We both deserve this. And we'll never stop being brothers, you hear that?"

"Yeah, man." I nodded my head.

I should probably call Cassie sometime soon. Just to see how she's doing. I've been so busy lately with Sky and school that I haven't been able to call her and talk about the stuff we would normally talk about. I don't think she even knows about Skyler. I should start making more time for my friends. As Sky said, I should be doing what's right for me.

Moments later, Sky came down to the living room with a blanket wrapped around him.

"Morning, sleepyhead," I called out to him as he made his way over to us. He was stumbling and still half-asleep.

"Morning," He yawned, collapsing onto the couch next to me.

"Wanna play Smash?" Jonathan suggested, holding his controller out to him.

"Nah, it's okay." Sky shook his head. "I was never one for video games."

"Loser," I teased, nudging him in the shoulder.

"Morning, boys." Sky and I heard a female voice greet us from behind us.

Instinctively, we turned around to see Claire, loosely dressed in Jonathan's oversized hoodie and shorts.

Skyler looked at me. I looked at him. We looked at each other.

She seemed even more tired than Sky, yawning profusely and scratching her back.

"Morning, babe." Jonathan swooned, watching his mistress come down and kiss him on the cheek.

Sky rolled his eyes. He hates that word.

"Long night?" I snickered. Sky softly slapped me in the leg.

"Yes, a very long night," Claire cooed seductively at Jonathan while entering the kitchen. Jonathan blushed and covered his face with his paws. "I'm making pancakes. 'Cause, you all know I'm a boss at making pancakes."

"You're a boss at everything you cook." Jonathan complemented, Claire jokingly placing her hand to her heart in a sense of appreciation.

"Pancakes sound really good right about now." Skyler moaned, resting his head to the ceiling on the couch frame.

"Mhm," I agreed, playfully pulling him into my arms. He started to snort with laughter as I began to kiss his neck. Sky is ticklish like that.

"Y'all are something else." Jonathan rolled his eyes.

We all laughed in unison.

The four of us then spent the rest of our free time in the morning eating pancakes with maple syrup, whipped cream, and Claire's special homemade fruit sauce, while playing video games on the Nintendo Switch. After me and Jonathan fought a few rounds, we switched it up and added Claire into the mix. We took turns, Jonathan battled Claire one round, then I battled her the second round. Surprisingly, she beat both of us. Then, we finally convinced Sky to try it out. Amusingly, he struggled majorly and failed countless times, but eventually got a kick out of it in the end.

It was adorable.

\~~~

## Skyler

Duty calls.

Jonathan and Claire decided to tag along as we walked to begin our morning shift at Amber's. Charlie and I held hands the whole way there. I remember when I was too afraid to do that in public, but things have really changed, haven't they?

Claire made a call and invited Becca to join us as well. It's been a while since we've had our usual Breakfast Club hangouts, and this was a perfect way to initiate a new member.

Jonathan and Claire were oddly amazed by our daily routine of unlocking the shop, organizing tables, marking the chalkboards, and setting up the counter. I guess they just thought it was fun to have Amber's all to themselves when nobody else was around. And, of course, they helped us out in the process.  

Once Charlie and I got our aprons and name tags on, Claire gushed about how cute we looked and begged to take a photo.

Becca came in along with the morning customers, joining Claire and Jonathan at the usual place we sat in the back.

About an hour had passed and the coffee shop was relatively empty. Charlie and I decided to pull a sneaky trick and close the shop for a small moment. Charlie placed a sticky note on the glass door that wrote, "On break!" It was like a VIP zone.

I went up to Jonathan, Claire, and Becca and asked if they wanted anything, writing down their orders. Charlie and I made them quickly and brought them to the couch where the Breakfast Club meetings would usually take place.

The rest applauded us for our hard work as we set the drinks and pastries on the coffee table surrounded by the couch and recliners.

As I sat next to Charlie on the couch, the five of us engaged in a conversation full of laughs and positivity.

They helped me set up my new iPhone, showing me how to maneuver through the home screen and the various apps. I must've acted like a grandmother, because I had no idea how to use it. The only piece of technology I ever used was the (deceased) Surface Pro. Sure, they all mocked me for being a boomer, but it was all in good fun. After it was all ready, I added their numbers to my contact list.

Claire decided to make a group chat, naming it the you-know-what.

"Man, remember our last Breakfast Club meeting?" Jonathan scoffed.

"You mean when things were normal?" I joked, taking a sip of my iced tea. Everyone else released a half-humorous, half-saddened exhale of laughter.

"Yeah, things got pretty derailed since then," Charlie noted.

"The calm before the storm," Claire added.

"Thanksgiving weekend really wasn't that thankful, huh?" Becca winced.  

We all chuckled softly, sending us into an awkward, silent ambiance.

_That Thanksgiving weekend... So much had happened to me... that I never considered thinking about what was happening to others. Jonathan had injured his leg, Claire was worried about him, Becca probably had no idea where her wolf twin was, and Charlie..._

Charlie...

"Speaking of, Charlie," I spoke aloud the moment the thought came to me. "You never told me what happened at your father's dinner party. How did it go?"

Charlie sighed.

_Uh-oh, that's a bad sign._

"Well... things didn't exactly go great..." Charlie sighed.

"Oh, no." I fretted, placing my paw on his arm. "What did he do?"

"More like what I did," Charlie scoffed. "I was annoyed by how he was treating me, so, you know, I kind of exposed him in front of all his friends." His voice trailed off in the end. He was embarrassed about it.

"Seriously?" I gasped, shocked by how calm he was about it.

"Yeah, it was pretty rough."

"Is that all?"

"Oh, uh... Well..." Charlie hesitated. This was likely something he hasn't told anyone yet. "I... kinda... came out to him."

Everyone in the room stared at him with disbelief.

I think I was visibly the most shocked.

"Jesus Christ, Charlie," I gasped, sliding closer to him on the couch. "You just decided not to mention that? With me, even?"

"I was too busy worrying about you." Charlie teased, brushing his finger through the fur behind my ear.

"Shut up," I moaned, grabbing his paw and separating it from his head.

"How did that go down?" Becca wondered.

"I dunno, I just... told him I had a boyfriend and then left. I didn't know how he would react. And I still don't know... " Charlie then paused as something came to mind. "Actually, I do know."

"What do you mean?" Claire asked.

I knew exactly what he meant.

"He got arrested."

"Oh my god, Charlie," Jonathan gasped concernedly. "I'm so sorry."

"I should be the one worrying about you." I joked, trying to lighten the mood.

"Yeah, you should," Charlie smirked, pulling me in closer.

"You guys should be worrying about each other," Becca added, poking at her half-eaten bagel. "Isn't that how healthy relationships function?"

She seemed saddened.

I remembered what we talked about that night I stayed at her place.

She feels left out.

Decisively, I picked up my iced tea.

"I think it's time we honor our newest Breakfast Club member." I smiled.

"Ooo, yes!" Claire beamed, grabbing her iced latte excitedly. Becca began to blush as Jonathan and Charlie both held up their drinks.

"C'mon, Becs." I urged. She rolled her eyes, picking up her strawberry smoothie.

"To Becca," Charlie stated.

"To Becca!" We all cheered as we clinked our drinks together.

"Perfect, now you're stuck with us. You can't escape our love for you anymore!" Claire laughed, we all did the same.

As we sipped our drinks, the coffee shop got quiet once again. But, this time, it felt nice.

I saw everyone around me. Becca, Claire, Jonathan, Charlie.

We all care about and love each other.

_I've... I've finally found my people. My friends. My family._

I looked at my tea, seeing my reflection in it.

_I don't think I've ever felt this good in so long._

_This happy. This confident._

_I'm heading down the right path._

_If only Mom, Dad, and Cal could see me now._

_If only... they could see me now..._

"I need to do something." I accidentally spoke out loud, breaking the silence.

"Hm?" Charlie murmured, turning his head up to me.

"I need to do something," I whispered to myself, not focusing on anything or anyone in the room but my reflection in the tea. "I need to leave."

"Are you okay?" Charlie placed his paw on my shoulder.

"I need to go home."

"What?"

"I need to go home..."

"Oh, a-alright, why‚Äî"

"Not the apartment. I need to go home, home."

"Sky, what are you talking about?"

"I need to do something."

Everyone stared at me as if I was losing my mind.

I can't blame them, I'm muttering things to myself like a psycho.

"I need to book a flight and leave, like, right now." I planned, looking up at the clock hung on the wall. It's still early enough. I still have time.

"Sky, hold on, can you tell me what you need to do?"

I turned my head to him.

"I can't," I realized, backing away from his grasp. "I'm sorry I can't tell you, any of you, but I need to go." I blurted out as I hurriedly stood straight up from the couch and marched towards the door.

"Sky, wait!" Charlie called out to me as I took off my apron and name tag and threw them on the counter. Charlie grabbed my arm before I could leave the coffee shop.

"Sky, what are you doing? Why are you just leaving all of the sudden?" He interrogated, placing his paws on my shoulders.

"I... I have to do something." I emphasized, trying to break free of his hold.

"I know that, but can you talk to me for a moment before you abandon us?" He reasoned.

_O__nce again, h__e was distressed. Because of me. I was worrying him. I wish there was a way for me to calm his nerves without letting him know what I was up to. And why I had to leave so soon._

"Charlie... I wish I could tell you, but I can't." I sighed, placing my paws on his. "I need to go back to the apartment, pack a bag, and go home."

"Sky‚Äî"

"I won't be long. I'll leave tonight. I'll be back Sunday at the latest."

"Skyler!" Charlie exclaimed frantically.

_I feel so bad._

_But, I can't let this feeling go to waste. I need to take my chance before I chicken out. I don't care how impulsive it is._

I leaned up and kissed Charlie's lips.

"I'm so sorry that I have to go like this, but it can't wait any longer," I told him remorsefully.

"What can't?"

"I'll be back Sunday, I promise. I'm just going home."

"Why?"

"I need to do something."

\~~~

I ran back to the apartment alone. I had called an Uber from my new phone to take me to the airport. I hadn't had the app until now, so it took a bit to install it, create an account, and learn how to pay for a driver. While I did that, I grabbed my backpack and stuffed a single change of clothing and nothing else. Whatever else I needed was already at home.

I looked at the time. 1:30.

_I'll get there. I can get there in time, and come back to Charlie tomorrow._

As the Uber driver pulled up in front of the house, I walked down the steps with my bag in hand, only to hear Charlie shouting my name.

I turned my head to the right to see him racing down the sidewalk.

"Sky! What the fuck is going on!?"

I dropped my bag to the floor as he approached me.

"Charlie, I'm sorry about how sudden this all is." I apologized, placing my paws on his shoulders.

"Yeah, it's sudden, you can't just leave out of the blue and expect me to be fine with it," Charlie argued, a hint of anger in his voice.

"Charlie, you have always trusted me on things." I reminded him. "You could trust anyone. It's almost blind trust when it comes to you. It's unconditional. Right now, I need you to trust me more than ever, okay?"

"Can't you just tell me what you're doing?" Charlie worried, his voice becoming more and more anxious.

"I can't, Charlie, I really can't."

"Why not?"

"Because this is something I have to do for myself, and I can't let anybody else affect it. Not even you."

Charlie's eyes began to well up.

"I just got you back." He whimpered, his voice now breaking up. "Why are you leaving me again? I thought I did everything right, I thought I loved you, I thought I cherished you, I thought I did everything to make you feel welcome‚Äî"

"Oh, no, Charlie, you did do everything right." I interrupted. I couldn't let him blame himself for this. I've always hated it when he blamed himself for things that didn't involve him. He may seem intrepid and outgoing at first glance, but he's very feeble on the inside. He overthinks too much, just like me. "You did more than right, in fact. The problem is, I didn't. I need to fix this one thing, okay? I'm not leaving you, Charlie. I'm making my stay permanent." I promised him. "I have to make things right. I promise you, Charlie. By tomorrow night, I'll be back in your arms. You'll be able to hold me again and call me adorable as much as you'd like." I said with a laugh. "We'll fall asleep holding each other just like we always do, or, we'll stay up and talk about this as much as you want, but for now, I need to go. Nothing will be different, I swear. Nothing will, except for the fact that everything will be right."

"Right?" Charlie looked at me. He wanted to believe me so badly, but he just couldn't.

"This has been so good, Charlie. So, so good. You've been an angel, nonstop. All you do is worry and care about me, and, trust me, I love it so much. I love you so much. I love who we are together. I love what we've done for each other." I smiled, recalling everything the two of us had been through. "For once in my life, I'm happy and free and thriving, but... there's just one problem that needs fixing. One problem. This is the last thing I need to do, then everything will be right. It's just one last thing." I swore, praying to God that he'd understand. Charlie nodded his head with a sniffle. I jumped up and wrapped my arms around him tightly. "I love you, Charlie. I have never loved anyone more than you."

"I love you, too." He whispered into my ear.

I placed my muzzle on his, caressing his fur. The kiss was extra-long, allowing Charlie to savor every moment before I left.

We separated and I grabbed my bag.

"I'll call you!" I told him, opening the back door of the car.

"Please, be safe." Charlie wished as I got inside.

# 35. COMING OUT

\~~~

## Skyler

Being cramped in a confined space with two other strangers for five hours didn't exactly ease my nerves. Somehow, I had ended up in between them. Initially, when I first boarded the airplane, there was only one person in the three-seat row by the window, so I took the aisle seat. But, another person came to our row, and sadly, my social anxiety got the best of me. I tried to be nice and offer up the aisle seat, pushing me into the middle. Now, I'm stuck between to animals for five hours. Sometimes, I really hate the decisions I make.

I was never comfortable with flying alone. In fact, when I first got here in August, it was the first time I had ever rode an airplane by myself. I wanted to watch a movie on the screen or binge a TV series, but I was too afraid of what the others would think, so I just listened to music the whole time. Yes, five hours of music. I didn't even sleep.

Once I arrived in my home state, I checked into a nearby motel that was a few towns away from mine. I had left so suddenly, hoping that I could make it to my parents' house before it got late. But, it was 9:50 when we landed. This was the only flight available for the weekend.

I took an airport taxi and drove to the nearest place to crash. Spending the night alone in a cheap, run-down motel was an experience, to say the least.  

I texted Charlie, telling him that I had landed. He asked if we could go on a facetime call, so I agreed under the condition that he wouldn't ask me any questions. We spent the whole night talking to one another about normal things that we'd usually talk about. I felt safer in that hotel room with Charlie on the phone. I felt so safe, in fact, that I accidentally fell asleep in the middle of the call. Charlie texted me about it in the morning. He said it was adorable, since, although we were separated, he still got to watch me sleep.

Technology.

On Sunday, I packed up my things and left for home.

I was beginning to get a hang of using my phone, ordering another Uber as if I had done so a million times before.

Getting into the Uber, I acknowledged the fact that the car would be taking me to a destination that will probably change my life forever.

What I was about to do was terrifying. Completely, utterly terrifying.

But, I had to do it.

_What if they don't love me anymore?_

_What if they treat me differently?_

_What if they are disappointed in me? Or worse, themselves?_

All these thoughts raced through my mind as the distance between myself and my home decreased inch by inch.

My limbs felt fragile and began to tremble. I was getting nervous shocks, goosebumps were running down my spine. I pulled at my whiskers multitudinous times.

_I love my family. I would never want to lose them._

_I'm sure, by now, you know what I'm doing._

I'm sure you understand how hard this is for me, to out these feelings that have been locked inside of me my whole life, feelings that I never came to terms with because I believed so passionately that it wasn't how I should've felt.

People tell you that's not how you should feel.

My family, _my parents,_ struggled and toiled for 18 years of my life, providing for me, loving me, shaping me into the person they want me to be.

_Is it so bad that the person I want to be is myself?_

_They love me,_ I say.

_They love me,_ I tell myself a thousand times, over and over.

_They just want the best for me._

_How hard can it be to tell them that I'm, just, built differently?_

_I like boys, despite me being a boy myself._

_No, I wasn't influenced or had this idea forced upon me from peers or... Charlie..._

_I've always felt different._

_Sure, I told myself that my sexuality was unidentified in the early stages of my life... but... in high school, I couldn't help but look at other boys with their girlfriends sometimes, and imagine me being those girlfriends._

_I didn't know whether I liked those boys or I wanted to be those girls._

_It was either, I like boys, or, I wanted to be a girl._

_I didn't choose._

_I didn't want to._

_I was afraid that I'd say both._

About an hour later, I arrived home.

My safe, welcoming, suburban bungalow household.

Despite the icy-cold weather and snow blanketing the ground all around me, the image of the house I grew up in warmed every part of my body. I was beginning to lose all my doubts.

My eyes locked onto the familiar sight and every aspect of it. The front lawn, covered in white. The stone pathway that led to the porch. The wooden stairs that led to the door. The door that led to the house. The house that led to my family.

I took a deep breath.

_Once you knock on that door, there's no turning back._

I heard the Uber drive off behind me, solidifying my opportunity. _It's now or never._

_C'mon, Skyler. You got this._

I made my way up the steps and to the door. I raised my paw, clenching it into a fist. I knocked on the door four times.

I hear footsteps come closer from the other side of the door. I hear the door unlock. The door swings open.

There she is, Olympia Pedretti-Clawfield, my mom. She's so beautiful. She looks exactly like me, but older. And prettier. We're almost the same height. She's the taller one.

The second she sees me in the doorway, her whole face lights up.

"Mommy," I whispered, a smile on my face.

"Sky‚Äî!" She shouts in excitement, before immediately covering her mouth.

I'm guessing she didn't want to wake _him._

Trying her best not to scream, she scooped me up and hugged me intensely.

"Oh my god, oh my god!" She muttered rapidly to herself, rubbing the back of my head. I smiled uncontrollably in her embrace. She has an overjoying aura. I love her so much.

"Thompson! Skyler made a visit!" She half-yells, half-whispers behind her back.

"What?!" I hear my father's voice shriek, the sound of a pan dropping to the floor coming from the kitchen. Me and my mom begin to laugh out of embarrassment.

Soon, my dad runs in. Thompson Clawfield. Somehow, he looks old and young at the same time, but amazingly charming in every way. He always wears a button-up suit with a fancy tie, always. He looks like a little businessman. He always knows how to make me and Mom laugh.

"Sky! We didn't know you were coming!" He exclaims, squeezing into our group hug.

We take a moment to fully embrace each other before separating. Even though it's been only three days since I last saw my parents, it must've felt like a while for them. My parents are very protective of me, even more so after everything that happened. They were wary when I told them I wanted to go back to the apartment, but they allowed it as long as I stayed safe or had a friend to watch over me.

I said I had a friend. A really good one.

"What's the occasion?" My mom asks, out of breath from the excitement and smiling profoundly.  

"Just... wanted to make a visit!" I say in a super false voice.

"Well, come on in, let me get cleaned up so we can chill!" My dad plans, running off into the hallway. He's always trying to sound cool, making sure he fits in with the Gen Z stereotype so I can like him better.

It makes me cringe, but I still love him.

My mom closes the door behind me and takes my jacket and my bag.

"Don't get too comfortable, I'm only staying for a bit. I have to leave tonight in order to get back to Ch‚ÄîTo campus in time for school tomorrow." I don't know why I was stopping myself from saying his name when the reason I came here was to...

"We didn't expect you to visit!" Mom chuckles, hanging my coat up in the closet by the front door.

"Oh, sorry, I should've called." I stuttered. "Just thought I could... surprise you both."

"That's perfectly okay, we love the company!" She smiles, kissing my cheek.

"Mom..!" I whine in embarrassment, pushing her away.

"How did you get here? All alone?" She asks, sitting down at the coffee table in the living room. It's so bright in here. All the walls are either made from wood or bricks, it looks like a cottage inside. Some of my drawings are still hung up in frames. I thought they'd take them down by now, but I should've remembered how proud they are of me. They tell me over and over that I'm the best thing that has ever happened to them. I would beg to differ, but I wouldn't want to shatter their hearts.

"I... booked a flight," I said, confidently.

"Really? Did you fly by yourself?" She asked.

"Obviously, yeah."

When I first flew alone in August, I was so terrified about leaving my parents that I cried at the airport. In front of millions of strangers. It surprised my mom to know that flying alone was a choice that I made myself without hesitation.

"Oh my god, Sky! Who would've known college would boost your confidence?" She said, sarcastically. I knew what she was hinting at.

She had told me this exact thing before I left in August.

"College will boost your confidence, Sky!" She had said to me months ago.

My biggest fear is losing friends and family.  

I was so frightened to be in another state without anyone I knew, me being my shy self. I wasn't prepared for college. The thought of being alone was, obviously, the main reason why, but my mom still wouldn't stop for anything to motivate me. I had sent out multiple letters to various schools to apply, and the Cloverland Institute Of Visual Arts was the only school that accepted me.

"Yeah," I sighed, looking to the ground, knowing the real reason my confidence was boosted.  

Obviously, my mom picked up on that. She picks up on everything. That's one of the quirks that make her so special.

"Hey, what's wrong?" She asked, a little concerned.

"I..." Here goes. "The real reason I came here... was to talk to you guys about something," I revealed the same time my dad walked in.

"Well, what did you want to talk to us about?" My dad asked.

I hesitated before speaking.

_This is it, Sky._

_You can do this._

_Just tell them the truth..._

"Oh, god, did you lose your virginity?" My mom assumed, standing up.

"What?! No, Mom!" I sputtered, blushing.

"It's okay if you did, just‚Äî" My mom sighed.

"No, Mom, I did not... lose my virginity." I scoffed, my mom sitting back down. "You know I'm not like that."

I looked over at the chair at the front of the dining table. I went over and sat in it. My mom and dad joined me on either side.

"Skyler, what's going on?" My mom asked, joining me at the table. My father did, too. They both sat on opposite sides of me.

"Okay..." I exhaled harshly.

I closed my eyes, trying to search for the right words to say. The right way to break the news that wasn't too shocking nor worrisome. But, my heart was beating fast. The way my parents were staring deeply into my eyes was making me regret ever having this conversation with them. It's about to happen. Everything was moving way too quickly and I couldn't hang on. I started to get emotional.

"I... My... Mom..." I stuttered, thinking of better ways to say this exact thing to them.

I sniffled, setting off my parents' nervous system.

"Oh, honey, we're here for you, you know that, right?" My mom comforted me, placing her paw on my arm.

"You can tell us anything, you can trust us." My dad said, patting me on the shoulder.

"Can you promise me that when I confess this to you... that you'll still love me and treat me the same?" I pleaded.

"We promise." My parents told me.

Tears emerged from my eyes. They really did love me. They'd do anything for me.

They won't ever judge me for who I am.

I was stupid to think they wouldn't.

I love my parents. I love them.

They've been with me since the day I was born, and they still are now.

They deserve to know the truth.

_They deserve to know who I am._

"Mom... Dad..." I whispered, closing my eyes.

  

"I've fallen in love with a boy."

  

The room was silent.

I used to say this theory that silence didn't exist because silence, is in fact, a noise itself.

But, at this moment, I truly believed it did. Silence really did exist.

It was nothing.

A zone of nothing.

You feel something is supposed to be happening, life is supposed to be moving on, but it halts unexpectedly.

I could already feel their eyes staring at me. I kept my eyelids shut, tears streaming down my fur.

The silence lasted forever. I didn't know when it would end. It was torturous.

_Am I dreaming?_

_It feels like the world has somehow paused, and if I were to open my eyes I would see the sight of my parents in a frozen state, about to say something, but I'll never get to hear it._

_That would be worse. Way, way worse._

Suddenly, like a wrecking ball hitting a solid surface, I felt the arms of my parents wrap around me. It was strong and unexpected.

"Oh, Skyler..." I heard my mother whisper.

"We love you more than anything in the world, no matter who you like." She expressed, her voice breaking.

"You are everything to us, and we don't care if you feel different, you'll always be the same to us. You'll always be our son." My dad had spoken.

_It happened._

_It really happened._

_They accepted me._

I opened my eyes to see two loving faces, seeing me for who I truly am.

I wish I could've see them clearly, my eyes were blurry due to how much I was crying. I hate being so emotional. I wish there was a limit to how much you can cry, how many tears are left in the tear bank, because I'd be wrung dry.

But, it felt good to be crying at this time.

I deserve to cry right now.

"I... I love you guys!" I cried, tears pouring out like a waterfall.

I couldn't help it. I was overwhelmed with a million feelings, all representing different aspects of myself. I was sad because I had the audacity to think they wouldn't accept me. I was happy because they did. I was in love because... well... I could now be open about Charlie.

"Oh, sweetheart." My mom laughed, cradling my head.

"We love you too, Skyler." My dad expressed, patting my back.

I couldn't stop smiling. Along with the other feelings, I was beginning to feel emotions I've never felt before. I was so, so joyful. Nothing could ruin this moment. It was just me and my parents. Nothing else mattered.

I laughed, wiping my tears away.

"Oh my god... I'm so sorry." I apologized, looking down at the teardrops staining the tablecloth below.

"Oh, that's okay." My mom giggled.

The three of us couldn't stop laughing. And crying.

Laugh crying.

Possibly, the best form of crying you'd ever feel. Possibly, the best form of laughing, too.

Because you're laughing about something that's so important and meaningful, and you're crying about something that makes you cheerful and optimistic.

"Hey, I know something that could make this even better!" My dad brought up in an excited tone of voice.

"What?" My mom and I said in unison, rolling our eyes.

"I'll make us some hot chocolate!" He burst, lighting both me and my mother's faces up.

Dad's hot chocolate was a big hit in our house. We all loved it. He'd make it for us whenever we felt down and in need of love for several years. The tradition began when I was 8. I cut myself on a rock while falling over, so my dad made me hot chocolate from this new box of Swiss Miss that he got for sale at the supermarket. He made the best hot chocolate. It was so good that we'd even have it in the summer and all the other seasons. My dad was so amazing. I'm so thankful.

"Yeah! That would be nice, dad." I gushed, still wiping my tears away with the sleeve of my shirt.

My dad did a little jump for joy that made us both giggle as he disappeared back into the kitchen.

"So, tell me all about this boy!" My mom said, leaning in, interested.

"Mom..!" I covered my face with my paws.

"C'mon, I wanna know if he'd be a good addition to the family or a total idiot."

"Mom! He's my first boyfriend‚Äîhe's my first anything, really." I sighed.

My mom leaned in closer, a smile spreading from ear to ear, wanting to hear the details.

"Ugh, but he's such an angel," I admitted, daydreaming.

Charlie really is an angel. The thought of him being able to _actually_ meet my family under _actual_ circumstances was making me bubble with joy.

"Let me guess," Mom smirked, pretending to think hard. "Is it Charlie?"

"Y-yes, how did you‚Äî"

"Well... I walked in on him kissing your forehead." She told me.

Immediately, I groaned, resting my head onto the table.

"Yup, that's him." I cringed.

"He seemed very protective of you. I admired that." My mother crowed, petting my head. "To be brutally honest with you, I kind of noticed that something was there."

"Seriously?" I asked, picking my head up. "It's that obvious?"

"I didn't want to ask, the timing wasn't exactly right, if you know what I mean."

I nodded my head.

"What do you think of him?" I questioned.

"He's cute, Sky." My mom smirked. My face began to go red. "But, I'll have to know him better in order to fully accept him as my son's boyfriend. Because you deserve someone great."

"You know how we are," My dad joked as he came back into the dining room so fast it's as if he had those cups of hot chocolate prepared for us before I got here. He sat the three cups down on the table, taking his.  

We all had our favorite mugs. Dad knew exactly who wanted what, giving each of us our specific cup. He's been doing it for years. The cups were holiday-themed, painted in green and red colors with details including snow, presents, and a tree dressed in ornaments. I can't wait for Christmas.

"You're coming to stay with us on winter break, right?" My mom asked me.

"Of course!" I said, taking a sip of the hot chocolate.

"Why don't you invite Charlie? It'd be great to spend time with him on Christmas. If his family doesn't have plans with him, that is." She suggested.

"Oh, I'm sure he doesn't have plans..." I say to myself, the thought of his father passing through my mind. "But, this is great hot chocolate, dad."

Dad's hot chocolate was always the best. It never disappoints.

"Thank you, my treat." He smiled. "So, who's this boy again?"

"Oh, my god," I grumbled, laughing, facepalming, blushing, everything.

I've always felt that my whole life was leading up to this moment. Now, it's finally over. All the horror and doubts that I have gained throughout the course of my existence are finally gone. I feel free. Flawless. Nothing can stop this feeling. For once in my life, everything feels just right. Everything feels okay.

Everything feels perfect.

  

"Clouds?" I heard a small voice come from the hallway.

I looked up to see who was there.

"Hey, Cal." I smiled.

\~~~

I unlocked the front door as quietly as I could.

I removed my boots and set them down gently, trying my best not to make a noise.

In my socks, I tiptoed across the floor, up the stairwell, and down the carpeted hallway.

I opened the bedroom door.

It was 12 o'clock.

I looked to the left of the bedroom.

Charlie was in his own bed.

He was asleep.

I was finally back.

I wanted to leave as early as I could in order to get back to him at the promised time, but a certain someone kept me a little longer.

I wanted it to be like a romance movie. I would come out of the car, Charlie would be waiting on the steps. We'd run to each other, meet in the middle, embrace. Then, I would tell him everything.

Sadly, I didn't get that.

But, it didn't matter anymore.

I was back at my true home, with him.

I have never slept in Charlie's bed yet.

I crept into it slowly, lifting up the blanket so I could join him. He was facing the wall.

I wrapped my arms and legs around his body. The feeling of him was somehow renewed in light of the recent event.

I touched my face to the back of his neck. As much as I wanted him to hold me, I was fine with this. It was better than hugging a lifeless pillow to sleep.

  

Suddenly, I felt Charlie's tail begin to wag under the covers.

It almost smacked me in the face.

I moved back, knowing that he was awake.

His tail always wags when he's with me.

"Just, cuddle me already," I whispered jokingly.

Charlie turned around in the bed, immediately wrapping his arms around me, pulling me closer into his body. He was always so warm and tender. His fur felt the same, familiar and soothing. It felt so good for him to be holding me. It felt so, so good.

"You were right," I told him as he cradled me.

"About what?" He asked, looking into my eyes.

"My bed is so much more comfortable." I teased. Charlie laughed under his breath.

"Are you gonna tell me where you went now are you gonna keep enticing me?" He beamed, so happy that I was back.

I wanted to take a moment before I told him.

What I just did was something I was horrified by almost all my life. It was one of the many ghosts that haunted me throughout my years. Now, I get to feel open, safe, and unharmed. Now, I get to free myself of shame whenever I'm with my parents. And now, I get to tell the boy I love most that I'm finally, truly, happy.

"I did it, Charlie," I whispered, looking up at the ceiling, tears in my eyes. Those stupid cracks.

"I did it."

"Did what?" I had waited for Charlie to ask.

"I came out," I told him. "I came out to my parents."

Charlie looked at me with amazement in his eyes.

He was proud of me.

He was so proud of me.

"Skyler..." He whispered. "I'm... I'm so proud of you."

_Told you._

_I know my boyfriend._

"Why didn't you tell me?" He asked.

"Because, Charlie," I explained. "This was something I needed to do for myself. It was something I needed to do without the support or encouragement of others. Something that I had to make my own decision for. Something that I had to have the confidence, the optimism, and the love for in order to complete. And I did it, alright. I really did it."

Charlie exhaled a sigh of relief and of pride. I could see the fulfillment in his eyes.

"I'm sorry I left so suddenly. I promise I won't do it again."

"Don't worry about it, Sky." Charlie shook his head. "I'll always love you, no matter what."

"I love you, too."

"I love you more."

We touched our heads together, drifting into sleep.

One last teardrop fell from my eye.

At that moment, I knew it would be the last tear I would ever cry in a very long time.

# 36. DECT THE HALLS

### ACT IV**:** LOVERS

\~~~  

## Charlie

After Sky's constant nagging, I finally agreed to go Christmas shopping with him Monday afternoon. It was worth seeing his face light up with joy as he jumped onto me and gave me a huge hug.

I've never seen Sky so outgoing before. Although I wasn't really there for most of his life, I feel it's safe to say this is possibly the best he's ever been.

He's bright, he's ditzy, and most importantly, he's happy.

And that makes me happy.

Sometimes I feel like life is a movie. Not necessarily a movie, more like a story. We all have plotlines and we all have endings. It feels like Sky has reached his ending. He's finally who he is and he's thriving. I'm still waiting for mine.

Sky stood on the shopping cart as I pushed it, racing down the aisles of an annual Christmas-themed store in a shopping mall. The type that would only open during the holidays. Sometimes, I don't really understand why Christmas is advertised so early, like in November. October is a stretch, but it does happen. But, now, it makes sense. Christmas is only one week away.

Winter break starts this weekend. I don't know what I'm doing for it. I wanted to ask Sky what he was planning on doing, but I already knew he had plans with his family. I wish I could go with him. I don't want to be alone on what is supposed to be the happiest day of the year, according to Sky.

Skyler and I scanned the aisles for Christmas decorations that we wanted to put up in our room and around the apartment. We were put in charge of decorations. Well, we put ourselves in charge. No one else in the apartment wanted to do anything, so we took the responsibility of decking the halls all to ourselves.

I, initially, wanted to get a big Christmas tree for the living room, but after watching the Charlie Brown Christmas special with Sky a few nights ago, we both decided to find a small, dying spruce tree, and give it life.

Sky tossed red and green LED lights into the cart, while I grabbed small, useless figurines and pretty ornaments that seemed to fit the mood.

Me and Sky had a tiny argument over who should pay for all the stuff we got. We both vouched for ourselves, each wanting to pay for the whole mess ourselves. So, we decided to get two shopping carts, divided the items we collected by two, and each pay for whatever was in our cart. That way, the bill would be split. Love goes both ways.

When we got home, we layered the walls and rooms with decorations. Of course, Jonathan and Claire decided to help us out. Claire had somehow become one of us now. She spent almost every night in Jonathan's room, probably fucking him, but, you never know. I wonder if Dylan was forced to sleep outside or if he still slept in there while Claire spent the nights. Either way, poor dude.

Dill, Byron, and Milo all watched as we hung up streamers in the hallway. Jonathan tried his best to convince them to help, which, surprisingly, worked. They began to take items out of the shopping bags and put them wherever they saw fit.

It feels like we really made amends with them.

With Byron and Dylan, I mean.

I dunno what's going on in Milo's head.

He's just doing his own thing, I guess. Can't blame him.

Sky set up some of the green and red LEDs in our room. He hung it over the doorway, making it look like a portal to some interdimensional world. To be honest, our room is an interdimensional world. Sky also bought those electronic strip lights that you see on the ceiling of every teenage girl's TikTok video and installed them on ours. He adjusted them to show off more Christmas colors. He really likes LED lights. He likes it so much that it almost gets annoying. But, I could never dislike Skyler. I'm starting to like the strip lights, too.

"Hey, Sky, look," I called to him as he pressed random buttons on the remote that controlled the LEDs.

"Yeah?" He turned around and looked up at the thing I was holding in my hand above the two of us. His smile grew wide and he laughed. "Mistletoe."

"You know the rules," I smirked, dangling the plant over us.

Sky rolled his eyes as he stood on his toes, landing a kiss on my muzzle. He wrapped his arms around my neck as I picked him up from the floor, swirling around with him in my arms. We touched our heads together and giggled like toddlers.

Sky was right. Christmas really is a joyful time of year.

\~~~

On Tuesday, the five of us held up our caffeinated drinks and toasted to Skyler's success within Amber's. Claire couldn't stop hugging him and whispering things into his ears. Johnathan and Becca just gave him the usual friendly congratulation.

I really don't know what else to say.

It's great to see friendships blossom right in front of your eyes. This little thing at Amber's started all because I needed an excuse for looking oddly at Skyler that night in August, because... I liked him. This friend group progressed from having only two people, to now five. And possibly more in the future.

But, I feel like the most surprising fact is that I didn't help it grow, Sky did. He was the one who got me a job at Amber's, met Claire and became best friends with her, who then met my best friend Johnathan and started dating him, and Becca followed because she was best friends with Claire. This connection and bond that included all of us formed all because of Skyler. And I just watched it grow right in front of my eyes.

_Jesus, why do I love him so much?_  

_It's, just... It's such a good feeling to have someone that matters to you find out who they really are and begin to flourish from that epiphany._

The Breakfast Club decided to get festive by setting up a game of Secret Santa. If you've lived under a rock for all these years, basically, we all get the name of someone other than ourselves in the group and have to secretly get a gift for that person without them knowing. We all wrote our names onto scraps of paper and dropped them into Sky's black beanie. Sky mixed up the names and slid a slip to each of us.

Claire got the first name, then Becca, then Johnathan, then me, and finally, Sky himself. I opened my scrap of paper.

I got Claire. I'm honestly not disappointed. Claire is always the talkative one in our group, so I knew exactly what to get her.

The due date was Friday. The day winter break begins.

\~~~

On Wednesday, my photography teacher, Mr. Fimognari, gave my class a new assignment. It was to "capture the life on campus". He allowed us to go anywhere we wanted on CIVA and take photos of whatever we wanted. Something that represented what it's like to be a college student. Mr. Fimognari is a very honest professor, he doesn't bullshit anyone. This wasn't one of those assignments where we had to spotlight all the good things that were occurring and block out all the rest, no. Mr. Fimognari allowed us to capture the bad as well. We had to be truthful with our photos. That's what I like about photography. You can capture a million stories with only one click. They're like frozen movies. We had to collect our photographs, print them, add them to our portfolio, and then present them on Friday.

So, during our class period, me and my classmates set out across campus to take pictures. Of course, the first place I headed for was the art studio.

Without even going into the actual classrooms, I could already see creativity shining in the hallways. Canvases full of color adorned the walls. Origami-like paper crafts hung from fishing line from the ceiling. Ribbon, fabric, cloth, and other materials were used to form a rainbow that represented a brushstroke from a papier-m√¢ch√© paintbrush.

There was a glowing sense of pride in the art community. I took a photo.  

Mr. Bateman, Sky's art professor, was kind enough to let me take photos of the classroom while his students were working. I've always walked Sky up to the classroom through the beautiful hallways, but I never went inside. In the classroom, there were kids spread out all over the lecture hall, doing their own thing. I snapped a photo of the landscape and moved on. At the back of the room, I saw my familiar blue and pink kitten, focused on an easel that stood in front of him, with a palette in his hands. The canvas was blank, which was strange to see because of how whimsical Sky's mind is and how vibrant the room was. Almost every wall was painted a different color with different materials. The canvas stuck out like a sore thumb. Sky looked like he was contemplating on what to make, his arms crossed, his paw scratching his chin.

_I wonder what he was thinking? Imagining? Why was he so lost in the blank canvas at that moment? What was he planning to create?_

Those are all questions I love to ask when I take my photos. My work always includes normal, everyday settings but with a hint of inspiration. I want my work to be open to interpretation. Anyone can see it in a different way. Anyone can have different reasonings as to what it means. That's just like life. You never really know what it means, but everyone has a different opinion. It really shows off the definition of diversity. Community.

I snapped the photo of Sky, staring at the blank easel, with all the colorful painted walls in the background. It was a good photo.

I captured it at the right time, too. Sky had turned around immediately when he saw the camera flash illuminate his surroundings.

"Wha‚ÄîWhat are you doing here?" Sky smiled, excited to see me.

He's so adorable. I loved the way his face lit up the moment he noticed me. He had an apron on, coated with dry paint splatters and markings, and a pink and white bandana around his forehead, holding his fur back from his eyes. He may look like a mess, but he's a beautiful, lovely, glorious mess.

"Just doin' some work." I cheesed, sneaking up to his side.

"Where is that photo going?" Sky cautioned, looking down at my camera.

"It's for an assignment." I teased, holding it behind my back.

"Only an assignment, huh? You're not posting it anywhere, right?"

"But, it's such a good photo," I whined, giving him puppy eyes.

"I don't like being in photos." Sky laughed.

"It could work really well for my portfolio if I ever apply for a job."

"Charlie."

"Fine." I chuckled. "Look at it, at least."

Sky sighed as I took my camera back out, pulling up the photograph. He stared at it for a few seconds. I could see the tips of his mouth begin to rise.

"It's a good photo," Sky muttered, looking me in the eyes.

"Told ya," I smirked, wrapping the camera strap back around my shoulder. "What are you planning on making?" I wondered, referring to the blank canvas.

"I dunno." Sky admitted, staring back at it. "Mr. Bateman said to make a mental image of our minds."

"That sounds philosophical."

"Mhm." Sky nodded his head. "I guess I'll do what I always do. Start a line and see where my heart takes it."

Sky doused his paintbrush in the various colors on the palette, attracting a split of pastel pink and baby blue on the bristles.

"These two colors are my favorite combination," Sky told me as he started to dab the easel with his brush. "They look good separated, they look good side by side, they look good when they blend into each other, and they look good when they're mixed."

I held the camera up to my eye and zoomed in on the texture of the damp paint, slowly drying on the blank canvas, snapping another picture. Sky's favorite color combination. Makes sense, it's the two colors of his fur. Pastel pink and baby blue. It's also the two colors of his parents.

"I've been meaning to ask but, your parents..." I brought up as he brushed the canvas with a unique stroking method that I had never seen before. "Are you gonna stay with them for Christmas vacation‚Äî?"

"Oh, I almost forgot!" Sky interrupted, a big revelation on his mind. "My mom and dad invited you to spend winter break with us!"

After hearing that, my ears immediately perked up. My tail began to wag furiously.

"R-Really?" I stuttered, my hopes suddenly rising.

"Of course, Charlie!" Sky smiled sweetly, placing his paw on my shoulder. "Unless, you have plans..."

"After my dad, I'm not really sure..." I said in a low voice, chuckling awkwardly and scratching the back of my head.

"Right." Sky whispered back. "Sorry about that."

"No worries." I grinned, holding his hands, providing Sky with comfort. "I'd love to come, Sky. Seriously, I would love to come." I beamed, placing emphasis on the 'love'.

"Really? You'll come?" His eyes widened. His smile could make a whole room even brighter than it already is.  

"Of course, cutie, I'll come." I flirted, pushing my paw through the fur on his neck.

Sky giggled with glee as he jumped onto me, wrapping his arms around my torso and his head over my shoulders. I guess he was really pleased. He really wanted me to be a part of his family. I really do, too.

I couldn't help but laugh as Sky began to kiss my neck. I could tell other students in the classroom were looking at us, but I didn't care. I love it when Sky is this cheery.

"Oh, shoot." Sky moaned, looking down at my clothes as he parted his body from mine. "I got paint on you. I'm sorry."

I looked down to see the pink and blue stains on the sweater I was wearing. I chuckled, looking back up at him.

"That's all right." I forgave him.

"Are you sure? I can try to fix it," Sky mumbled, reaching for a roll of paper towels on the desk in front of him.

"No, no, I've actually been looking for a good reason to throw it out. Never liked it."

"If you're lying, I swear‚Äî" Sky scoffed, setting the palette down on the table.

"Why would I lie to you?" I bit my lip, putting my hands around Sky's small waist.

Sky began to giggle again. I love the way his laugh sounded. It was dorky and petite, but also shy and adorable. So adorable. Sky touched the tip of his nose to mine, giving me an Eskimo kiss. I love him. He's so, so adorable.

Sky then separated from me after noticing the onlookers in his peripheral vision, tucking his fur behind his head.

"You can't just tease me like that and not give me a kiss," I whispered, inching closer towards him in a seductive way.

"I'll make up for it in the bedroom." Sky joked, picking the palette and brush back up from the table.

"Ooh, a romantic rendezvous?" I teased, amorously.

"Shut up, go do your assignment." Sky blushed, playfully pushing me away by shoving his fingers into my chest.

"Paint your thing, then." I reflected, leaving him to his craft. Sky looked back at me, swooning as he dabbed the paintbrush back onto the palette.

I couldn't discard the smile that was plastered onto my face. Have you ever had that feeling where you've smiled too much and your facial muscles begin to ache when you do it again? If not, what are you doing with your life?

After looking at everyone's faces, I could tell we were being a little bit too obvious. I went to leave the classroom to see Mr. Bateman waiting at the door, smirking with his arms crossed.

"I thought you were just taking photos." Mr. Bateman remarked.

"Oh, yeah. Kinda forgot." I shrugged.

"Go on, get outta here." He said, holding the door open for me as I left.

\~~~

I snapped another photo of Sky. This time, he was sitting up in his bed, dressed in a bathrobe after just taking a shower, reading a mystery romance novel as the sun set in the large window behind him and the bed frame.

"Ah, stop!" Sky whined, blocking his face to the camera.

"It's not my fault you're so picturesque." I complimented, climbing into the bed next to him, landing my muzzle on his.

Sky put the book down as we made out, sinking deeper into the bed. I caressed the side of his face as we exchanged breaths, moving my paw down his neck and towards his chest, subtly slipping my paw underneath his robe. Skyler began to twitch as I touched the pressure points in his waist, tickling him.

"Charlie..." Sky said with an exhale so breathless that I couldn't even make out my own name.

I was too into it. The mood, the timing, everything felt like it was going so perfectly, and that was making me excited. _Excited, excited._

The moment I moved my paw past his belly button, Sky immediately broke the kiss off with a full-body jolt.

"Charlie." Sky called, causing me to move back.

"Oh, sorry, Sky." I apologized, retracting my hand from his body and laying down on the bed. "I got a little eager."

"You're fine, Charlie." Sky flopped his head to the right, smiling at me. I've never seen him smile so much. He's willing to forgive me for my mistakes a lot more, now.

"I hope I didn't ruin the moment." I laughed awkwardly.

"No, you..." Sky shook his head, staring longingly into my eyes. "I have an idea," He said, getting up from the bed and passing by me. I sat up, wondering what he was up to.

He opened the drawer of his desk and took out the two small bottles of green and red nail polish he bought at the store.

"I'm gonna paint your nails," Sky informed, sitting down on the mattress next to me with his legs crossed.

"What? Sky‚Äî"

"This was the whole reason I bought them, let me paint your nails."

"I thought they were for Claire or Becca‚Äî"

"Face me!" Sky cackled, holding me by the shoulders and turning me in his direction.

"You're lucky that I love you enough to let you do this." I bantered, holding up my paws to Sky and allowing him to take control.

Readily, Sky uncapped the red bottle and took the bristle out slowly. I can't believe he had enough confidence to do this over the blankets. My claws were looking pretty raggedy, so this will, at least, distract people from their deformed shapes.

Cassie once painted my nails. It was the first and only time I ever had my nails painted.

As Sky layered on the nail polish with complete concentration, I couldn't help but remember those times.

I always, sort of, regretted breaking up with her. I always had this overwhelming sense of insecurity when we were apart, like it was a mistake to be leaving her, and that I should go after Cassie because she really was my soulmate.

But, at new times like these, I don't regret leaving her at all.

That chapter's finished. I have a new story to pursue. And that's me and Skyler's.

Moments later, Sky was almost finished. The nail polish had a glittery glow whenever it reflected light and he alternated the colors for each claw so it would be ordered as green, red, green, red, green, red, etc. He had one last claw to paint red.

"Wow, you're really good at this." I marveled, blowing the polish on my right hand, which was already finished, to make the paint dry. "Did you, like, practice on yourself?"

"No, sadly, my claws almost never come out." Sky sighed as he finished coating the last nail with red polish. "They're shy, like me."

"You came out to your parents, I wouldn't call that shy."

"Oh, Charlie..." Sky exhaled, screwing the cap back onto the bottle, looking at me with heartfelt eyes. "I'm so excited."

"For what? Christmas? You've been telling me all week." I said, blowing on my other paw.

"Yes, Christmas." Sky exulted, sliding in closer to my body. "I'm so happy that I get to spend my favorite day of the year with you and my family. You don't know how much this holiday means to me." Loving the way he speaks, I scooched myself in closer to him as well. "I can't wait for you to meet my parents, and, in the right setting." I snorted with laughter. "They're amazing people and I know that they'll love you."

"You sure they won't try to kill me?"

"I'm sure." Sky rolled his eyes, smiling intensely. "Well, I'm sure about my dad, not so confident about my mom." Sky and I both laughed, holding each other in the bed. "You're gonna love them, too, Charlie. You're my family now, whether you like it or not."

I grabbed the sides of Skyler's body and tugged him in, making out with him passionately.

"I don't just _like_ it, Sky," I whispered into his ear.

"Let me guess, you 'love' it."

"You got me."

# 37. SECRET SANTA

\~~~

## Charlie

The moment me and Sky got off work Thursday, we went to the nearby grocery store to find our gifts for Secret Santa.

"Let's see who can find their item, pay for the product, and get out of the store the fastest." Sky challenged as we stood outside of the store by the front sliding doors.

"You're on." I daunted as we both set off into the store at the same time.

We both grabbed a shopping basket from the rack by the entrance, laughing as we stumbled into each other, separating and running off in different directions into the aisles. I immediately absconded to the baking section of the store.

Claire loves to cook. And she's really good at it, too. Like, Alain Ducasse, good. The only reason I know that name is because of how much she talks about and admires him as a chef. She takes culinary classes here at CIVA, and recently she's been learning how to bake. She has been telling me about how baking is new to her, yet fun and exciting. So, I decided to get her something that correlated with her passion. I didn't know exactly what it was that I was gonna get, but my eyes kept looking left and right as I walked down the aisle, trying to find the best gift.

That's when I saw it.

The Refurbished Artisan¬Æ Series 5 Quart Tilt-Head Stand Mixer.

It's a mouthful.

Look it up.

We hadn't put a price limit on our presents. Not that we expected to get really expensive gifts, more like we just forgot. Thankfully, the mixer was on sale and didn't cost as much as it usually does. But, it still took quite a deal out of my pocket.

_Eh, fuck it._

Christmas is a time of spending, and this will probably be the last I buy this holiday season.

And, yes, I already bought Sky a present for Christmas.

I picked up the box with two hands, placing it gently into the basket and swiftly carrying it towards the checkout lanes. Noticing that Sky was already in line for one of them, I snuck into another a few aisles down. We didn't want to see what each of us got, in case I had gotten his name or he had gotten mine. Sadly, the aisle I went into had a pretty long line. I stood there, anxious, wanting to beat Skyler.

Somehow, he had caught me sneaking into another lane. I could see that Sky was subtly mocking me from the other aisle, as he was already one person away from the checkout counter. I stuck the middle finger up at him.

Thankfully, the person in front of him was a slow, elderly lady, and my line was moving pretty quickly. People were in a rush for the holidays. Sky and I left for vacation tomorrow afternoon.

I placed the package on the conveyor belt and walked up to the counter as the employee scanned the item. My leg tapped impatiently as I waited for the employee to bag the mixer and let me pay. I could see Sky also checking out ahead of me. We both simultaneously paid for the item, had it bagged, and exited the lane.

Once we both got out of check out, we stared at each other in the eyes as the exit stood between us. It was like a showdown. At the same time, the two of us bolted for the doors. Sky's a pretty fast runner even though he's pretty short.

Or, he's probably not that short and I'm just really tall. He's like 5'6.

We both knocked into each other, playfully pushing each other out of the way as we stumbled through the sliding doors and shoved ourselves out of the grocery store.

"Me! It was me!" I cheered.

"No, I put my foot through the exit first!" Sky begged to differ.

"Well, I put my snout through first! That's the benefit of having a long muzzle."

"That's not fair!" Sky slapped my arm as he gasped for air.

People must've thought we were insane when we started arguing about who won on the sidewalk.  

We accepted that it was a tie.

The two of us walked back to my car, hand in hand, after the small lover's quarrel was over. I unlocked the trunk and we both placed our bagged presents inside. I tried to sneak a peek at what Sky had bought, the item seemed pretty big and heavy. He was struggling to carry it to the car. I guess I wasn't the only one who went all out.

I bet that we sound like spoiled rich kids, huh?

Sky and I got a head start on packing later that night, hoping that once class was over the next day, we could put our luggage in the car, drive to Amber's, play Secret Santa, and then drive to the airport. That was our whole plan.

Sky couldn't keep his hands off of me as we cuddled the whole night. Not because it was freezing cold, but because he was so happy to spend winter break with me and his family. I've never met someone so excited for Christmas than him. He even wore Christmas pajamas to sleep.

I'm not complaining. I haven't felt this good in a while as well.

Holding Skyler's fragile and cold body as he slept on top of me provided me with the warmth I needed to get through the night. I reached for my camera that was on the bedside table, snapping one last photo of the two of us, a selfie of us resting in the bed.

\~~~

Finally, it was Friday. The day winter break began.

Our teachers and professors were less pressuring than usual, wishing us a happy holidays as we left each class. I walked up to the front of the lecture hall and pinned my laminated photos to the posterboard along with everyone else. We got to see a collage of every photo we all took as a class together on the wall. Mr. Fimognari played a game and tried to make us guess who took what picture. Though I could tell which ones were Kat's and which ones were Rue's, all the photos fit together like a quilt, representing the diversity and ingenuity of the community of CIVA. When I presented my pictures, I couldn't help but think of Sky the whole time. Somehow, the mental image of him waking up in the morning next to me would be the first thing I picture when I think of the word "college".

Sky and I met up at the apartment and brought our luggage to the car. After we finished, we drove over to Amber's with our presents ready. We would play our game of Secret Santa after me and Skyler's shift ended.

Overplayed, yet classic, Christmas songs were playing over the speakers as Sky and I worked our shift. After an hour or two of taking orders and blending holiday specials, Claire, Jonathan, and Becca entered the coffee shop, taking off their coats as they greeted us, and sat down at the couch in the back.

Me and Sky passed on our shift to the ones who worked after us, taking off our aprons and name tags, joining them by the couch. We started with a bit of small talk, chattering about the frighteningly cold temperature and what we'd be doing for the holidays.

And thus, our game of Secret Santa began.

Claire went first. She took out a flat, rectangular box wrapped in rainbow-colored wrapping paper out of her backpack and handed it to Skyler. He unwrapped it carefully to find a 48-watercolor paint set. Sky cherished it, hugging both the palette and then Claire with pure delight. He said that he needed a new set since the one he was using was only 16 colors and was getting messy. Seriously, all the paints were mixing into each other and becoming a brown liquid. I could see it every time he painted.

Then, it was my turn. I whipped out the mixer, and when I tell you Claire screamed, she full-on, Mariah Carey style, screamed. Everyone in the coffee shop looked at her as she began to obsess over the mixer.

"I love how you bought this whole, elaborate, expensive, technological machine for me when my own boyfriend can't even buy me a fucking whisk." Claire mocked, staring excessively at Jonathan. "You know, I should just leave you for Charlie." She teased him.

"Hang on," I gasped, trying not to upset Jonathan.

"Excuse me?!" Skyler wheezed, holding his arm over me like he was shielding me from Claire.  

"You're playing a risky game, babe." Jonathan taunted, staring Claire down.

Then it went to Becca. She had gotten Jonathan a new game for his Nintendo Switch. The game was Animal Crossing: New Horizons. He was pretty ecstatic about it, he even opened the casing and took out the cartridge, examining it closely to see if it was the real deal.

And then it was Jonathan. Turns out he got me. He said he wanted to buy me a new video game like Becca had done, but he decided to get something that I, personally, would've wanted, more than a stupid video game. He took out two boxes of polaroid film since I ran out a few months ago. The photo of Sky's wall when I first entered the apartment was the last photo I took with the polaroid camera. I thanked him for the film as we did a bro hug. The others mocked us for being men. Yes, even Sky did.

Finally, it was Sky's turn. At the end, it was pretty obvious who he had gotten since everyone else had their present. He took out the item that he had bought and handed it to Becca.

"Since I know you love home decor so much," Sky winked at her, putting emphasis on the 'decor'. I don't know why, maybe it was an inside joke. "I got you this cool hexagon shelf thingy! It's assembly-required, so you get to have the enjoyment of building it and applying it to your wall!"

"God, you know I love to decorate," Becca whined, resting her chin on the box as she cradled it lovingly.

They hugged blissfully. It's like Sky is one of the girls and me and Jonathan are the only boys in the friend group.

"Oh, wow," Claire gasped in amazement as she looked out the windows.

Me, Skyler, Jonathan, and Becca turned our heads to see millions and millions of white, glowing snowflakes, falling slowly from the sky and floating down to the ground like thin pieces of silk. We all stared in awe as a winter wonderland began to form outside. People were running down the street, attempting not to get wet. One woman had her mouth open to the sky, trying to catch snowflakes on her tongue. College kids were having a snowball fight in the park across the street, the same place where Sky and I had ours.

I looked at Sky, who was gazing at the snow in an emotional and loving way. I get what he means about Christmas. It's the most enchanting and relaxing time of the year.

"You ready to go, Kitten?" I whispered into his ear.

Sky looked at me with a tenderness in his eyes, an affectionate smile forming across his face.

He nodded.

# 38. HOT CHOCOLATE

\~~~

## Charlie

Sky and I fled out of the coffee shop without the others knowing and ran through the falling snow to the car. We both jumped inside, slamming the doors shut. Sky buckled his seatbelt as I started the car. I put the automobile in motion, turning on the windshield wiper to remove all the flurries of snow from the window.

We drove through the foggy landscape, sprinkled with milk-like-snow that seemed to fall in slow motion, exiting campus and leaving the town of Cloverland. I set directions to the nearby airport on Google Maps as Sky dragged his finger across the faded window. He drew a smiley face.

I picked up Sky's paw and kissed it. He giggled, and in return, kissed my paw as well.

The time had come. I was going to officially, and properly, meet Skyler's parents.

Sky and I ran into the airport, laughing with our luggage towed behind us and our arms interlocked. We sat in the waiting area for a small moment of time since we were a little late, due to the overlong Secret Santa game.

We boarded the plane. Skyler was grateful to have me sitting beside him, alone in the two-seat row. He had told me that he never liked flying alone.

I never liked flying.

"You alright?" Skyler asked me, noticing how tense I seemed.

"Oh, just, flying makes me nervous," I admitted, clenching the sides of the plane seat.

"Aw, really?" Sky worried, placing his paw on my shoulder. "Will you be okay?"

"Yeah, I can handle it," I assured him. "I've only ever ridden an airplane, like, five times in my whole life, so it's always a little new to me. I was never one for traveling."

"With your passion for photography, I would've thought you'd wanted to travel the world with your camera." Sky laughed.

"I like to focus my work on more ordinary places, you know?"

"Like me?"

"You're not ordinary."

"Neither are you."

Sky and I stared deeply into each other's eyes.

The airplane began to shake as it started to take off down the runway, causing me to tense up even more.

"I'll be holding your hand the entire time, okay?" Sky comforted, squeezing my paw tightly.

"Thanks, Kitten." I nodded my head, looking out the window behind him.

The environment outside began to blaze past, and then suddenly, we rose up into the sky. I felt a strange sinking feeling as we left the ground, but Sky's cozy hold on my hand made everything feel better. The ground below seemed to grow smaller the higher we flew.

The sun was setting at that time. Beautiful orange and pink rays of light flashed through the clouds and illuminated the dark spaces of the airplane. It lit up Skyler's face, his pink eyes shining in the glow. He's so beautiful.

I rested my head on Sky's shoulder, knowing that everything would be alright. Sky put his arms around me as I began to drift into sleep.

\~~~

The wheels of the airport taxi crunched in the newly-fallen snow as we pulled up into Sky's driveway. Sky held my hand, trying in all of his power to make me feel the most comfortable I could be.  

It was 11 o'clock at night. It was pitch-black out and extremely chilly, but the sight of Sky's suburban bungalow and the lights turned on inside was drawing me in.

However, I was starting to get worried.

_What if they don't like me?_

_What if it's awkward?_

_What if they see me as a screw-up and not good enough for their son?_

I've never had these thoughts before. I don't even know where they came from. I was so focused on other things that I never considered what they'd think of me.

I mean, I've met them a few times before, but this time, it would be real and authentic. This time, it matters how I present myself because I would most likely be the topic of discussion between Sky and his family.

Sky got out of the car and came around to my side, opening the door. He motioned for me to come out, but something was stopping me.

"Sky?" I asked, looking at the floor. "Are you sure they're gonna like me?"

"Oh, Charlie," Sky empathized, coming closer to me. "Of course, they will. How could they not?"

"I've failed both of my parents," I whimpered, scratching my claws together with anxiety. "What if I fail yours too?"

"Charlie, stop that." Sky scoffed, placing his paws on my cheeks and kissing my forehead. "They'll do nothing but love you, I promise that. I promise."

Sky grabbed my hand and coaxed me out of the car.

We took the luggage out from the trunk and tugged it along. Sky sent the cab away and joined me as we walked up the porch, approaching the front door.

"Are you ready?" Sky questioned as we both stood in front of the closed door.

I took a deep breath.

"Let's do this." I exhaled confidently, fixing my shirt and coat to make myself look the slightest bit more presentable.

"Here we go, then," Sky stated, raising his fist and knocking on the door.

Every second that passed by where no one answered felt like hours on end.

"Okay, so," Sky began. "No curse words, no sexual references, and don't call me adorable. Or any nicknames, whatsoever." I wanted to be vocal with my disappointment, but I didn't want to upset Skyler. "By the way, they're probably gonna be super clingy, so brace yourself." He informed me with a laugh as we waited.

I could see the shadow of someone appear through the curtains of the small square window on the door.

The lock clicked and the door swung open, revealing the person and contents inside.

In the doorway, Sky's mother, Olympia, stood there with a wide grin on her face. She had been expecting us, and for a while. She immediately turned to Skyler.

"Hello, you!" She exclaimed, pulling Sky into a hug.

"Mom!" Sky groaned as he pulled back. Olympia's eyes darted to me in an instant as she gushed with thrill and delight.

"Charlie." She giggled, holding her arms wide open for me. Of course, I had to hug her. I had to lean down in order to do so. Everyone in Sky's family seems to be short, but, again, it could probably be because I'm tall.

"Hi, Mrs. Clawfield!" I greeted as I hugged her.

"Oh, please, call me Olympia. 'Mrs. Clawfield' sounds so dull," She laughed, breaking the hug apart. Sky was right, in the right setting, she can be very bubbly and lovely to be around. Already, my doubts were beginning to melt away. "Come in, come in!"

Accepting Olympia's invitation, I walked into the house. Almost immediately, I felt right at home. It was warm and welcoming and had a family-friendly feel to it. I smiled at the sweetly designed furniture and artsy home decor choices. It almost looked as if every student in an art class each designed a wall by themselves. It was messy in a way that was vibrant and unique. They didn't care what others thought about how their home looked, they did what they wanted with it. They had already decorated for Christmas. Wreaths were littered over the walls and a big, grand, Christmas tree stood in the center of the living room, tangled in bright lights, ornaments colored gold and silver, and a shiny, glowing star on top. Parts of the leaves were sprinkled over the floor, revealing that they had chopped down an actual spruce tree, showing their dedication to the holidays.

My dad almost never decorated. Nor did I ever get presents or celebrate the holiday.

But, now, I finally can.

Thanks to Skyler.

"Give me your coat," Sky requested. I handed him my heavy, damp jacket and he took it down the hallway towards the closet.

"Your house is very nice, Mrs‚ÄîI mean Olympia," I complimented as she came back into the living room.

"Why, thank you, Charlie!" She responded, making quick adjustments to the furniture. I could tell she was as nervous as me as she tidied things up.

"Charlie's here?" I heard Skyler's father call from the kitchen. He walked into the living room, taking in the sight of me. "Ah, Charlie! Good to see you again!" He did a little bow and held his hand out. I shook it, happily. Skyler joined my side, blushing from embarrassment.  

"So, how about I whip us up some hot cocoa while we sit down and get to know about you two, huh?" Thompson asked.

"That would be nice," I said, glancing back at Sky again.

"C'mon, sit, Charlie!" Olympia encouraged, sitting down in one of the two armchairs that stood next to the couch.

Skyler took me by the hand and led me to the big couch that stood in the middle of the living room, directly in front of the Christmas tree. Sky sat down on the cushion, gesturing me to join him.

Unaware of how affectionate I should be to Sky around his parents, I awkwardly sat beside him. Sky could see that I didn't know how to behave, holding my hand again. Every time he held my hand, I got a rush of confidence. It was like he was telepathically messaging me, saying, 'Everything is going to be okay.'

After a few minutes, Thompson came out with four Christmas mugs of hot chocolate for the four of us. I was amazed by how quickly it took him to brew it. Sky took two glasses of hot chocolate and handed me one. I took a sip. It was piping hot, but eventually, I adapted to it.

"Woah, this is really good!" I beamed.

"Dad's hot chocolate is always the best." Sky commented, which made Thompson smile.

"Been doing it for years." He replied.

"So, let's just get it over with," Olympia said, crossing her arms. Sky rolled his eyes, squeezing my paw again. This time he was saying, 'Get ready'. "How long have you two been together?" She interrogated excitedly, like a teenage girl wanting to learn new gossip from her best friends.

"About... two and a half months?" I estimated, looking at Sky for approval. He nodded his head.

"We met on the first day of college," Sky added.

"How has college been for you two, anyway?" Sky's dad wondered. "I mean, after the... you know."

"It's been okay." Sky said, looking down at his mug.

Sky's mom looked saddened. I don't blame her.

"But, Charlie's been super supportive and helpful, so I'm not complaining." Skyler beamed, looking at me with appreciation.

Every time we looked into each other's eyes, it was like a connection that only we could feel. A signal that only we understood. He could look into my eyes and barely say anything and I would know exactly what he's going through. Right now, I could tell he wanted to say a million thank you's, wishing he could somehow make up for everything I've done for him. He squeezed my hand once again. 'I'm so thankful to have you here.'

"So, Charlie," Thompson began. "Tell us about yourself."

I turned my head back to Sky, who nodded, giving me the courage to be open about myself.

"Well, uh, I do photography," I explained, looking at his parents proudly.

"Oh, really?" Olympia indulged. "Tell me about that."

"Yeah, I've been doing it for years," I elaborated. "I, uh, at a young age, I always loved the way the world looks and I've always wanted a way to capture certain feelings or certain moments forever. That way, you can look back on it, clearly, and dissect it as much as you want."  

Olympia and Thompson nodded their heads, looking at each other with a sense of appreciation.

"I wish I could take a photo right now," I laughed, causing his parents to laugh as well.

I made his parents laugh.

'They approve of you,' Skyler's paw spoke to me.  

"But, yeah," I continued, not worrying whether I'm speaking too much or too little. "My passion fully and completely surrounds the camera. I've always adored using it in different and unique ways, unlike regular, everyday photographers who just want to take a photo to get paid, no, I want my photos to say something. I want them to be interesting, something you can stare at for hours and discover something new in them each minute that passes."

I didn't care about how much I was describing my work. My father never bothered to listen when I tried to tell him. Instead, Sky's parents were focused, intrigued, hooked. They loved hearing about my passion and they actually had things to say about it.

Me, Thompson, and Olympia spent the next few minutes discussing photography and cinematography and how it relates to me and my future. Sky just sat there, holding my hand, in complete and utter peace. It delighted him to see me expressing myself to his family and his family expressing themself to me, without him ever having to say anything.

It was as if I were a part of their family all along.

Skyler squeezed my hand once more.

  

'I love you, so much.'

  

"Hey, does Charlie want to look around?" Thompson suggested.

"That would be great," I said, looking at Skyler. He got up, set his empty glass of hot chocolate on the coffee table, and held his hand out to me.

"Wanna see my room?" Sky invited, excitedly.

Enticed, I took his hand.


# 39. CALICO

\~~~

## Charlie

I followed Skyler as he got up and walked through the doorway that led to the hallway. I waved to his parents as we disappeared down the hall. It reminded me of the apartment's hallway, there were multiple doors on each wall and had a fluffy, white carpet on the floor. But, of course, the Clawfields had their own little spin on it. They had painted each door a different image or pattern; one door displayed a beach with an endless ocean, another showed a detailed depiction of the busy streets and neon signs of New York City. The door at the end of the hall represented the sky. It showed a bright, pink and blue sunset, with clouds scattered across the painting, and birds soaring through the air.

I could only guess it was Skyler's.

Before we could even come close to the door, something stopped us.

That was the moment I heard a small, high-pitched voice come from behind me.

"Sky!" It spoke.

It sounded nothing like Sky's parents. I turned around in confusion to find a small, baby calico cat, dressed in blue pajamas and a stuffed elephant hanging from his paw, standing in the middle of the hallway. He looked to be about nine or ten years old.

_Who's this tiny kitten?_

"Cal, go back to bed," Skyler suddenly spoke up in a calm and quiet manner.

"You're back!" The calico sparkled with glee. It looked as though he wanted to run up and give Sky a big hug.

"Of course, I'm back," Sky lowered to his knees, reaching the same height as the kitten. "I promised I'd be back for Christmas, didn't I?"

"You promised that _you_ would be back, I dunno who this is." The calico cat said, looking up at me.

"We'll talk in the morning, Cal. It's 11 PM, way past your bedtime."

"I'm not tired."

"You will be if you don't get your rest," Sky responded. "Trust me, I know."

"Who is that?" Cal pointed at me, completely ignoring what Sky had said to him.

"This is Charlie," Sky introduced, standing back up and putting his hands on my shoulder and back.

Sure, I was confused, but this 'Cal' dude was adorable, just like Skyler. I knelt down and held out my hand.

"Hi!" I greeted.

Cal looked at my hand suspiciously and crossed his arms.

"I don't know you," Cal sassed.

"Charlie's... a friend," Sky hesitated. I looked back at him with a smirk on my face.

"What is he doing here?" Cal asked, scanning me up and down.

"He's going to spend Christmas with us." Sky answered. I could tell by the tone of his voice that he was hoping Cal would like me.

Cal looked personally annoyed, but then he shrugged it off like he was uninterested. He seemed pretty uptight for a little kid.

"Whatever, Clouds," Cal grunted, marching back to his room. He entered the third door on the right. It was painted to look like outer space.

I stood up and turned to Sky, searching for answers.

"Clouds is just a nickname he calls me," Sky stalled, awkwardly shifting his feet.

"That's not the answer I'm looking for," I told him.

Skyler sighed. He opened the sky-painted door and gestured me to come in.

"Let's talk about it." He spoke, disappearing into the room.

I walked into Sky's bedroom. It was exactly how I'd imagined it to be. If there was ever a room that resembled someone so much that the person would literally blend into its environment, this is it. Every wall was occupied with something, whether it was blue and pink paint, a collage of pictures, banners, lights, writings, everything. It was like he made it a goal to fill up every empty surface of his room. His desk sat to the left of the room, adorned with sketchbooks and other art equipment he didn't bring to college. I could notice color stains on the desk that were most likely the result of furious painting. His bed was barely big enough for two, but the blankets were furry and delicate, and each pillow had a different pattern and shape. One was literally a strawberry-frosted, rainbow-sprinkled donut. Above the bed was a massive collage of printed photos that were Scotch-taped to the wall, showing his variety of interests. Applied to the mantle of the bed were, of course, Skyler's signature fairy lights. His bedroom both matched and clashed at the same time. It reminded me of Skyler's manic personality, which also reminded me of how much I love him. It's weird, I would've imagined that he'd take this all down once he went to college...

"His name is Calico," Sky confessed, closing the door behind us. "He's my adopted baby brother."

"He's adopted?" I whipped around after being distracted by the creative interior. "Sky, why didn't you tell me, that's amazing! You said you had no siblings."

"Charlie..." Sky said solemnly, as if I wasn't getting the point. "He's autistic."

"Oh," I stuttered, my smile dropping for a few seconds. I was caught off guard. "Well, that's okay!" I immediately followed, returning my smile.

"Yeah, I know." Sky deadpanned, looking down.

"What's wrong?" I asked him, curiously. "Why didn't you tell me, Sky?"

"My parents," Sky sat down on the bed, getting ready for a story. "They adopted him when he was only five. His other family, they were jerks. Threw him out like an old pair of clothing. Of course, adopting an autistic child brought up my parents' popularity. They were in the newspaper and everything. Everyone just wanted to hear what it was like to save and raise a child on the spectrum. They were considered heroes, and, yes, they deserved it."

"But?" I allured, joining him on the bed.

"But, from then on," He continued, "My parents focused on him mostly. Remember how I said that they didn't seem to notice when I was struggling?" I nodded, holding his paw as a gesture of comfort. "Probably, because they were too busy taking care of Calico. A-And, that's not a complaint‚ÄîOf course, I supported them. I still do. I loved Calico. He was amazing. Him and I had such a dynamic friendship. But, then, I read the original newspaper that discussed the adoption, and it read that Calico was the Clawfield's first and only child. People just believed that my parents were raising Cal on his own, and not that there was another twelve-year-old in the household."

"Oh," I whispered, placing my hand on Sky's leg.

"That led to a lot of self-doubt on my part. I started thinking, am I good enough? I became lonely and isolated, which led to my depression, and... you understand the rest. I never told my parents about how I felt because I didn't want to upset them. They had enough to deal with on their own. Trust me, Calico was adorable, but..."

Skyler suddenly shut his mouth, afraid he had said something that would've been considered derogatory. He covered his mouth with his paw, looking at me with fear.

"I decided not to tell you I had a brother because... because..." Sky attempted to speak through his miniature panic attack.

"Skyler," I tried to get his attention.

"I'm selfish, I know," Sky whimpered, fiddling with his hands.

"No, Sky, you're not selfish,"

"Yes, I am, I lied to you,"

"Sky, listen," I spoke, holding him, trying to calm him down. "It may sound selfish, but it's okay to hide sometimes. Trust me, I know exactly how it feels when your parents don't seem to notice you. Just because you didn't tell me about your brother, doesn't make you selfish. You love him, and he loves you. That's all that matters."

Sky relieved himself of his doubts, exhaling deeply and grabbing my paw tightly.

"Come here," I encouraged, pulling him into an embrace.

"He's only nine," Sky muttered, pushing his small face into my chest.

\~~~

I unpacked my clothes and placed them on Skyler's bed, which Sky then organized into an empty drawer by his desk. Skyler's mother popped her head in. It was 12 AM at the moment, so it was probably to say goodnight.

"All set, Charlie?" She asked me, looking around to see how I was adjusting.

"Yup, I got everything unpacked for the week." I smiled.

"Alright!" She beamed, withdrawing her head from the doorway, making me believe Sky and I were alone again.

In contradiction to my beliefs, she came right back in with a giant air mattress, already blown-up.

"What's the mattress for?" I asked. Sky glanced at me, silently wincing.

"For you! Who else?" Olympia said, shoving the mattress into the room. "What, are you guys planning on having intercourse?" She joked, causing me to blush.

"Mom!" Sky huffed, his face going red.

"Kidding!" Olympia said with a sing-song voice. She moved between us and placed the mattress on the floor on the left side of the bed, tossing on some sheets and pillows.

"How's that?" Sky's mom beamed, putting her hands on her hips.

_Olympia is so goofy and featherbrained, I wish I had a mom like her._

_I wish I had a mom at all._

"It's perfect," I approved with content, smiling at her.

"Great!" She squealed, heading for the door. "It's wonderful to have you here, Charlie. Enjoy your stay."

"Thank you," I called out to her. "It's wonderful to be here."

"Love to hear it!" Olympia chortled. "Alright, you two, no funny business!"

"Oh, my god, Mom!" Sky whined, covering his face in embarrassment.

"Goodnight, sweetheart." She said to Skyler. "Goodnight, Charlie." She said to me.

She closed the door behind her. Sky turned around and began to laugh as soon as we were alone.

"I'm sorry about that." He cowered, coming towards me and pulling me into a hug.

"I have to sleep on that thing?" I cringed, staring at the air mattress as Sky held me tightly.

"Yeah," Sky consoled, releasing his embrace and placing his paws on my shoulders. "It's just for the week. Do you think you'll manage?"

"I'm sure I'll survive," I smirked.

"My parents are very religious," Sky scoffed, patting me on the back. "So even sleeping in the same bed before marriage is a big no-no for them."

Sky walked over to a small door in his bedroom that led to his bathroom.

"Got your toothbrush?" Sky asked while flicking on the bathroom lights.

"Of course," I said, taking my bag of toiletries out of my suitcase.

We brushed our teeth together and got ready for bed. I took off my clothes while Sky changed into his pajamas in the small bathroom. I don't understand how he can sleep with clothes on without getting overheated.

_Sure, it's winter, but, damn, my body heats up real quick when I try to sleep._

Sky opened the door and came out dressed in blue and green Christmas pajamas.

"Aww, you're always so adorable." I swooned, wanting to pinch his cheeks.

"Hey, that word is forbidden, remember?" He reminded, walking past me.

"But, we're alone together, I can call you whatever I want. Like, my bitch," I teased, resting my head up against the wall, taking in the sight of him.

"Hey!" Sky exasperated, climbing into his bed.

Skyler got under the covers and laid down on his right side. I watched as he snuggled up into the pillows, curling into a tiny ball. I couldn't stop smiling at him.

"What?" Sky moaned in between a yawn.

"You're beautiful, you know that?" I expressed, sitting down on the air mattress beside his bed.

"I know because you've said it a thousand times." He bantered softly, ready for sleep to take him fully.

"Probably because I mean it." I cooed, sitting up close to his bed and caressing the soft fur on his face. Skyler began to purr fondly, taking in the gentle feeling of my paw on his face.

"We should probably go to sleep now," Sky slurred, slowly grabbing my hand and squeezing it. He looked pretty tired.

"I don't think I can handle sleeping without you in my arms." I flirted, kissing his forehead.

"Shut up..." Sky said listlessly, trying to stay awake.

"You really are sleepy." I marveled, brushing my paw down from his face to the side of his body, stroking back and forth.

"It's just something about my own bed that makes me so tired..."

I laid down on the mattress, which was surprisingly comfy, as Sky reached to turn off the lamp next to his bed. One click and the room went dark. I looked up at the glow-in-the-dark stars and planet stickers on his ceiling. Somehow, Sky has made me feel more comfortable sleeping in his room than the one I have been living in for the past twenty years.

_Everything about this felt so... perfect._

_Except..._

"Just come up here," Sky whispered, breaking the silence.

_There we go._

"You read my mind," I chuckled, climbing up and crawling under the covers.

"Only for ten minutes," Sky murmured.

"Only for ten minutes," I repeated.

As soon as I got in, he immediately hugged me tightly. His bed was even more comforting than the mattress. The pillows were soft and the blankets were fluffy and pleasing. Holding Sky in my arms was the best part of it all. It felt like such an honor to be here with him, to be holding him in the bed he grew up in for the eighteen years of his life. Sky was as soft and fragile as he always was.

He opened his eyes and looked into mine.

"You know," He whispered, "When I was about fifteen or sixteen, I'd always wonder if, someday, I'd have someone else in this bed here with me. I'd imagine that they would be dreamy, loving, and all-around perfect."

"Am I anything you expected?" I asked him, squeezing his waist.

"Not even close," Sky chuckled wearily. He snuggled in closer and burrowed his head into my neck.

"I love you." He whispered into my ear.

"I love you, too, Whiskers," I whispered back.

  

That's when the bedroom door suddenly opened. Sky jolted out of my arms and sat up abruptly to see who was in the doorway. I got up and peered over his head to see the small figure standing in the light of the hallway.

"I had a bad dream," said the baby Calico, barging in and closing the door behind him.

"Cal!" Sky yelped, "What are you doing?"

"What are you doing in bed with a boy?" Cal asked Sky.

"Nothing, Cal, please leave." Sky pleaded.

"Are you gay?" Cal interrupted.

"Calico!"

"If you are, that's fine," Cal spoke while climbing into the bed.

"Cal, stop!" Sky whined as he snuggled in between us. I couldn't help but giggle, Cal was the cutest kitten I've ever seen, and I have been dating Skyler for almost three months.

"I had a bad dream and I'm sleeping here," Cal reasoned, lying down in the bed.

"No, you are not." Sky debated.

"You always let me sleep here whenever I'm scared!" Cal mewled, feebly slamming his paws on the mattress.

"Not tonight, Cal, please."

"I get that you want to sleep with your boyfriend, but I just had a traumatizing experience, man! Give me a break!"

I began to chuckle out loud. Calico is something else.

"Cal..." Sky sighed, rubbing his forehead.

"Look, if you let me stay, I promise I won't tell Mom and Dad you guys were having sex." Cal assured.

"CALICO!" Sky screeched, while keeping his voice down at the same time. I couldn't help but wheeze with laughter. "Where did you learn that word?!"

"What? Just because I'm a-tistic, doesn't mean I'm dumb!" Cal crossed his arms, looking at me and shaking his head. I playfully shook my head as well, teasing Skyler.

"Cal, It's pronounced 'au-tistic'." Sky rectified. "Besides, you know I'm not like that."

Calico nodded softly, understanding what he meant by that.

"Whatever, Clouds." He dismissed, instinctively latching his limbs onto Skyler, causing Sky to lay back down in the bed. I laid down beside them as well.

Sky looked up at me with eyes full of regret. He mouthed the words 'I'm so sorry...' to me.

I smiled, petting Cal's forehead. Somehow, he was out cold. I mouthed back to Skyler, 'I love him.' Skyler released a lethargic sigh of relief, thankful that Calico didn't disrupt anything between us.

We both looked at each other as we laid in the bed. I wrapped my left arm around Sky and caressed his face with my right once more as he closed his eyes. Knowing that Sky was okay made me feel at peace.

The three of us slept through the night, unharmed and unseen. From that moment on, I knew that this would be a magical Christmas vacation.¬†

# 40. SNOWFLAKE

\~~~

## Skyler

Christmas Eve.

I woke up in my comfortable and cozy bed to the smell of bacon and eggs cooking from the kitchen. Expecting Calico to be in my arms from last night, I felt around to find he wasn't there anymore. I opened my eyes to see Charlie, awake, looking longingly at the tiny kitten snoozing on top of his chest, petting him softly as not to wake him. I exhaled soft laughter, causing Charlie to look at me.

"I guess he likes you," I whispered, nuzzling the tip of my nose to his.

"He's so adorable," Charlie gushed, keeping his voice low. "And I'm allowed to use that word because I'm not referring to you in this sentence."

I rolled my eyes.

"He's never this friendly," I scoffed, resting my head into Charlie's neck. "He's usually pretty scary."

We both softly snickered.

"I can hear you two, you know," Cal suddenly spoke out loud.

Charlie and I froze. My eyes widened. Cal was awake and listening the whole time.

I can't blame him, even when awake I never want to leave Charlie's chest.

"I-I'm sorry, Cal." I stuttered, horrified that he might hate me.

"Whatever, Clouds," He snapped back, still resting on Charlie's tummy. "Your boyfriend's more comfortable to sleep on. But, I think you know that already."

My mouth fell open. Charlie looked at me with an expression that made it seem like he was about to burst with laughter. Cal got up from Charlie's stomach and onto the floor.

"I'm hungry." He said as he left the room.

Me and Charlie looked at each other.

"I'm truly amazed," Charlie said sarcastically as I climbed over him.

"Welcome to my world," I whispered, connecting my mouth to his as I laid atop his body.

I separated our lips by an inch to stare at him for a few moments. He's so perfect, even in the morning.

"What?" Charlie asked.

"Just... taking in the sight of you." I smiled so widely it felt as though our teeth were touching.

I slipped out from under the covers and got up from the bed, tugging Charlie's arm for him to follow.

We stumbled out into the hallway and into the living room. My dad was sitting in his favorite armchair, drinking coffee and reading the newspaper. Clich√©, but it's totally who he is. Calico ran to the dining table and sat down. My mom came into the living room from the kitchen with plates stacked in colorful breakfast items. The dining table itself was an array of assorted goods, bright yellow scrambled eggs, toasted rare bacon, sausages, pancakes, waffles, oozing syrup... My mom really went all out.

"Your hair is a little messy," My mom said, placing the plates on the table before waddling over to me and licking her paw to flatten my stuck-up fur.

"Mom, stoppit..." I mumbled, pushing her hand away in embarrassment.

Charlie jokingly placed his paw on my head as my mom went away.

Me and Charlie sat down next to each other as my mom took more plates from the kitchen and placed them on the table. The sun shined through the windows and fell over the food. Oddly, it felt like I was in a commercial, but I dug into the eggs and bacon anyway.

"I made it extra special for our extra special guest." My mom beamed, eyeing Charlie. She sat down at the end of the table. "Say, how was the mattress, Charlie? Not too uncomfortable I hope?"

Calico choked on his food, wanting to fizzle with laughter.

I shot a death glare at him.

"Y-yeah, it-it was good." Charlie stuttered.

"Well, would you look at that," My dad said, staring out the window, unintentionally changing the subject.

"Pardon?" My mom responded.

"The snow." My dad gawked.

Calico got up from the table and ran to the window, glowing with light from the outside, to see the winter wonderland made up of sprinkled snow, coating the landscape. It was approximately about 24 inches deep. It looked like powdered sugar, like the kind that Mom shook over the pancakes she made.

"Ooh! Can we go outside, Mommy?" Calico bubbled excitedly, jumping up and down.

"Eat your breakfast first!" She answered, patting the seat of the tiny chair. "How is it, Sky?"

"It's delicious, Mommy," I said softly, twisting the fork in my paw.

"Yeah, it's really good," Charlie spoke in-between bites.

"So, Sky and Charlie," My dad called, Calico riding on his shoulders. "Think you can take Cal out to the park for a little while? Have fun in the snow?"

"That'd be awesome!" Charlie beamed. "But, first, I gotta shower and freshen up," He said, running back into my room, leaving the plate completely clean. He's definitely a husky by blood.

"Okay! Wait for me..." My voice fizzled out, knowing Charlie probably couldn't hear me from my room. I followed my mom as she returned to the kitchen with empty plates. "Mom?" I whispered.

"Yes, dear?" She asked with a smile.

"What..." I hesitated, my face getting hot. "What do you think of him?"

My mom looked at me with caring eyes, the type of eyes that someone uses on you when they want to tell you they love you a million times, placing her hands on my shoulders.

"I think he's absolutely lovely," She whispered back, an expression on her face that made it seem like she was about to cry tears of joy. "I'm so happy for you."

I smiled. A sense of relief rushed through me, knowing that everything would be okay. Everything would be okay from now on.

I walked back into my room to hear the water running and Charlie whistling from behind the bathroom door. I placed my head up against the door, waiting for my turn.

After rinsing off and drying my fur, I joined Charlie, who was waiting patiently on my bed.

"We should shower together, saves more time." He smirked.

"Shut up."

We went back into the living room to put on our coats and gloves. I bent down to help Calico with his tiny jacket and beanie. We had matching hats. I held hands with him and Charlie as we opened the door. The feeling of the cold, yet calming breeze of winter hit us, and I felt like I was officially home... and with the people I love.

The three of us waved goodbye to Mom and Dad and headed in the direction of the nearby playground. It was completely abandoned but a junkyard for fresh snow. Calico ran ahead and scooped up some snow, forming it into a ball. He threw it at me, laughing. I formed another snowball in retaliation. Just like that time with me and Charlie, another epic snowball fight occurred. We all went at it, throwing rapid blazing orbs of frozen rain at each other. We dodged, hit, and fled everywhere. It was fun to use some of the playground equipment as reinforcements or shields. There was a moment where both Calico and Charlie attacked me, tackling me to the ground and tickling me like maniacs. Charlie definitely fits in.

Then the snow started to fall harder. Calico mentioned how the area looked like something from a romance movie. We started to dance, laugh, and taste the snowflakes as it fell on our tongues. Calico became obsessed with how slippery the slide was when it was covered in snow. Charlie and I sculpted snow angels on the icy floor.

"For someone who's always freezing cold, why is winter your favorite season?" Charlie asked me as we both laid on the soft and melty surface of the ground.

It took me a bit to process the question. He was right. I haven't been feeling supremely chilly like I always do.

"I guess I meant a different kind of cold," I vacillated, staring into Charlie's hazel eyes. He nodded his head, somehow understanding what I meant even though I didn't.

"You and your brother really love to play in the snow."

"Winter was the time where Cal and I bonded the most," I told him, smiling over past Christmases. Another snowflake fell on top of my nose. Charlie stared at it, giggling.

"Your new nickname is now Snowflake." He said.

"Why do you have so many nicknames for me?"

"Because it's cute. And you're cute. And couples usually have nicknames for each other. So I'm gonna name you Snowflake for now until I find another nickname." He said, kissing my forehead and getting up off the ground.

"And I thought 'Kitten' irritated me," I grunted. Charlie held his hand out and helped me to my feet.

Retaining my balance, I looked around for Calico.

  

He wasn't at the slide.

  

"Where's Calico?" I said, my heart suddenly dropping.

"Calico?" Charlie called out.

_Where did he go?_

My heart began to beat faster and faster. My nerves started to act up and my limbs began to twitch. I looked around. He was nowhere. Charlie ran around the outskirts of the park only to find nothing.

"Calico? CALICO!" I screamed, my whole body diving deep into fear.

I felt like crying. Even though I promised myself not to, I really did feel like immediately breaking down like a dramatic parent who lost their child in an Oscar-nominated masterpiece. I'd kill myself if I ever lost Calico. He's my responsibility and my brother.

He's my family.

The wind began to pick up and the snow began to rain down harsher.

Now it was starting to feel cold.

Not breezy cold. Achingly cold.

My eyes locked onto tiny footprints in the snow, following them. Charlie raced after me. The snow began to fall harder as I started to lose sight of the environment. Everything was transforming into a humongous blur with the fog. The footprints traced over a hill and down a path. I couldn't see ahead. I couldn't hear Charlie shouting my name behind me. I was entirely focused on finding Calico. It was like my life depended on it. Because it did. He is my life. I wouldn't be anyone without him, or mom, or dad, or... Charlie.

"CALICO!" I yelled once more, fighting the blazing wind as the snow began to whisk away the trodden footprints. I ran ahead, following the general direction of where the prints were heading.

I could see a small figure.

I raced towards it with hope.

I screamed Calico's name once more. Cal turned around and looked at me, confused. I slid into the snow and scooped him up. I hugged him tightly, breathing raspily into his shoulder.

"What's wrong with you?" Cal asked, trying to escape my embrace.

"Where were you?" I worried, grasping him by his arms.

"I was just trying to go to the bathroom. There was a porta-potty by the sidewalk." He explained.

"You do not go off by yourself without my permission," I demanded, sticking my finger out at him. "I could have lost you!"

"How could you have lost me?"

"Well, one, you could've died from the freezing temperature, two, you could've walked into the street without seeing where you were going and get hit by a car!" I poured out of my mouth without thinking. I could hear Charlie catching up behind me. Cal started to tug the fur on the back of his head.

"I'm sorry, Sky..." Cal whimpered, looking down. He looked like he was about to cry. I sighed, angry at myself for yelling at him.

"Come here," I said, pulling him into another hug. "I'm sorry, too."

"Why can't I ever be smart..?" Cal sulked.

"Hey, you're smart," I told him, placing my paws on his cheeks. "Your one of the smartest nine-year-olds I know. Trust me, kids these days can be total idiots. You have a mind of your own."

Cal smiled at me.

"Just... never walk off without asking me," I pleaded, patting his head.

"How can I do that when you're not here?" Cal whined. "You've been gone for so long, I don't know how I can be without you."

"You have Mom and Dad, silly," I said, catching my breath from all the running.

"But they don't get me like you do." Cal stammered. "You're my best friend. And I've felt so lonely these past months."

"Well, Cal..." I chuckled, "I do have a life of my own. I have to go to college so I can grow and learn, just like you. I have important friends to talk and care to, like you do." I turned around to look at Charlie. The sides of his mouth curled up as his eyebrows furrowed. He was relieved that Cal was safe. It seemed he cared for the kitten as much as I did.

Cal looked up at me and frowned.

"Look, Cal," I started, holding his paws. "Life is hard. Life is really, really hard. But sometimes, you just have to push through. Trust me, so many people are going to tell you that. The people you see in movies will tell you that. It's basically common knowledge. But what you do need to know is that I love you. No matter how far I am, I will never stop loving you."

Cal's smile returned.

"Now, c'mon. It's freezing, let's go home." I said, grunting as I picked him up and lugged him over my shoulder.

We started down the path to the house.

Charlie put his hand around my waist and squeezed tightly.

I could tell he was proud of me. I don't know why.

It's our telepathic connection.

\~~~

Later that night, we all watched a Christmas movie. Cal didn't dare to tell my parents what had happened. It was me, Cal's, and Charlie's little secret. Charlie and I squeezed into the armchair that was to the right of the flat-screen TV. Luckily, we both fit. That way, I could cuddle up to him during the boring parts of the film. My mom had made stove-popped popcorn, so I playfully tossed a few kernels into Charlie's mouth, missing the first time, but hitting the second and third time. I didn't care if my family was watching me act so smitten. I came to spend time with them, so that's what I'm doing.

I tucked Cal into bed and kissed him goodnight. He drifted into sleep quickly, it was a long day. I could tell he wouldn't be barging in on us again tonight.

Me and Charlie snuck back into my bedroom and got ready for sleep, the same way we did last night. Again, Charlie begged to sleep with me, so I allowed it.

"A few more minutes 'til Christmas," Charlie notified while climbing under the blankets. I looked at the clock on my bedside table to see it read 11:58.

Once Charlie snuggled in, he hugged me tightly.

"Ugh, what now?" I scoffed, placing my paw on his head and yawning once again.

"I'm proud of you, snowflake." He whispered in my ear.

_Called it._

"Why?" I asked sarcastically, as if he were waiting for me to ask.

"You're so incredible." He professed, looking deep into my eyes.

"No, I'm not," I murmured, slowly and steadily falling into rest.

"Yes, you are," Charlie spoke, "I've never met someone like you. I feel so happy. I feel... so proud. So proud to be here, in your house, your room, your bed. Your house is so warm and inviting. It almost feels like I don't deserve any of it. I feel so proud that I get to hold you... and call you my boyfriend."

"Charlie..." I said, opening my eyes. "I'm happy you're here. You make me feel so loved."

"You make me feel so lucky."

"You're the best gift I could ever ask for," I whispered, closing my eyes and nestling into Charlie's chest. He wrapped his arms around me and, finally, I felt safe again. No more worries.

"I love you." I moaned, letting my energy drain out.

"I love you, too."

Charlie turned around to see the clock on my nightstand. 11:59.

  

"Merry Christmas, snowflake."

# 41. CHRISTMAS

\~~~

## Charlie

Christmas day.

We finally made it.

I knew I was awake before I decided to open my eyes.

I could smell newly wrapped presents, a warm yule log roasting in the fireplace, and fresh snow just outside the window. I could taste gingerbread and peppermint chocolate in the air.

I'm allowed to exaggerate my senses since they were tied to my festive feelings. It was Christmas day. Christmas. Day.

I opened my eyes, my muzzle nestled comfortably on Skyler's chest. I couldn't help but notice how soft and silky his t-shirt was, allowing me to sense his fragile figure underneath the thin layer of clothing. He's a delicate oddity, but he's mine. My whole body laid upon his, my arms wrapped around Sky, snuggling closely. I picked my head up, watching over my sleeping kitten, hoping I didn't suffocate him. But he was sleeping like an angel.

I really didn't want to have to ruin this precious moment, but it was already too late in the morning of Christmas day.

I sprang up out of bed, placing my paws on his shoulders, shaking him violently and playfully.

"WAKE UP, IT'S CHRISTMAS!" I pretended to shout, mimicking an 11-year-old excited to open presents.

"Ah!" Sky yelped, his eyes wide open as I shook him.

"Merry Christmas, Snowflake," I smiled at him, pushing him down into the bed, kissing his lips and neck repeatedly.

"Merry Christmas, Charlie," He laughed, ticklish to my kisses, brushing me away.

Skyler sat up in bed, instantly pulling me into a hug.

We both looked out Skyler's window as we held each other to see the snow falling, once again, in the beauty of pure daylight. It felt as though I was in a Christmas Hallmark movie where everything was perfect and happy. It never snowed where I lived.

The sound of Sky's door abruptly slamming open came from behind us.

"Sky! Santa came!" Cal barged into Sky's room for the second time in a row. "Quit cuddling and come on! Come on!"

"Hold your horses, give me a second." Sky yawned, climbing out of bed. Cal disappeared from the doorway and ran to the living room.

Sky turned around and grabbed my shoulder, pulling me out of bed. He tossed me clothes to wear since it would definitely be awkward if I opened presents with his family wearing only my boxers.

"Let's open some presents." He whispered to me, trailing me towards the door.

We walked down the carpeted hallway in our socks and pajamas. We could hear Cal yelling at his parents to wake up in another room down the hall. Skyler held my hand tightly as we entered the cozy living room to see presents and gifts wrapped in sparkling red, green, and gold fabric, underneath the bright and shiny lights of the Christmas tree.

Cal ran in behind us, dragging in Olympia and Thompson who were somehow fully awake. They must've been the ones who lit the fireplace, going back to sleep to give Cal the joy of stomping over them in their beds.  

"Woah!" Cal beamed, his eyes widening. He shoved between me and Sky, racing to find which presents were his.

Me and Sky laughed and sat down on the couch while Olympia attempted to calm Cal down.

"So, presents or breakfast first?" Thompson asked, staring at all of us.

Cal gave Thompson a puppy-eye look that screamed 'presents, now!' Thompson nodded his head.

"Now, we didn't get as many presents as last year since we've been kinda low on money," Olympia whispered to Sky.

"It's okay, mom," Sky whispered back. "As long as Cal and Charlie are happy."

I'm more than happy. I don't care how many presents Sky and Cal get, even if I don't get any at all, like I usually did every Christmas with my father. I'm just happy that I get to spend an actual Christmas with Sky and his family.

I placed my hand on his shoulder and he looked back at me with a lightheartedness in his eyes. He's so fucking beautiful. He's so fucking adorable.

He's, just... perfect.

"Who's going first?" Thompson asked, rubbing his paws together.

"Me! Me! Me!" Cal hyped, already reaching for a present.

"That one's from me," Sky smiled at Cal, nodding to the gift wrapped in red.

He unwrapped it, throwing the ripped-up wrapping paper into a trash bag that Sky's dad had brought in. Sky had gotten him a journal. Cal looked astonished. He got up and jumped into Sky's lap and gave him a giant hug.

"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Sky!" He exulted.

"You're welcome! Now get off!" Sky laughed, picking Cal up and placing him on the carpet. "He wants to be a writer," Sky whispered into my ear, giving me context.

"With his mind, I can't imagine what stories he'd tell," I whispered back.

"Sky," Olympia called, handing him a small golden gift. "You're next, honey."

Sky opened the gift slowly and gave the ripped paper to Thompson.

Inside was a folded up pride flag in a plastic bag.

"Wow, mom." Sky jested, blushing profoundly at the item.

"What, do you not like it?" Sky's mom chuckled.

"No, I love it!" Sky cringed, covering his face with his paw and hugging the folded-up flag. "But, jeez, these feels like almost too much. Mom, Dad, I get that you want me to feel comfortable, but you don't have to fully force yourself into it. You can take it slow, allow yourself to adjust‚Äî"

"I just don't want you to feel like you can't express yourself in this house. I love who you are and I want you to be proud of it." Sky's mother placed her paw on Sky's shoulder.

Sky looked at his parents with love, climbing over and hugging them both with a whimper.

I don't know why it felt so good to see it happening.

I looked over at Cal who was also smiling at the sight.

"I guess that means I can do this," Sky giggled, jumping onto me and snuggling up to my side. I laughed, putting my arm around him, his parents delighted to see that we were happy together. I could see Sky's dad wrap his arm around his wife, kissing her on the lips.

That's all I really wanted in a father. One that loved both my mother and me.

One that accepted me.

I looked down at Skyler, thinking about how much he's given me.

"Oh, wait!" I gasped, something suddenly coming to mind. "I have something for you!" I said, getting up immediately, racing back into Sky's bedroom.  

"What? You do?" Sky called to me from the living room as I searched through my luggage for the present.

I raced back out with his gift, wrapped in newspaper with a string tightening the packaging.

"I thought we said no presents." Sky whined, looking into my eyes with sorrow. He had felt betrayed. "I don't have anything for you! I'm gonna feel bad!" He whimpered as I handed him the wrapped box.

"It's not exactly a present..." I warned him, staring intensely at it. "Just open it and you'll understand."

Sky sighed and slowly took off the newspaper. He ripped it open to find his sketchpad. Not _his_ sketchpad, but the same brand. A new one.

"C-Charlie..." Sky stuttered, almost speechless at the item.

"I know how you used it to control your thoughts and feelings, and I noticed how stressed you were without it... so I got you a new one," I told him. It started to feel like me and Sky were the only two in the room.

"You shouldn't have... Charlie..." He moaned softly, tears coming to his eyes.

"It's okay, Sky, really," I whispered, deeply focused on his beautiful pink eyes. "You just owe me one now." I joked, giving him a soft punch in the shoulder. He laughed/cried his way into a hug with me.

"How did you pay for it?" He asked, holding tightly onto me.

"You don't need to know," I murmured, petting Sky's fur as he nuzzled deeper into my chest.

"Charlie," Sky's dad marveled. "You're so kind."

"We're so happy to have you in the family," Sky's mom added, even their eyes were tearing up. "We've never seen our son happier."

Sky passed a glimpse of a smile at them before resting his head in my chest again.

I didn't smile.

_Family?_

_Is this what it's like to be in a family?_

_For the first time in years, I feel like I'm part of a family again._

I felt good.

I felt... so... welcomed... by them.

They're so lovingly compatible together.

Could they be my family?

I'd definitely want that.

"No fair! Sky opened two presents at once!" Cal yelped.

We all laughed together. As a family.

It feels so good to say that.

After all the presents were unwrapped, we wolfed down breakfast and all played in the fluffy snow once again. This time around, no one got lost. Sky took out his bicycle and tried his best to ride it on the street in the snow, me mounting behind him, holding onto Sky on the seat as we rode. It was rocky and unbalanced due to all the snow, we even fell over a few times, but it was still plenty of fun. Olympia and Thompson brought sleds so we can slide down the hill that was near their house. I tucked Sky in between my legs as we soared down the slippery surface of the snow-covered hill. It felt like we were flying. Calico took a few turns with Sky and me before he started having another snowball fight with his parents. I wrapped my arms around Skyler from behind, placing my chin on his head, my muzzle protruding through his ears. We watched on as Calico flitted about with Olympia and Thompson. Sky turned around and gave me a sweet, sensual kiss.

Turns out that Olympia and Thompson did get me a present, it was a last-resort kind of deal since they found out about me so soon. It was an old VHS tape of Skyler as a baby. Of course, Sky protested watching it. Calico actually had to hold him back as me, Olympia, and Thompson set it up on the big TV. Sky watched with embarrassment as we looked over old memoirs of the past. He kept hiding his face, causing me to hug him intensely.  

We played Christmas games inside and shared more memories of past holidays. It was funny to hear about the time Cal locked Sky in the bathroom for almost a day. I had never seen Skyler blush so much, and yes, I'm counting every time I called him adorable.

The sky got darker and we ate a turkey dinner over candlelight. We laughed, we joked, we talked for hours.

I looked around. The Christmas tree was shining bright and emitting a warm sensation. The orange, green, and red color blend of the house decorations made me feel protected. At the dining table, Skyler, Calico, Olympia, and Thompson sat around me, always wanting to engage with me. They made sure I didn't feel alone. They made sure this was a special Christmas. They made sure I was okay.

Somehow, they made sure of everything without even knowing it. It's just who they are. Good people.

I looked at Skyler. He's a beautiful blue and pink cat with a shy exterior, but an enormously jubilant personality once you get to know him. He's kind, he's charming, he's creative, talented, unique, funny, perfect.

I love him. I love his family.

_I love my family._

That night, everyone except for Sky and I were already asleep. Me and Sky slow danced in the privacy of his living room, next to the only light source shining in the house: the Christmas tree. My arms were wrapped around his waist, his arms around my shoulders, our foreheads touching together. Our bodies intertwined. We moved slowly and carefully, not allowing this moment to pass.

We slow danced for hours.

I closed my eyes one last time.

Now that I have looked at everything, I think to myself...

_Is this where I'm supposed to be?_

_Do I fit in?_

The answer?

It doesn't matter.

For the first time in the twenty years of my life, I didn't care about who I was. I cared about who I was with.

I belong with Skyler.

I belong in this family.

I belong _here_.

Is this my happy ending?

My happily ever after?

You never can tell, Skyler.  
  
  

_You never can tell._

# 42. SKYLER'S BIRTHDAY

### Valentine's Day Special Chapter!

\~~~

## Charlie

### FEBRUARY

The missing space where my pink and blue feline would usually sleep began to bring me to wakefulness. I moved my hand around the bed, searching for him, but to no avail. I sat up in bed, my head a little dizzy, to find a glimmer of light on the walls of the apartment.

Following it with my eyes, I saw Skyler hunched over his desk, his headphones over his ears, whisking away to another one of his watercolor paintings, illuminated by a dim lamp. I looked at my phone, a little confused, noticing that it was three in the morning.

I slowly sat up from the bed and waddled over to where he was. Sky turned his attention up to me, surprised, like he didn't expect me to wake up. He took off his headphones and gave me a warm grin that seemed to say, "you caught me", sitting back into the chair. He looks so cute, wearing my t-shirt. Recently, he's been obsessed with stealing my clothes, claiming that they're much warmer than his. Sky's always cold, no matter what.

"Why are you up, Sky?" I whispered gently as not to wake the others in the apartment.

"Couldn't sleep." He admitted, looking down at his painting, causing me to look at it too.

It was a painting of an ethnic neighborhood, the sun barely breaching the sky, the clouds shimmering in the peach sunset. The trees were painted so elegantly that it seemed as though they were moving on their own, swaying in an artificial breeze. Red paper lamps hung on streamers, zigzagging down the humble alleyway. Marks from black and white pigment pens were used to show shadows and dimensions. The grainy texture of the Strathmore paper showed in the colors, giving the image solidarity and consistency. It looked like a real photograph, taken on film.

"You made a whole painting because... you couldn't sleep?" I tried to process the thought.

Sky shrugged and looked at me with a hint of melancholy in his eyes, a faded smile just below them.

"Are you feeling emotional?" I asked him, walking around the desk and to his side, brushing my paw gently through the fur on his head.

"I try so hard not to, but, every year, I always get like this."

"You're always sad the night before your birthday?"

"I'm emotional, not sad. Two very different things." Sky chuckled, placing his tender paw on mine, moving it from his head to his shoulder. "But, yes. Always."

"How come?" I say, massaging my thumb into his shoulder.

"Everything changes, Charlie." Sky sniffed, tears coming to his eyes. "It's good, but it's bad, but it's good again, but then it turns back to bad. It's so overwhelming, but it's so pleasing. It's like... happiness makes me sad. Smiling makes me want to cry."

I kneeled down to his height, kissing his paw ever so slightly. "You've come so far, Sky."

"I know," Sky bursts with both laughter and tears, squeezing my hand in return. "But, how much will change by next year? And the next?"

"It doesn't matter at this moment. Sky, you're about to turn nineteen."

"I feel so old and so young at the same time." Sky sucks in air and releases it shakily, turning his head so I don't see his face, wet with tears. "God, I hate my emotions," He laughs audibly, wiping his tears and turning his body to face mine.

"Come back to bed, Sky." I plead, rubbing my paws against his leg. "You'll feel much better tomorrow morning."

"It's my first time celebrating without my family. You didn't plan anything right? Like I asked you not to?" Sky smirked, brushing his paw against my muzzle.

"It's your birthday and Valentine's Day tomorrow, Sky, of course, I planned something."

"But nothing big, right? All I want is to spend time with you and the others. You know that's all I want."

"I know, Skyler. I know." I told him, wrapping my arms around him as I stood up, carrying him, bridal style, to the bed where we spent our nights. The bed where we first kissed, where we reconciled, where we loved each other.

I placed him on his side of the bed, the side by the edge, and climbed over to my side of the bed, the side by the wall. Sometimes it switches, sometimes it stays the same, but it'll always be our bed. I wrapped my arms and legs around him, spooning him from behind. I heard Sky purr softly. I love it when he does that, I rarely get to hear it. It's calm and relaxing and... _ugh, I love him so much._

"Happy birthday, my lovely little valentine," I whisper into his ear as I cradled him to sleep.

\~~~

## Skyler

I woke up in the morning to a thousand little kisses from Charlie himself, touching his lips to every surface area of my face.

"Ah! Charlie!" I giggled, ticklish, trying my best to push him away, though he was persistent.

"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Skyler, happy birthday to you!" Charlie sang in a low, calming voice as he pulled out a paper plate with a small cupcake on top. He pulled out a lighter as he finished his song, igniting the candle in one quick motion.

I sat up in bed, pushing my whiskers out of my face, looking down at the cupcake. Like the candle wax, my heart felt like it was melting. I looked at Charlie with that same heartwarming feeling in my eyes.

"Make a wish, kitten," He whispered.

I close my eyes for a moment and extinguish the flame with a feeble blow. The smoke rises to the air within the small space between us. I blush, stretching Charlie's oversized, graphic T-shirt, that I now wore as my pajamas, over my legs as Charlie stares at me lustrously.

"What'd you wish for?"

I take a moment before answering.

"Nothing," I told him. Of course, he gives me a confused look. "I have everything I need, right here, right now."

Charlie then flashes his signature smile, motioning the plate to me.

"I haven't brushed my teeth yet," I informed him.

"Just eat the damn thing," Charlie commanded. I took the cupcake and tore out the candle, placing it on the paper plate. I removed the small wrapper and took a bite. It was soft and moist, like biting into a cloud, and it tasted light and sweet, like candy.

"Did Claire make this?" I asked him after I swallowed, careful with my manners.

"Of course, she did." Charlie smiled, placing his paws on my T-shirt-covered knees.

"Mhm, tastes like it," I say before going in for another bite, Charlie watching as I chew. It sure does feel a little awkward for me to be watched while I eat, but Charlie seems to be into it. In fact, he leans in for another kiss.

"Wait, there's literally food in my mouth‚Äî!" I protest before his lips land against mine. Thankfully, he didn't use his tongue.

"Mm, makes it taste sweeter," He flirts, touching our noses together. "Alright, now that you've had your breakfast, get up, take a shower, brush your fucking teeth, get dressed, and meet me outside on the front porch in about an hour or less." Charlie rushes eloquently, slapping down an outfit for me to wear on the bed.

"W-What?" I stuttered, caught off guard.

"Do it."

"Wait, what time is it?" I yawn, rubbing my eyes, noticing it's not even that bright out.

"6 in the morning."

"What?"

"Hey, it's your fault that you stayed up 'til 3, not mine. Get up, take a shower, get ready. Meet me outside." Charlie said, hopping up from the bed and leaving the room in a hurry. He was strangely already dressed and prepared for the day.

_He has something planned._

_Oh, god, here we go._

\~~~  

After doing all the things Charlie had asked of me, I walked down the hallway to the stairwell in the outfit he gave me, ripped skinny jeans and a blue, short-sleeve, crystal-wash T-shirt. They were mine, obviously, they were in my drawer. I don't know why Charlie picked them, though. And I don't know why it was short-sleeve, it was freezing.

Charlie stood by the door waiting for me, wearing a gray, short-sleeve polo, black shorts, and the same bowtie he wore prom night. In his hands, he held a backpack and a winter coat, two of each for the both of us.

"You're relentless, you know that?" I smirked as I walked down the staircase. I began to shiver in the cold atmosphere of the living room. "Why did you pick out my outfit, why didn't you just let me dress myself?"

"Uhh, I may have... took the rest of your clothes," Charlie mumbled.

"What? Why?" I asked, walking across the living room floor to his side.

"You'll see when you get outside."

"It's so dark out, what's going on?"

"Sky? Step outside." Charlie assured, handing me the coat.

I put it on and, as requested, stepped outside.

The cold, morning, February air hits me as the door opens. I pull the coat hood over my pointy ears as my breath rises in a puff of smoke. I look out from our porch, spotting a suspicious-looking long vehicle out front in the middle of the street. From inside, I can hear muffled party music and see flashing colors just peeking through the blacked-out windows.

It's a limo.

"Charlie, oh my god," I sighed, collapsing my head into my hands.

"C'mon, let's go." Charlie giggles as he closes the door behind us.

"I told you I didn't want anything crazy!" I whined as Charlie guided me down the staircase, leading me to the limo.

"You should've known that that's literally an incapability of my fucking existence, Sky." Charlie teases as we walk up to the car.

Charlie grabs ahold of the door handle and slides it open, revealing Jonathan, Becca, and Claire inside. They all immediately turned their heads to us, who had disrupted their psychotic dancing.

"Sky!" They all shout in unison as they reach for me, tugging me inside the limo. Charlie pats my back as I am taken.

First, I get scooped up by Claire, who is the MVP of power hugs. Then Becca pulls me into her embrace, ending in the two girls fighting over me. Jonathan and Charlie stood back and watched as the hugging went down, snickering.

"What is going on?!" I attempt to shout through my laughter.

"WE'RE GOING TO LA, BITCH!" Claire screams, placing her hands on my shoulders as she and Becca screech at the top of their lungs. "WE'RE PULLING A FUCKING DAVID DOBRIK‚Äî"

"What?!" I gasp, directing my head to Charlie. He blushed, nodding his head softly. "Is this why it's so early in the morning? How did you even find the time to plan this?"

"We all pitched in," Jonathan said with a shrug.

"You guys!" I whined, sitting onto the black leather couch that stretched across the whole interior of the car. I barely got to observe my surroundings with all the hugging. Color-changing fluorescents glowed on the ceiling of the limo and under the seats. Multiple TV screens were built into the walls of the vehicle, the largest one adorning a shelf below it, stacked with small glasses and a variety of drinks in ice-filled containers. A small window towards the front of the car, when looking through, lead to the driver's area, where, said driver, had turned down the raging music, allowing us to indulge in conversation. "We're actually going to California?"

"Well, the Santa Monica Pier, to be exact," Becca adds.

"For how many days?" I asked, eager to unleash my boatload of questions.

"Just the weekend, we'll be back home by tomorrow!" Claire informed me.

"But, I didn't even pack a bag‚Äî" I tried to say before Charlie tossed the backpack he was holding earlier into my lap.

"Everything you need is in there, snowflake," Charlie assured, kissing my nose. "I swear, I didn't miss a thing."

I looked at Charlie, wanting so bad to be angry with him, angry over the fact that he completely ignored my wish to have a quiet birthday, but I just couldn't. He doesn't deserve that. I don't deserve him.

I should be thankful.

"You four did this all for me?" I whispered, my voice breaking in disbelief.

I can't believe that they would go this far just to celebrate my own birthday.

"Sky, you deserve _something_ good after everything you've gone through recently," Claire beamed, placing her paw on my shoulder.  

"You've been there for all of us," Becca praised, sitting next to me on the seat. "It's time we make it up to you."

I looked at them. All of them. Becca, Claire, Jonathan, Charlie. They all care about me. They all love me for who I am. Never would I have imagined that I'd have such loving friends. Such a loving boyfriend. I wanted to cry even more but I told myself I wouldn't. It's time that I have a genuinely good time for once.

"Thank you." I gush, hugging the backpack tightly since I didn't know what else to hold and I needed to squeeze my bubbly feelings into some sort of object. Usually, it was Charlie. "I owe all of you."

"Nooooo‚Äî" They all groaned together.

"Shh! I owe all of you! Now, let's go!" I cheered, throwing my fist into the air.

"Yay!" They all whooped in return.

Becca closed the door to block out the freezing air as Claire and Jonathan told the driver to head for the airport.

Charlie sat next to me and wrapped his arm around my body as the limo took off down the streets of Cloverland.

\~~~

It was a four-hour flight since we're not that far from Cali and the weather was perfectly normal. It took an hour to get to the airport and the wait only took half an hour since it was early in the morning and the airport was still relatively empty. We almost had the whole plane to ourselves. It felt stealthy and sneaky, like the airport wasn't even open and we were just creeping around the place like spies. When we arrived in Cali, it was twelve in the afternoon.

Once we stepped out of the airport, the bright sun hit our faces, as well as the warm temperature. It always feels like summer in California, no matter what time of the year. I now understand why Charlie made me wear what I'm wearing, the temperature has definitely risen to a certain degree. We had put our winter coats in our backpacks and our sunglasses over our eyes. The five of us climbed aboard a shuttle as it made its way out of the airport parking lot and into the crowded streets of LA. We all stared in amazement as we drove past different landmarks: three giant metal statues that spelled 'LAX', the Hollywood sign far away in the mountains, the Griffith Observatory sat upon a hill. The driver practically gave us a whole tour.

The sun shone through the palm trees, revealing a clear blue sky, disturbed by zero clouds. The streets were loud and noisy, everyone here seemed famous or at least a part of California culture. Just beyond the horizon, we could see an endless beachside clustered with waves, sand, and a sea of animals, all enjoying the summer-like atmosphere. The shuttle dropped us off right by the long boardwalk, the Santa Monica Pier; a jungle of bright colors and screaming fun just ahead.

Me, Charlie, Jonathan, Claire, and Becca took the sight in before setting off. In the distance, we could see a momentous amusement park housing rides, various shops, and the famous Ferris wheel you see in every iconic photo of the Santa Monica pier. We all held our hands together and ran down the wooden foundation, supporting us high above the water below. It didn't feel like it was just _my_ birthday. It felt like it was all of ours. The Breakfast Club.

After acquiring a lifetime supply of tickets from the booth, we raced down the busy boardwalk and found ourselves in front of a gateway, an arc decorated to look like an octopus, with big letters that read "Pacific Park".

"What do you want to do first, Skyler?" Charlie asked me as we walked through the swarm of animals.

"Whatever you guys want to do," I suggested.

"Quit being so kindhearted!" Claire teased, skipping around to my side. "It's your birthday, so, what do you want to do?"

I examined the spectacle of the amusement park: the Ferris wheel, the rollercoaster, that weird tilt-a-whirl-like attraction with shark heads, the ride with the boat that goes back and forth, the tall pole that you go up and down sporadically strapped into a seat with over-the-shoulder restraints, I could go on... All things that could likely end up with my guts being spilled out.

"Uhh... maybe the rollercoaster?" I suggested, not knowing what to say. I used to never go to amusement parks. Not that I wasn't allowed to, I just didn't like how crowded they were, so I chose not to go.

Safe to say that I've changed.

"Damn, we just got here and you wanna go full throttle?" Jonathan smirked.

"What do you want me to say?" I whined.

"'West Coaster' it is!" Becca cheered in excitement.

We all followed the yellow and orange tracks that were suspended high in the air to find the entrance to the ride. We ran through the crowd, laughing as our shoes clacked against the concrete as they did on the boardwalk. The five of us got into line, and before we knew it, we were at the gate. Since we were in the front of the next batch to ride the rollercoaster, Charlie and I got to choose where to sit.

The train was about twelve cars in length, each car having two seats. I walked towards the caboose before Charlie grabbed my hand and guided me towards the front of the train.

"Charlie, we are not going in the front," I tell him, but he's, as always, persistent. I love the way he makes me feel.

"Ladies first," Charlie joked, gesturing me to get in the front car.

"Charlie, no," I repeat.

"C'mon, birthday boy, the fun doesn't last. You better take your share before it's all gone." Charlie raises his eyebrows and, of course, I can't help but blush. Defeated, I enter the car, taking the seat to the right. Charlie follows, taking the seat to my left.

Jonathan and Claire sat in the seats behind us, and Becca sat alone behind them. I honestly felt bad for her, but that was until another girl her age, a labrador with dyed fur and multi-colored clothing, took the seat next to her. They shook hands and began to have a small, energetic conversation. Of course, I winked at Becca.

_What? It's Valentine's Day._

"You ready, cupcake?" Charlie brings me back to reality as he folds in the protective restraint that keeps us from falling out.

"Every day, it's a new pet name." I scoff, getting situated in the seat. I tried to fix my tail, I was sitting on it weird.

"What, you don't like it?"

"I always hated it when couples used pet names."

"Well, you better get used to it, because I think by now we are officially deemed a couple."

"Really? I can't believe it!" I mock sarcastically.

One of the employees tells us what to do and what not to do over the speakers as another runs swiftly down the aisle, checking if everyone is locked in tight. Charlie sneakingly holds my hand, noticing that it's fidgeting.

"What's wrong?" He whispers to me.

"It's been years since I've ridden a rollercoaster," I whisper back.

"Oh, shit, really?" Charlie says as I nod in response. "Don't worry, Sky, I'll be right here, right next to you the entire time."

"You can't really go anywhere else."

"That is true."

"Thank you, puppy."

"Oh, so, now I have a pet name?"

Before I could respond, at that moment, the car lurched into motion, causing me and Charlie's bodies to jerk forward. We chuckled as we pulled ourselves together.

We were now going uphill.

The sound of the tracks clanking against the wheels of the car was beginning to get me anxious, and a little nauseous, but Charlie's grip on my hand was seizing the fear, much to my pleasure. We were growing higher and higher, getting the top-down view of the amusement park that we very much needed before when trying to find the ride. The American Flag on the side of the track ahead, blowing in the wind, signified where the drop was, and only then did I remember that we were in front.

I looked at Charlie, who was excited, then back to the track.

_Just have fun, Skyler. Just have fun._

_Have fun with the people you love._

We passed the flag and the track suddenly curved downward.

I closed my eyes.

_Here we go._  
  
  
  
  
  

There wasn't a drop.

_Huh._

It was just a tiny pothole. I turned my head to Charlie, who also seemed disappointed. Returning my eyes back to the front, I noticed that the track led to a spiraling intersection.

_Oh, that's what I'm supposed to be scared of._

_Got it._

"Charlie, I get nauseous really easily!" I yelled over the blaring wind as we closed in on the spiral.

"Shit," Charlie responded in the same fashion, he didn't have much time to think about it. "Just don't think about circles and you'll be okay!" He stuck a thumbs-up at me along with a mouth-gaping-smile.

_Every day I wonder to myself why I love Charlie._

That was when the car curved to the left and we raced down the track, going in repeated circles, down, down, down, before flying through a set of wavey bumps, going down _and_ up. My body felt like it was sinking into itself. I held on for dear life. As we sped through the rollercoaster, I grasped the bar in front of me tightly, squinting my eyes. Charlie, on the other hand, held his hands in the air, screaming, enjoying the ride. It felt like I was going in (metaphorical) neverending loops. We went up, down, left, right. The wind screamed against my face, pushing my fur back. I heard everyone on the ride behind me, shouting in exhilaration. I was just trying to hold on and survive. That was my only goal. This reminded me why I don't ride rollercoasters.

Before I knew it, we were right back at the start. The train hissed as the protective restraint retracted, releasing its tight grip on my abdomen.

"Aw, that was kinda boring..." Charlie muttered.

"'Boring'?!" I gasped, looking at him with a glare that spoke, 'I'm gonna kill you'.

"It wasn't even that fast!" Charlie reasoned, nudging my shoulder with his.

"Do you see my fur right now?!"

Charlie took a moment to take in the view of my hair, pushed back by the wind, stuck in place like a bad case of bedhead.

He began to burst with laughter. So did I.

Charlie licked his paw and patted down the fur on my head.

"Better?" He asked, ruffling my hair with his paws before caressing the sides of my chin.

"I can't see it, but I hope so." I giggled. Charlie then kissed my forehead before we were forced to get off by the employees so the next batch of animals could ride.

As we left the attraction, the four of us watched from a distance as Becca exchanged numbers with the girl she met on the train. They separated, causing Becca to skip back over to us. She was seemingly smitten.

"Who was that girl you were with, Bec?" Claire asked as we all continued to leave the rollercoaster.

"I dunno," Becca muttered, blushing, looking at her phone.

"Someone's gonna get their Valentine tonight!" Jonathan hyped, patting Becca repeatedly on the shoulders.

"Shut up!" Becca swooned.

We all cackled as a group before finding the next thing to ride.

We spent the rest of the day touring the amusement park, riding other attractions, laughing, talking. We then checked out the boardwalk after eating a small lunch, viewing the gift shop and more. Charlie opened his backpack and pulled out his polaroid camera, using the film Jonathan had gifted him for Christmas. He took multiple photos of me and the others, attracting a collection of smiles, funny faces, bunny ears, and selfies. I took a pair of unpaid sunglasses from the stand and put them on Charlie, taking the camera and snapping a funny photo of him. Watching him pose, I realized that I had forgotten about how attractive he was. He can definitely pull off short-sleeve polos, it was his signature look. Charlie took off the sunglasses and pushed the camera out of my face, landing another kiss on my mouth. He picked me up and spun me around, making me scream with excitement. I never thought I'd be a part of _that_ couple, the one you'd look at and be annoyed by how... romantic they are with each other... but, here I am, in public, choking on my own giggles as Charlie lifts me in the air.

Sometimes I forget that there are people watching when I'm with him. He's that hypnotizing.

The sky was now significantly darker, adorning a pink and navy blue fade, the glimmering sunset just breaking through the horizon. It reminded me of the painting I had made last night. Charlie took me by the hand, leading me to yet another place. But, this time, we were alone.

We were making our way to the giant, brightly-lit Ferris wheel.

We got in line and waited as the massive structure loomed over us, and once we got to the front, we entered our assigned gondola. Charlie, again, allowed me to get in first, like the gentlemen he is, closing the car door behind him.

We went up.

As we rose in height, I looked over the landscape, seeing the many moving contraptions, adorned with flashing lightbulbs, and wandering citizens below. Different people from different worlds. I saw the beach beyond the boardwalk, admiring the ocean and its waves, the sunset reflecting across the waterline, shimmering and sparkling. It was beautiful up here. Beautiful, and magical, and ethereal, and graceful. The wind was calmer and the breeze flowed through my fur elegantly.

"It's so pretty," I spoke with a breathy voice, closing my eyes, taking in the sound of seagulls and crashing tides. "I've always wanted to live by the beach. My dream house would have a balcony, standing tall above the sand, looking out amongst the ocean. I would imagine sitting in a beach chair, sipping tea, dressed in a robe, allowing the salty wind to flow through my body."

My eyes turned to Charlie, who sat directly across from me.

We spent a good few minutes looking at each other, admiring each other, as we increased in height, reaching the top.

He's so handsome. His fur is fluffy and crystal clear, the brightest shade of white I'd ever lay my eyes on... his eyes are awe-inspiring, gorgeously brown, like two suns, shining their rays of warmth over me... and his smile... that damn smile... the way his mouth curves at the end of his muzzle... his smirk... every time he flashes it at me, I get butterflies.

I can't believe he's mine.

I can't believe I'm his.

Suddenly, we stopped. I looked below to see that someone else was climbing aboard at the bottom. We were at the very top of the wheel. The highest point. It was like a romance movie. It was perfect.

Charlie swiftly moved from his side to mine, careful not to rock the gondola.

He sat next to me, exhaling deeply as he took in the sight of me.

"I feel bad that I didn't get you a present." He slurred.

"Are you kidding? Look around, Charlie. This is what I call a present."

"A present from all of us. I didn't get you one individually."

"Charlie... you being here with me... that's all I could ever ask for."

We went back to that phase of just staring into each other's eyes, enjoying every second we have up in the air before we came back down.

"I could say a thousand things to you right now, but I know you can already tell what I want to say."

"I won't say it out loud," I whispered, smiling uncontrollably.

"That's perfect, Sky," Charlie breathed, his voice not even audible anymore as he got closer.

Every inch that separated us diminished second by second. Moment by moment. Our lips felt only an atom apart, the electricity tying our bodies together. Charlie urgently pressed his muzzle against mine, kissing me passionately, tenderly placing his paw around my waist and tugging me in.

He makes me feel so many new emotions. New emotions that I didn't even know existed.

I love Charlie so much.

I love him so much.

I don't think I've ever been happier.

\~~~

After waiting for about an hour or two, we checked into a busy hotel at about 9:40 at night. Claire and Jonathan got their own suite, a king-sized-bed to themselves. Becca paid for her own private suite, a lounge all to herself. She could call that girl if she wanted. Me and Charlie got a normal hotel room. Charlie wanted to get a suite, but I convinced him that it didn't matter. He had already done so much.

We entered our own private room, illuminated by red neon fluorescents. The atmosphere seemed so Vegas-like, and it smelled like rich perfume. It felt like I was living in a Quentin Tarantino film. Once we had gotten situated, Charlie immediately began to make out with me, pushing me up against the wall. Of course, I allowed it.

We threw our bags and belongings on the floor before climbing into the queen-sized-bed in the middle of the room.

I sat on the mattress first, Charlie crawling in after me, climbing over my body before resuming his intense kissing. He grabbed my wrists and pushed them down into the cushions under the red glow of the neon lights above. He didn't give me any space to breathe, and I enjoyed the lack of air. So did Charlie.

I knew where Charlie wanted to go with this, and of course, I was reluctant.

But, he seemed so excited... I didn't want to hurt his feelings...  
  
  

"Charlie..." I exhaled as Charlie kissed my neck. He looked up at me, his attention caught. "I'm sorry..." I frowned, turning my vision to a place that wasn't his facial expression.

"For what?" Charlie asked with a scoff, shifting into a more comfortable position over my body.

"I... I can't have sex with you."

"What?" Charlie asked, seemingly caught off guard. "Sky, I'm not pushing to have sex with you."

"You weren't?"

"Of course not, I know what you are and aren't comfortable with. Remember? I don't miss a thing."

"But... it seemed like you really wanted it... the perfect timing... the perfect setting... it being Valentine's Day and all..."

"Sky..."

"I don't want you to lose interest in me..."

"Sky, don't say that." Charlie sighed, lying down on his back next to me in the bed. "I love you, and I could never lose interest in you. A healthy relationship can function without sex, you know that, right?"

"I know... I'm, just... I always feel like I'm holding you back from what you want."

"Oh, Sky..."

"It's... just... I don't know if I'll be... if I'll ever be... able to lose my virginity." I confessed. I've never gotten the chance to express this. "Not just to you, to anyone. I don't even know how to... get... turned on correctly. I never got the chance to experience... puberty... a-and growing up as a teenager. It was all ruined by... you know what. Plus, my disease..."

"Skyler. I get it." Charlie comforted, touching his head to mine. "I'm serious, I really do." I flipped onto my side in the bed, Charlie doing the same, that way, we were facing each other. "When I lost my virginity... to my first girlfriend... it wasn't right. She was manipulative and psychopathic... and I wasn't ready. She forced me to have sex with her. She coerced me. And I felt so guilty afterward... I felt so dirty and evil and gross and, ugh, you know what I mean. I never wanted to have sex ever again..."

I didn't know what to say or what to think... other than it felt good to let Charlie reveal this side of himself. To let him open up to me about his sexual history. I was, honestly, curious.

"But, the same went for my second girlfriend. It was disgusting and toxic... and it hurt me. It hurt me to know that I let myself go through that same disgusting practice that I swore I would never do again. That I had such little appreciation for myself. I never want you to feel the way I did. But, unfortunately, you have, and I can't do anything to change that. So, I'm going to try my best to make sure you never feel that way _again_." Charlie admitted, staring into my eyes, a look that made me feel safe and secure. "When I met Cassie, it took us a few months to understand what we were doing and how we were doing it. It took an additional few months to even understand our relationship. She just wasn't emotionally prepared to lose her virginity, and it reminded me of how I felt when I was forced into sex. So, it took time. But, when she was ready and we did do it... it felt amazing. For the first time, it felt good. It didn't feel like I was trying to be someone else, it felt like I was there, with a person that I cared for, showing our love for each other. Physically."

I made a face. Charlie chuckled.

"I know, it sounds so cheesy. We actually did it on Valentine's Day, in fact."

"Wow, I didn't know today was the anniversary of your and Cassie's night of passionate love." I snickered.

"Quit it," Charlie smirked. "Since her family was never one for Valentine's Day, she was always free. I remember that. Cassie was always free on Valentine's Day, no matter what."

"I still have yet to meet her," I added. "But, I can already tell that I like her."

"Skyler..." Charlie looked at me with love twinkling in his eyes. "I want you to have that feeling, too. I want you to have the chance to know how good it feels, how happy it can make you, without the fear, doubt, or burdens of any outside force. You deserve to lose your virginity the right way. So... I am more than happy to wait. But, please, please, please, don't even feel bad about yourself... because I will always be in love with the cat that caught my eye the day I entered college campus. Take... as long... as you need."

Charlie pressed his lips to my forehead once again, sending a feeling of warmth throughout my entire body.

I don't know how I'll ever make it up to him, for everything that he's done for me...  
  
  

"Charlie?" I asked, dozing off.

"Yeah?" He responded, his voice as tired as mine.

"When was the last time you talked to Cassie?"

"Uh... June, I think."

"You should call her."

"Wha..?"

"You should call her, right now."

"Sky, what do you mean?"

"You loved her. Not just as a partner, but as a friend. A best friend."

"Sky... It's your birthday..."

"You said that she was always free on Valentine's Day."

"She's probably asleep by now..."

"Call her, Charlie. Reconnect with her."

"I've tried, Sky. She won't pick up."

"Try again."

I got up and grabbed his phone that fell on the floor, handing it to him.

"Call her, Charlie," I told him. "Please. For me."

Charlie took the phone.

"Are you sure?"

"One-hundred percent."

Charlie sighed, getting up from the bed and entering the bathroom. I heard the door close behind me, satisfying my senses.

It feels good to help.

Help Charlie.

\~~~

**Charlie**

"Yeah, yeah, yeah... totally, Cass.

"I gotta go, it's almost time for his...

"Yeah, I know...

"Yeah, I'll tell you more about him tomorrow.

"Alri‚ÄîAlright, haha!

"Keep in touch."

I hung up the call. It was short, about eleven minutes or so.

She was still the same.

Cassie was still the same.  
  
  

I opened the door and entered back into the bedroom.

Sky lied in the bed, seemingly unconscious.

"No! No, no, no, no!" I whimpered softly, joining him back into the bed.

"Huh? What's wrong?" Sky gasped, awakened by my whining.

"Damn it, Sky. You're not supposed to fall asleep alone on your birthday!" I groaned, diving into the covers.

"Oh, sorry..." Sky laughed drearily, making me chuckle in delight.

"Come here, my valentine," I grunted, pulling him into my embrace, his body lying atop mine. Some couples find this position uncomfortable, but he was always so light, plus, the mattress supported the weight of us both.

Sky began to squeak in the slightest tone, moaning in the most adorable way.

I can't believe I made it a whole day without saying Sky's least favorite word.

"What time did you say you were born at, again?" I spoke in a soft voice, not wanting to disturb Sky's peaceful weariness.

"10:18," Sky mumbled, stuffing his face into my chest. He was fighting every urge to not conk out, but he was slowly losing the battle.

I looked at the analog clock on the bedside table. It was 10:16.

This small moment reminded me of the night before Christmas.

The night before I realized I had found my family. I had found my place in the world.

It was with Skyler Clawfield.  
  
  

10:17.  
  
  

"Happy birthday, Skyler."  
  
  

"Thank you, Charlie."  
  
  

"How do you feel, sweetheart?"  
  
  

"Exhausted."  
  
  

"You're allowed to be."  
  
  

"I know."  
  
  

"You're nearly nineteen, Sky. You made it."  
  
  

"I know."  
  
  

"I'm so proud. I'm so, so proud."  
  
  

"I know, Charlie. I know."  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

10:18.

# EPILOGUE

\~~~  

## Skyler

### JUNE

Me, Charlie, Claire, Jonathan, and Becca sat in our designated seats on the couches and chairs around the small coffee table in the back of Amber's. We had grown so attached to these seats over the course of the year, it was so good to finally come back to them.

We haven't been to Amber's in a while. We haven't had a Breakfast Club meeting in a while. Charlie and I don't even work here anymore.

Our first year of college had concluded in April. Once it was over, you could say we were hit with a wave‚Äîno‚Äîa tsunami of relief.

Like the others, I had returned home to my family for the summer break.

Charlie had to go back to an empty house.

In May, I was able to pay him and his childhood home a visit. It wasn't exactly as eventful as it would've seemed, but at least I kept him company. That house was scary. Cold. Hollow.

Charlie needed me and I needed Charlie, so I stayed at his place for a bit during May. We made the most of our time together. Some days, he would show me around the town he grew up in, allowing me to picture a young Charlie in my head. Some nights, we would make instant ramen with the loose change out of our pockets and watch a movie on his computer in bed. We slept in his empty room. We talked for hours at night, staying up until at least one in the morning. We had some arguments, some romantic moments. Nothing sexual had occurred, though. Not yet.

I don't know when I'll be ready, but I hope that when it does occur, it'll be the best thing to ever happen to me.

Things were going well for a while, just me and Charlie. That was until I got an email saying I won the state painting and essay competition that Mr. Bateman, my professor, had suggested I enter long, long ago in August of last year.

Of course, I was happy. Charlie was even happier, somehow. My family, when I told them, were somehow even happier than Charlie and I combined.

It made me think.

The whole reason I had asked for extra credit in the first place was because... I wanted to avoid Charlie. I wanted to avoid my feelings for him.

My main goal was to focus on my career and my art, not people. No distractions.

_Let's just say I got pretty distracted, alright..._

Mr. Bateman had said that the winner was announced by the end of May and awarded in June.

So, there was now a reason to return to CIVA once more before our second year of college.

It was good to see the apartment again and me and Charlie's room. Claire, when returning to her apartment, found an old shoebox in her closet.

Turns out, we had forgotten about our letters.

So, here we were, back at Amber's. Another Breakfast Club meeting taking place, finally.

Claire placed the shoebox on the coffee table. On the top, it read, 'Claire Chloe Harper, The Princess... Jonathan Oliver Greenwood, the Athlete... Charlie Klondike Cooperton, the Brain... Skyler Hazel Clawfield, the Basket Case', and scribbled in fresher pen at the bottom of the lid, 'and Rebecca Quinn Seabrooke, the Criminal'. Of course, it didn't match her personality at all, (I would know since Charlie and Claire made me watch the movie with them during the summer), but it was the only character left and we didn't want to leave Becca out. Claire had made Becca write her own letter once she was initiated into our club back in December, so she wouldn't be without one when we did read them.

"You folks ready?" Claire sighed expressively, stretching her arms before cracking open the dusty box.

"I'm honestly kind of scared," I admitted, rubbing my left arm with my right paw.

"You're shaking, Sky," Charlie whispered, wrapping his arm around me and pulling me in closer.

"I wrote that letter at one of the strangest periods in my life, Charlie. So much happened since then. It's going to hurt."

Claire flipped off the cardboard lid and inside, our letters were folded and creased; dusty, yet still intact. Claire picked up the papers and handed them out accordingly. I grabbed my letter. The folded-up note felt like sandpaper on my fur. On top, it read 'Sky', and already I noticed how much my handwriting had changed. Charlie looked at me with his folded-up letter, giving me a comforting smile.

"Alright," Becca nodded, looking at each of us individually. "Three, two, one..."

We all unfolded the letters together.

I looked at the note and began to read in my mind.



Hey, Sky!

It's younger Sky!

Uhhhh, so I don't really know what to write here because Claire is making us do this. She's calling us 'The Breakfast Club'. I've never watched the movie, but maybe someday I will.

I guess I'll start by asking, how are you? What's your life like at the moment?  Anything new and exciting? Any new accomplishments or advances in your career? Please tell me you've done at least something worth mentioning. I really hope CIVA paid off. It's probably going to be the best thing to happen to you or the worst. It's only been two months since I started and things are looking good...

I have to admit, everything is so weird at the moment, Ypu know exactly what I'm talking about (I hope). Charlie Cooperton. You just started dating him today. You're officially in a relationship. The first you've ever been in.

It's honestly fricking terrifying, but don't tell Charlie I said that. Right now, he's sitting next to me, writing his letter, deep in concentration. He's really excited to date me, but I don't really understand why. I don't understand why I'm so non-understanding. U guess it's because of how scared I am. I don't know where this relationship will go and how it will affect my life... I'm scared I'm going to screw everything up and destroy the relationship we have... I don't want to lose him because... he's one of the best things that has happened to me in a while.

So, I just want to ask, how are things with him? Are you guys still together? Crap, my handwriting is kind of messy because my hand is shaking just thinking about this. When you get this letter, It's possible that everything could be a total dumpster fire. Please tell me everything went alright... I really like Charlie... and I hope things go well with him.

Also, how are Claire and Jonathan? The two others sitting next to you in the coffee shop? Are they still together? Are they still your friends? God, I hope so. Them and Charlie are the first few real friends you've ever had, so I hope everything turned out fine with them. I hope I didn't screw anything up again.

How's Mon and Dad? Cal? Are they okay? Do they still like you? Haha, just kidding, they're the only ones I do know that are still in your life. That's how much I trust and love them. Tell them I said 'I love you'!

To be honest, I tihnk you deserve to hear it, too, older Sky. You've likely been through a lot, considering how emotional you are and that you're dating one of the sweetest guys on planet earth... You deserve to hear someone tell you that they love you.

So, I love you, Sky.

Keep doing what you're doing and don't give up.

Good luck with everything!!!

\- Younger Sky

  

My hands began to shake again.

I folded up the letter and put it in my pocket quietly.

I looked up, noticing that everyone was still reading their letters. They probably put more thought and effort into theirs.

I took a deep breath and let it out. I closed my eyes.

_Thank god._

  

I looked to my right to see Charlie, who seemed very wrapped up in his letter.

I saw a tear rolling down his cheek.

I scooted up next to him and rubbed his back, trying to show him as much love and appreciation as I could. He was silently crying. I didn't want to look at what his letter read, but whatever it was, it had affected him greatly.

He folded his letter back up once he was done reading, turning his head to me. His eyes were red but his smile was wide. He laughed quietly and pulled me into a hug.

"Are you okay?" I whispered into his ear.

"This is the best I've ever been," Charlie responded.

"Do you want me to read it?"

"Not now. Someday."

"Okay."

"Do you want me to read yours?"

"I would love that." I separated the hug and looked him in the eyes, placing my paws on his shoulders. "But, first, I know I've said this a thousand times, but right now, I've felt it more than ever. I love you, Charlie."

"I love you, too, Skyler."

We broke the connection apart slowly, noticing that the others were looking at us. We all exerted a breathy-exhale-of-a-laugh through our nostrils. I think we were all emotional after reading the letters. So much, in fact, that we didn't even have the power to laugh correctly.

I pulled the letter back out of my pocket and handed it to Charlie, who indulged himself in it.

"Sheesh, that's enough nostalgia for today," Jonathan spoke up, lightening the lowered mood in the cafe. We all laughed properly that time.

"It's almost time, guys," Becca added, looking at the clock on her phone. "Sky, are you ready?"

"Don't chicken out on us, babe," Claire patted my back.

"Yeah, I'm ready," I responded. "I'm nervous, but I'm ready."

"Don't be," Charlie spoke, leaning in close. "We're all so proud of you, Sky. Appreciation is nothing to be nervous about. You deserve this."

I nodded my head, placing my paw on his cheek.

We all got up from our seats and almost left the coffee shop, until something caught my eye. On the chalkboard above the register, there were these insanely good detailed sketches of anime figures and Japanese characters drawn in chalk next to the menu options. Like, amazingly good. Ten times better than any of the cutesy-crap I would draw.

"Hey, who did those?" I asked the cash register that we had paid for our drinks earlier. He was a raccoon.

"Oh, I did." The raccoon said, scratching the back of his neck. He seemed just as nervous and as shy as I was when I first worked at Amber's. When I first came to CIVA.

I suddenly remembered who he was.

"You're really talented." I encouraged the raccoon. "Keep doing what you're doing, and don't let anybody stand in your way, Milo."

He nodded his head with a smile.

Charlie took my hand as I realized the others had already gone without us. Charlie and I left Amber's with a bright attitude, entering the sun-kissed summer breeze just outside; the bell attached to the door jingling sweetly as it closed.

\~~~

I sat in-between my parents during the event in the campus auditorium. The assembly room was wide and long, seats scattered in neat rows and columns from the stage to the back of the room.¬†It was packed. Every seat was filled. Almost every animal came from at least one place each in the whole state.

The announcer on the stage, directly in the spotlight, in front of the podium, shared his speech about CIVA, their novelty program, how good life on campus is; the usual stuff. Then, he turned it over to the essay and painting contest runner, Dr. Diana Dushell, who is a very proud, powerful woman. She spoke a bit about the contest and how it contributes to the learning agenda, but then she started labeling the runner-ups. They sat up from the audience and walked on stage, their paintings and essays framed in a large plaque that stood up on an easel. They got their certificates and badges and moved to the side of the stage as the audience applauded.

I felt my mom grab my hand and squeeze it tightly, knowing that it was time.

"Now, we will announce the first prize winner of the state contest," Dr. Dushell spoke into the microphone. _I felt a chill run down my spine... a good one._

"Will Skyler Clawfield please come to the stage and claim their award?"

The audience began to applaud as I let go of my mother's hand and stood up, calm and collectively like I had practiced.¬†

I shifted my way through the row of animals and exited into one of the aisles, pushing my fur back behind my ears in a flit of awkwardness.¬†

Everyone kept clapping. I had never achieved so much admiration in my life. As I walked down the aisle, animals from either side of me clapped their hands together, smiling at me, mouthing words like 'Good job!', or, 'Congratulations!'. I couldn't keep my smile in. It was almost too much. I tried to thank each and every one of them as I made my way to the stage.

I walked up the stairs to get on top of the stage and walked over to the podium. The spotlight almost blinded me as I faced the audience, illuminating my surroundings and each and every dust mite floating through the air from the old stage. From there, I got the full view of the auditorium. Everyone was on their feet, applauding me. I scanned the whole room, landing my sights on Charlie, Claire, Jonathan, and Becca, who were in the front row. They were the loudest in the whole room: screaming, shouting, hyping me up. Charlie was especially happy. I could see it in his eyes. They were always saying something. To me.

I placed my paws to my face, overwhelmed by all the cheering.¬†

Mr. Bateman walked up to me and clipped a gold badge to my shirt. He winked at me and I smiled contently. It already felt like too much for something so small.

They brought in my painting, which was framed and attached to an easel like the others, but the plaque was golden instead of silver.

"Oh, my god, oh..." I mumbled into the microphone, taken over by joy. The tip of my nose accidentally knocked into the mic, causing loud feedback to ring through the auditorium like a screeching banshee. "Oh, sorry! Sorry!" Everyone in the audience laughed and kept telling me I was good and to keep going. The CIVA community is very supportive when you take notice.

"Um... Okay... So..." I stuttered, not knowing where to start. "I don't want this to be, like, an oscar award-winning speech, but‚Äî" The crowd laughed again. "‚ÄîI just want to thank everyone who was there for me when I was at... the lowest of lows of my life..."

I could see everyone nodding. They all knew what happened to me with that wolf... and it caused a lot of tension and backlash for CIVA. Me standing up for myself for this achievement should really prove the journey I've been through. The development I've made on myself.

I'm better now, better than ever.

"My professors, Mr. Bateman, you guys helped guide me through the hardship of my career... My friends, Cal, Claire, Jonathan, Becca, you guys made me feel so comfortable with myself... My parents, Olympia, Thompson, you've always supported me and inspired me to be who I am today, and I love you all so much. And Charlie... thank you for being the best thing to ever happen to me."

Each and every person that I mentioned looked at me with a sort of tenderness in their gaze. Somehow, they were all proud of me. If you look at it a certain way, they were all my mentors, my influencers, shaping me into who I am today. Who Skyler Clawfield is today.

Dr. Dushell came up to me and handed me the essay that I had written about my painting.

I looked back at my painting, taking it in before I read my essay.

It was of a massive, six-layer cake.¬†

Each and every tier showed aspects of vital moments and memories in my life. The happy, the sad, the loveliest, the worst... For each tier, I switched up the media, one was made with watercolor and pigment pens, one was made with acrylic paints, one was made with newspaper clippings and graphics, and at the top, a minimalistic version of me sitting, watching the sun rise slowly into the sky that took up the background of the picture.

I looked back at the audience and held up the essay, setting my sights on the first sentence.

My hands weren't shaking this time.

I took one last deep breath and cleared my throat.

  

"So... My mother had always told me that life was like baking a cake..."

## Charlie

"Hey, Sky, come over here," I said as we walked through town in the middle of the night, the cool summer aroma flowing through the atmosphere. Summer nights just have that smell, you know? The one that makes you feel free, unrestricted, unbound.¬†  

Sky followed me as I entered the park near Amber's, walking up to the massive rock that we had visited in August of last year.

I placed my paws on a crevice in the rock, grabbing hold and climbing up. Once I had found my footing on the top of the rock, Sky made his way up after me. I grabbed his hand and pulled him up, wrapping my arms around him.

I placed my paws on his waist, tugging him in closer. The tip of my muzzle touched his, our lips only an inch away.

It all felt so perfect. A perfect end to a perfect romance story.

Me and Sky, cradling each other on the top of a large rock, under the luminescent rays of the moonlight, the breeze swirling through our fur and fingertips. A quiet night, a quiet place to be alone.

"I'm so proud. You know that I am." I sighed under my breath.

"It's getting old at this point." Sky smirked. I could hear the way his mouth moved, the soft smacking of his lips, and the touching of his tongue against his teeth. His diction was poetic and smooth. Every little thing about him amazes me. He was such a beautiful creature.

"I've never met anyone like you, Sky." I began to sway back and forth with him, one foot to the other. "I've never been so in love with someone before."

"I'm so happy you came into my life." Sky continued.

"I'm so happy I have you."

"This is just the beginning, though, Charlie."

"Yeah..."

"It's not going to stay like this."

"Of course not..."

"Things are going to change. They may get worse, they may get better... But, all I know is that... I want to go through it with you. All of it. Every mishap, every landslide, every joyful emotion. I want to go through it all with you."

I smiled.

We knew each other so well that we almost never needed verbal agreement. A smile was sometimes all it took. A smile, a look, a touch, a kiss...

Sky leaned up on his toes and pressed his mouth to mine.

Though we've kissed many times, the feeling never gets old. It still elicited that same emotion we felt the first night we kissed. Love, lust, happiness... His lips still felt soft and silky. He still tasted like cotton candy. He was a sweet little thing.

And he was mine.

That's all I wanted.

  

We walked back to the apartment, hand in hand. Sky kept jumping up, shooting quick pecks at my neck, trying to tickle me. He didn't, but I still laughed like he did. I picked him up by his waist and twirled him around. He screamed like a girl and I laughed like a madman. I pretended to act like a zombie, chasing him down the street. I caught him once again and picked him up, pretending to devour him, noticing that we were just outside the empty apartment house.

As we walked up the stairs, Sky stopped me before we stepped onto the patio.

"Wait here," Skyler instructed.

"What, why?" I questioned as he ran up the steps and disappeared into the doorway. "Sky?" I called, but no response.

I waited for a few seconds until Sky emerged back out onto the front steps.

"C'mon, Charlie," He said, holding his hand out to me.

"What did you do?" I asked with a suspicious tone of voice.

"Come inside!" Sky begged, holding his paw out even more.

I took his hand and Sky opened the door.

It was extremely dark inside, all the lights were off and all the shades were drawn.¬†

Sky closed the door behind me and flicked on the light.

  

"SURPRISE!" I heard multiple voices cheer all around me before seeing who it came from. I jumped at the sound of it, grabbing Sky for defense.

The living room was crowded as hell. I first saw Jonathan, Claire, and Becca holding a one-tier chocolate birthday cake with candles and frosting decorating the top. I then saw Skyler's parents and Cal, then my photography professors and advisors, then Dylan, Byron, and Milo, then my classmates from my photography class that I had gotten along with so well. They all laughed at my reaction and began to applaud me, like they had done Skyler earlier.

"What is this?" I looked at Sky, who was laughing as well. I was so caught off guard that I didn't even know which emotion to display on my face.

"Happy birthday, Charlie."

"How did you know it was my birthday?"

"Jonathan told me. And he said that you don't like celebrating your birthday, because of your... mother... but, after what you did for mine, I only saw it fit that I throw you one just as nice."

"Sky, I... I don't know what to say..." I heard my voice begin to break up.

"There were only two people I couldn't reach. Cassie and..." I knew exactly who he was going to mention. Sky knew that I knew and moved on with his sentence. "But, I hope it doesn't bring your birthday down too much, because we're here, and we all love you, and we're all here to celebrate you, and give you a birthday party you deserve. So, don't say anything. Just enjoy it, Charlie. Just blow out the candles."

I looked around me again. Everyone who was there. They were all smiling and congratulating me.

They all cared about me.

Each and everyone one of them.

  

I wasn't alone anymore.

  

One year ago today, I sat, alone, in my dark bedroom, over one measly cupcake.

  

Now, I stand, in front of all my friends‚Äîno‚Äîmy family, ready to happily wish away my expiring age of twenty, and finally enter the next chapter. One that will be full of love, of hope, and of life.

Life is constantly growing. Thriving.

And it all matters on who I spend it with.

The people who make it worth spending.

The people who make it joyful, and exciting, and sweet. Just like birthday cake.

  

"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you!" I heard everyone around me sing. Sky just stood there, next to me, hugging my left side. I wrapped my arm around him tenderly, taking in every emotion and sensation that I was feeling in this exact moment. "Happy birthday, dear Charlie, happy birthday to you!"

As they sang, Claire, Jonathan, and Becca made their way up to me with the cake in their hands. Skyler squeezed my paw gently.

The candles burned brightly, lighting up my eyes and the tears that stained them. I could feel the warmth from the small distance that separated the flame from my mouth.

A tear fell from my eye.

Without looking, I blew the candles out with a single breath, submerging myself into the love and comfort provided by the warm family I have come to know so deeply; I have come to love so much.

# PROLOGUE

\~~~  

## Skyler

_Hm..._  
  
  

_I had heard the nicest song recently..._  
  
  

_I can't remember where I heard it, but it was nice. And I want to hear it again. But, I don't know the title and I can't detect any lyrics. Humming will have to do for now._  
  
  

_I have to keep my humming quiet, though, because he's sleeping. It's 4 AM._

_The moonlight is beaming down on us through the window like a UFO. I would expect it to be sweltering hot, considering that summer is upon us, but, no. It's a cool night._

_I snuggle deeper into his chest. His arm is around me, as always, providing me the comforting protection I need to feel safe and secure. I nuzzle in even deeper, hoping his embrace can squeeze away all the anxious thoughts running through my mind._

_I'm gonna miss this room. So many memories were made in this exact room. This apartment. This whole college._

_What will life be like outside of this room? Outside of this apartment? Outside of this college?_

_What will life be like... as an adult?_

_No guidance, no barriers, no support. On our own._  
  
  

_It's the nights I can't sleep where I'm always thinking way too much._

_I was diagnosed with insomnia a little while ago, and I suffer from sleep paralysis. It's always been a part of me, I've always suffered from a troubled sleep, but I first faced the official news of my condition a couple of years back._

_Of course, almost everyone deals with insomnia... But, in the beginning stages, mine was way different. Way worse._

_I would wake up in the middle of the night to see... him. The wolf._

_Although I had gotten over it, that image of him, beaten and bloodied, still haunts my dreams. I don't even remember his name anymore. I don't even feel scared of him, either. I've gotten better, much better, in fact, but... I think it was rather the idea, that I had left the wolf in that beaten-up state, that frightened me more than the actual incident._

_My worst habit is doubting myself. I always feel like I'm torturing people._

_And, though I know it's not true, I can't shake the thought._  
  
  

_When I was diagnosed, he was always by my side. Trying to fix my sleeping habits, driving me to behavior therapy, reminding me to take my prescription pills, and so on and so forth. I sleep better with him. So much better._

_But, on nights like this, not even he can soothe me to sleep with his gentle care and neverending love._  
  
  

_I tilt my head to the left of me, setting my sights on an unconscious Charlie._  

_He lies on his stomach, his head in the pillow. His right cheek collides with the cushion, allowing him to face me. You would think that he would snore or drool in that position, but he doesn't. He's too perfect for that._

_On nights like these, I question how I ever ended up with him._  
  
  

_We met..._  
  
  

_...four to five years ago._  
  
  

_It's been a while since then. A lot has changed._

_And, I mean, a lot._  
  
  

_Charlie is now 23 years old, currently a Hollywood cinematographer for movies, as well as an online photography influencer. He's grown and advanced a lot since the first year of college._

_He worked on a short film with Jonathan, and his classmate, Rue, in his second year of college, Jonathan being the director and producer, Rue being the writer, and Charlie being the man behind the camera (and co. director). Charlie used his perspective of photography and filmed the short with a unique, humble, visionary eye. He loves landscape shots; images that can capture wide spaces and a lot of details along with the characters moving on-screen._

_Charlie always loved to tell stories with his photos, and cinematography was a whole step up from what he's known, but he had a lot of fun with it. The short film was incredibly popular and it got Jonathan, Rue, and Charlie all sorts of popularity. (Charlie originally wanted me to audition for it, but of course, I declined politely.)_

_Charlie has been getting jobs all over the place for both photography and cinematography. It started out as small shooting gigs for weddings or major events; Then, he picked up jobs as an intern in the Hollywood business; And then, he climbed his way up to becoming a crew member for this pretty underground film that's incredibly good and underrated. It's one of those films that premiere at a lesser-known film festival, and Charlie forced me to go to it with him. I'm just kidding, I wanted to go, and I really enjoyed it, but not as much as the cinematographer himself. He connected with so many people and was having so much fun talking to other photographers about his favorite movies and methods of shooting. The film itself has its own cult following, and I'm always trying to promote it and get it more attention, but Charlie disagrees. He says that he likes mostly unknown films, that way, it doesn't get hyped up or ruined by fame. It just stays as it is: a small, indie movie that is enjoyed by certain audiences who understand and enjoy it for what it is._

_At least he likes to share his favorite films with me. Whenever he finds a movie he likes, he sits me down in the living room and forces me to watch them. I'll admit, he has pretty good taste. Charlie is never interested in huge blockbuster films or multi-million-dollar franchises. He always goes for the smaller, more petite, artistic, indie movies. He says, it's like... those movies are something special he has only to himself, and is not shared by other people. He likes to have his own opinions and his own movie picks that are unlike anyone else's. He likes to be unique._

_I guess that's one reason why I ended up with him._

_I'm a smaller, lesser-known, petite, artistic, indie movie._

_Compared to Charlie, I've almost got nothing worth-while mentioning. I'm 22 now, and I haven't done any crazy stunts in my career to boost my popularity or fame. As you've come to know by now, I'm not like that at all. The only accomplishment I'm proud of is that I have been building my knowledge of art and media substantially over the years. I learn a new thing, a new method, a new style of art almost every day. I have over a million pencil sketches in my portfolio, thousands of painted canvasses in the apartment, hundreds of digital artworks and designs on my sketchpad that Charlie had bought me on our first Christmas together, and an unlimited supply of art equipment. That means acrylic paints, pencils, pigment pens, markers, chalks, pastels, watercolors, canvases, easels, smocks, palettes, papers, notebooks, sketchbooks, etc. I always strive to learn something new and take my skills in a new direction. There's not one medium I dislike using. Except for crayons. Dear God, I hate crayons._

_Like Charlie, I keep my fascination with art mostly to myself and never promote it or share it or monetize it or want it to have a large following._

_But, Charlie is always encouraging me to put my art skills to good use. Like, find a job out of it. It sounds like a great idea at first, but I've searched and I've searched, and nothing seems to fit my description. Nothing seems to fit my needs for my art career. I'm very picky when it comes to what I want to do with my work. I have specific preferences._

_God, I really do sound like Charlie's other half._

_That doesn't mean I'm unemployed, though. I have a lot of side jobs, starting with shifts at Amber's, which is usually kind of on and off. I work part-time there, and I pick up shifts only when I truly need the money. Charlie doesn't work there anymore, but he does stop by to see how I'm doing occasionally. Once I graduate, I'll hang up the apron for good._

_Another part-time job that I've got going for me is, technically, being Charlie's assistant. With all the jobs he's picked up in LA, he definitely needs extra help. So, I manage his schedules, his habits, I bring him coffee and meals, and I'm also there for emotional support. It didn't exactly start out as a real part-time job, I was just being a helpful boyfriend, but then Charlie insisted that he pay me for all the hard work I put into keeping him in line, taking the money out of his weekly balance. I begged him not to, but he just wouldn't take no for an answer._

_He's not around as much as I would like him to be. He goes on week-long business trips to California almost every month, so we try to spend as much time with each other on the weeks he has off. I know what you're thinking, how could he possibly have a job migrating back and forth between states? Yeah, it sounds stressful, but the thing is, he got the LA job very recently. He only planned on doing that migrating thing for the last few months of college, and once we graduate, he's moving to Cali full-time. That's his plan._

_I support him, of course. I just don't know how I'll fit into his future. But, I never bring it up because it's mainly important to him, and not so much to me. I'm still figuring things out._

_If Charlie's happy, I'm happy._

_Plus, he lets me help out with his movie productions sometimes. Whether it's drawing storyboards or sketching his ideas onto paper for him to visualize what he wants in his cinematography... I was always there for him. It helped me learn new things as well, like, what it's like to (partially) be in the film business._

_Other than that, I'm just kind of a blank slate._

_I don't really have any room for a full-time job, you know? There are so many other things going on in my life that I have to pay attention to... Including my art and my career, and caring for my friends and family; Calico, Charlie, my Dad..._

_Claire, on the other hand, will also be moving to LA after college graduation with Jonathan._

_They got married recently. A few weeks ago, actually._

_Their wedding was absolutely beautiful. Charlie and I were both bachelors to Jonathan_‚Äî_Charlie was best man, obviously_‚Äî_but Claire forced me to go to the bachelorette party instead. It... sort of... suited me more... I helped arrange the theme and decorations along with Becca and a few other bachelorettes. Claire made the worst decision ever and baked her own frickin' wedding cake..._

_It was delicious, either way... but we should NOT have let her handle all that stress alone for her own damn wedding._  
  
  

_I could tell Claire and Jonathan were happy together._

_I had never seen either of them smile as wide and as joyfully as they did on their wedding night._

_Sometimes, I wonder if I'll get married._

_But, I don't like to think about it, because it makes me scared and worried and doubtful of myself and I'd rather not spiral down that dark, depressing hole at this moment..._

_Becca doesn't know where she's going to live after college. Her plan is to travel the world and write about her adventures in an online journal, obtaining inspiration for any house decor ideas._

_She has this end goal in sight: after exploring the world and getting as much inspiration as possible, she's going to build her dream house from the ground up. She plans to build it in her forties-to-sixties, so that, once it's all done and perfect, she'll retire and grow old in it, knowing that it's her perfect resting place. Her 'forever house'._

_Apart from that, she's a popular online influencer that's famous for being very humble and accepting, her YouTube channel and business website being a self-help sort of arrangement. She tries her best to give her own free therapy to those in need, reflecting on her past mistakes and triumphs, her content aiming at generating a safe, comfortable space for troubled souls. She talks to a lot of people online and helps them sort out their issues with her own input._

_Speaking of Claire, Jonathan, and Becca, they moved into the apartment a while ago. Dylan, Byron, and Milo all pieced out one by one, allowing more room for other possible roommates. So, we all decided to live together. It was pretty chaotic at first_‚Äî_Becca was pretty sad about leaving her apartment she had worked so hard on to design, but she eventually got a kick out of decorating our place anyway_‚Äî_but we all settled in and got accustomed to one another._

_But, nowadays, rarely anyone's home._

_Except for me._

_It sort of feels like everyone around me has grown up quicker than me._

_They're all, sort of, you know... there._

_They have everything planned out. Their careers, their jobs, their lives, their futures after college... I feel left behind, almost._

_But, of course, I can't blame them for that. I'm the one responsible for my own actions._

_For me, I'm constantly trying to learn._

_I don't have an end goal in sight. I'm just gliding through life at the moment, seeing where it takes me._

_The only thing I do know about what's happening after I graduate is that... I'll be going back home._

_My dad has recently gotten sick. He was diagnosed with leukemia a few months ago._

_As I said, it's been very stressful recently. For all of us._

_I want to be there for him, every step of the way, since he was always there for me. Both him, my mom, and Calico._

_So, I'm returning home after college is done._  
  
  

_Charlie knows, and like I was with his post-graduation plans, he's obviously very supportive._

_The only thing is that... he just wants me to do more with my career in the future, not just stay home for the rest of my life._

_We had a few arguments over it._

_I mean, we never had a perfect relationship, you know? Nothing's perfect. We can't always get along and not everything can always end up going the way we want. Something always gets in the way. Always._

_What, you really thought we had stayed a couple for four years straight?_

_We've broken up so many times that it's impossible to count._

_But, don't worry, we've gotten back together every single time._

_The longest time we had spent apart was about nine months. Apparently, Charlie had sex with some_ _girl_ _in that time period after getting wasted at a bar because he was so broken up over our separation._

_We had a few more arguments over that._

_Those long, excruciating months apart ended on Christmas Eve._

_I was definitely emotional during that holiday, because I had spent the past two Christmases straight with Charlie and my family. When he, supposedly, wasn't supposed to come because of our breakup, I was so heartbroken and upset. I didn't want to spend my favorite holiday sad and depressed... But, before the clock struck twelve, there was a knock at the door. I opened it, and Charlie was standing there, tears in his eyes. Per classic Charlie-Sky romance moments, he had given me a whole speech about how he loved me. How he loved me only. How I was the only one for him._

_I kissed him and pulled him inside. It had made Christmas ten times better._

_That was all in the past, though._

_It's time to focus on the now._  
  
  

_Graduation day is tomorrow._

_It's April._

_I'm about to become an actual adult._

_Guess what? I'm terrified._

_This is why I can't sleep._  
  
  

_I keep humming the song over and over, trying to allow the melody to soothe me to sleep, the touch of Charlie's arm over my chest providing even more comfort and bliss._

_I close my eyes, but it doesn't help._  
  
  

_Fuck, I'm so scared about graduating._

_Because... it means leaving the past behind._  
  
  

_This college is where I had my first... everything. My first interaction with others. My first friend. My first kiss. My first boyfriend._

_What had happened in that first year of college was like a dream. It was all I could've ever wanted. All I ever could've wished for. It was like Charlie and I got our perfect romance story, a perfect relationship, a perfect life. And it all happened here, at the Cloverland Institute of Visual Arts._

_Now that we're officially leaving, I'm scared that the painful truth of reality will ruin everything._

_God, I'm so fucking scared._  
  
  

_I keep humming the song._  
  
  

_I'm so scared... I don't want everything to be ruined... Even when they're so good right now._  
  
  

_Keep humming the song, Sky..._

_Go to sleep..._  
  
  
  
  
  

"Is that Moon River from Breakfast at Tiffany's?" I hear a groggy, listless voice exhale right beside my left ear.

I don't open my eyes. I don't need to.

His thumb gently caresses the side of my head.

He's woken up a thousand times to me crying.

He's woken up a thousand times to me wide awake.  

He's woken up a thousand times. For me.  
  
  
  

"Yeah, I... I think it is."

"I love that song."

"It's a beautiful song."

"What are the lyrics again?"

"I can't really remember."

"Oh, wait, I think it goes, 'Moon, river, wider than a mile... I'm crossing you in style... Someday...'"

Charlie's soft, hoarse voice whimpering out the lyrics of the tune I have longed to detect put my body at ease. My mind at ease.

I started to picture the lyrics as well. I could sing them, too.

So, I did.

"'Old dream maker... You heartbreaker... Wherever you're going..."

Charlie continued the symphony.  

"'I'm going your way..."

We then began to sing together. Simultaneously.

"Two drifters...

"Off to see the world...

"There's such a lot of world...

"To see...

"We're after the same...

"Rainbow's end...

"Waiting 'round the bend...

"My huckleberry friend...

"Moon...

"River...

"And me."  
  
  
  
  
  

It doesn't take long for me to realize that I've fallen asleep.

### ACT I**:** THE SEARCH FOR A HOME

\~~~

## Charlie

### APRIL

I sat back and watched as Skyler pulled the black gown over his head, fitting his small frame inside. His arms protruded out of the sleeves and then his ears popped up through the collar, but, his head couldn't fit through. He began to fumble around, whimpering softly, as he tried to pull his head through the collar. I laughed as I videotaped him with my retro Super8 movie camera that he had gotten me for my birthday two years ago.

"Charlie, help," Sky whined, reaching his arms to the back of his head.

"It's funny, with how small your head and body is, I'm surprised the gown wasn't loose on you." I stood up from my bed and walked up to him, placing my eye on the viewfinder as I filmed him.

"Are you filming me again?" I heard his muffled voice groan under the cotton material of the gown.

He looked so squirmish and helpless, the gown covering his face and the rest of his body except for his ears and arms. He hasn't changed one bit.

"I'm sorry, I can't help it."

I saw the figure underneath the gown turn its head at me. I could tell that behind the clothing, Sky had an expression of annoyance with me.

"You're in love with that thing, I should've never bought it for you," Sky joked, still trying to reach for the zipper on the back of the gown collar.

"It's so nice," I complimented, still busy filming his struggle. "It's so vintage and aesthetic and perfect for antique filmography. I love using it because it feels like memories on film. I can document whatever I want, and, someday in the future, I can cut all that footage together and make a documentary about it, who knows‚Äî"

"Just, shut up with your movie-connoisseur-talk and help me!"

I stopped rolling and placed the camera down on Sky's bed, immediately rushing to Sky's aid. I grabbed the zipper on the back of the gown's collar and unzipped it accordingly. Sky then fit his head through as the gown fell around his shoulders. Then, I zipped it back up.

"Thank you," Sky sighed, stepping in front of the mirror.

It was one of the only things left in our bedroom. Everything else was shoved into boxes and ready to be moved out. They were already in the trunks of our cars.

Today is our last day in this apartment.

"It's funny," Sky chuckled, "The color of the gown looks so dark and bruting to me, even though four years ago, all I did was wear black."

That's one thing about Skyler that's changed.

He's way more himself now. He's more free and unburdened.

He wears what he wants now, not just black colors to fit in with society. He had told me that black was a neutral color; It didn't say or imply anything, it was directly in the middle, and, if not, more appealing than plain white. He wore it because he didn't want to get bullied or harassed. In high school, he wore bright colors for a bit and he had gotten hazed for it. I never understood why, but now Sky has grown out of that fear. He wears bright colors whenever he wants.

He also made some changes to his appearance, such as dyeing a few more strands of his fur pink and getting his ears pierced. He has these two cute little matte black rings on the curve of his right ear. He wears more necklaces and bracelets, too.

He's also become more feminine. His voice has gotten a little bit higher over the years (juxtaposed to my voice, which has gotten deeper), and he has a more girly disposition.

Sky has made a lot more friends, all being female, (Jonathan and I are, like, his only male friends), and has opened up by a wide margin.

Though he still has difficulties dealing with his trauma and emotions, I'm very happy with his progress and I feel like a proud boyfriend.

_Well, I hope I won't be his boyfriend any longer... Because, I've been getting ideas‚Äî_

"How do I look?" Sky asked, turning to me.

It took me a few moments to really sink into his attire. I smiled sweetly and reached for the cap on his bed, placing it on his head. On the top of the cap, Sky had decorated the square with pink, blue, and purple watercolor.

"You look beautiful, as always," I smirked, gently smacking the Mortarboard tassel to the right side of the cap. "Stand there," I instructed, picking up the Super 8.

"Oh, my god," Sky scoffed, standing awkwardly as I taped him. "I hate it when you film me. I told you, I don't like being on camera."

"This is all private, Kitten, I swear. Only for me."

"Give me that," Sky demanded, taking the Super8 and turning it around to face me. "See, you look just as cute!"

"I'm not cute, I'm handsome," I boasted, jokingly posing in my gown and cap for the camera as Sky laughed at my performance.

"You're cute, don't deny it."

"I'm actually reaching for a different kind of word."

"Huh?" Sky furrowed his brow, looking at me.

"A different word."

"Handsome?"

"No, a little... higher..?"

"...Appealing?"

"Less serious, more..."

"More, what? More attractive?"

"More huggable, lovable, you know..."

Sky sighed and rolled his eyes.

"...Adorable?"

"There it is." I began to laugh hysterically as I took the Super 8 back from him, picking Sky up in my arms, bridal style, in the process. Sky cringed and facepalmed as I twirled him around, carrying him throughout the spaces of the empty room.

Suddenly and without warning, the door opened and Jonathan stood there, watching us mingle.

"Hey, you two," He grasped our attention. I didn't put Sky down, which always aggravated him. Skyler can have two kinds of mad: adorable mad, or, terrifying mad. "Amber's in twenty. Claire and I packed our car and are heading out now. Meet us and Becca there. Don't be late."

"Alright, newlywed," I mocked as he closed the door behind us.

I put Sky down and he fixed the gown back into place, collecting himself.

"Remember when something similar to this happened the morning after we kissed for the first time?" I recalled, looking around the room, soaking in the nostalgia as it leaped freely off the walls. "It looks so different empty, this room. I've never seen it completely vacant."

"Surely, when you first moved in‚Äî"

"No, I moved in after you, remember?"

"Oh," Sky nodded, standing next to me as I scanned the unoccupied, desolate bedroom. The walls were completely bare and painted plain white, the bedframes had only mattresses adorning them, the desks and drawers were stripped of our belongings; everything was gone. Good thing I had gotten the bedroom on tape once it was fully decorated a few months ago. We constantly added things to our bedroom: paint, photos, drawings, etc. We made it our home.

And now, it was time to say goodbye.

"Take one last look, Sky," I told him, admiring the bedroom. A key component to our lives, our relationship.

"I've taken a million last-looks. I keep thinking it'll be the final one, but I just keep wanting to take one more. It's so hard to say goodbye."

Without looking, my hand interlocked with his.

He turned his head up to me, his eyes compassionate and kind. They have that sort of glow. A glow that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.

He leaned up on the tip of his toes and planted a kiss on my muzzle.

I returned it, graciously. Sky wrapped his arms around my shoulders, his paws meeting and hooking onto the back of my neck. It only felt right, one last kiss along with our one last look. A great send-off to the room that made us the most precious memories.

"Goodbye, bedroom," Sky spoke, joined by an army salute, taking my hand and leading me out. "Let's get out of here."

Once we were in the hallway, I closed the door to the room behind us, slowly and carefully. It was like the house had a soul of its own, and Sky and I wanted to treat it with the utmost respect.

We walked down the carpeted hallway.

"Goodbye, hallway," Sky spoke again.

"Goodbye, stairs," He said, once more, as we walked down the stairs to the living room.

"Goodbye, living room, kitchen..."

The house was fully empty. We had all moved out of it; packed our bags and our boxes, and shoved them into our cars.

"Goodbye, apartment," Sky and I said in unison as we stared at the interior of the house, our backs to the front door.

Sky and I turned and looked at, said, front door, ready to leave it all behind.

Skyler took sunglasses out of his pocket from under his gown and placed them over his eyes. I chuckled at the sight.

We then nodded at each other, opened the doors, and left for the final time.

\~~~

"We're both very thankful for everything you've done for us, Sky," Henri Amber complimented kindly as he took Skyler's apron out of his hands.

"And I'm thankful that you gave me, well, a second home here in Cloverland," Sky responded, holding his paws together.

At least, that was all I could make out of their dialogue. Reading lips was never a skill of mine. I sat in the back of Amber's with Becca, Jonathan, and Claire, watching Sky strike up a conversation with Henri Amber and his wife. He laughed many times, put his palms together and clapped his fingers together softly, bowed... Everything he does is so cute.

I looked around the coffee shop, realizing how much it has changed in the past four years as well. It's certainly gotten bigger, the front counter was moved to the left side of the room, there's an outside seating area, tables and chairs have been renovated to display a more cohesive theme...

I then noticed that Sky was coming over with a tray occupied by five milkshakes, sat neatly in a circle.

"I thought you were officially off-duty, Sky," I mocked as he placed the tray of drinks on the coffee table in front of us. The one thing that didn't change in the establishment was the couch, chairs, and coffee table in the back of the room. Sky says he had nothing to do with it, but I'm certain he persuaded Henri not to renovate this area, since it was 'our' spot.

"One last task to finish off my cashier, slash, barista job for good!" Sky exclaimed as he passed out the individual shakes to all of us. "All on me."

"Aw, thanks, Sky!" Claire thanked excitedly as she stood up and hugged Sky before she could take her drink from his paw. Sky hugged her back, their arms squeezing tight around each other.

"I feel bad that we, sort of, left you here," Becca whined as she took her drink.

"Oh, it's okay, it was my choice," Sky responded as Claire sat back down on the couch, snuggling up to Jonathan's side. He put his arm around Claire's back and kissed her cheek. They love to show off the fact that they had gotten married. I bet their honeymoon was _eventful_.

I took my drink and looked down at the chocolate shake, fully prepared to slurp up the sugary liquid through the red-and-white-striped straw.

"I just wanted to make a quick speech," Sky took his pink, likely strawberry shake‚Äîconsidering that there was a strawberry punctured on the rim of the glass‚Äîand held it in the air. We all stood up with him and did the same, accordingly. "The past four years of college have probably been the most stressful, painful, torturous four years of our lives, so... here's to fucking surviving."

We all chuckled in response to Sky swearing. It barely happens, but when it does in fact occur, it's fucking awesome.

"To fucking surviving," We all repeated contently.

We clinked our drinks together and cheered, laughing as we placed the striped straws in our mouths and sipped the milkshakes.

We all sat down, Sky joining my side on the couch. I dipped my finger in my shake and touched it to Sky's nose. His eyes crossed comically as he tried to lick it off with his tongue, but it was too short to reach. I giggled as he glared at me, wiping the drop of chocolate milkshake off of his nose and putting it in his mouth.

"So, what's the plan, guys?" Claire spoke up. She was always the one bringing up new topics for our group to communicate over.

"We should be asking you two that," Becca joked, sipping her milkshake.

"Yeah, what now, moving out and moving on? Starting a family?" I added on.

"Woah, woah, woah, we've only just started, Charlie," Jonathan cackled, holding his paw out at me. "No need to move so quickly."

Claire looked at Jonathan, her reaction a little off-kilter. She seemed kind of put off by his response, but she claimed her smile back immediately once she had said, "What about you two?"

I put the strange reaction to the side. Probably nothing to worry about.

"Well..." I looked at Sky, not knowing what to say or how to say it. "We're gonna go home for about a week and settle in... and then I'm going to move to Cali for my career... Sky's gonna stay home and take care of his dad and Calico..."

"You guys are planning on doing long-distance?" Becca questioned.

Me and Sky stared at each other awkwardly. We were never dead-set on our choices.

"We'll make it work," Sky assured, nodding his head. "In the meantime, tell us about your career, Charlie."

"Well, as you know, we wrapped the last film a few months ago. I didn't get to fully focus on it because of school, but, after graduation, I'm hoping I can get a good job and work full time. I put my services out there, along with a portfolio of my work, so, for now, it's just the waiting game. Who knows, maybe some big director will notice me and pick me up for their next movie."

"I'm excited to see where you're headed in your career, Charlie," Jonathan complimented. "In the meantime, I still don't understand taxes."

We all laughed out loud. Milkshake almost came out through my nose. I guess that's karma after what I did to Sky.  
  
  

Once we were done sharing our plans after college, it was time.

We all looked at the clock, hoping our conversation didn't run overlong and we weren't late.

1:45. We were safe.

We all gathered our things and got ready to leave.

Becca, Claire, and Jonathan left Amber's without realizing it was their final time in the establishment. It didn't mean as much to them as it did to us.

Me and Sky stood back before escaping out the glass door entrance.

"So many goodbyes, today..." Sky muttered, turning around and taking another last look at the coffee shop. He took it in, calmly and carefully.

"Well, it is graduation day..."

"I hate saying goodbye."

"Well, remember, Sky, it's better than not saying anything."

We looked at the interior of Amber's for a final time, another significant location in our relationship.

"Goodbye, Amber's," Sky whispered.

We turned around and faced the doors.

Our fingers came close together, intertwining our hands. I squeezed his paw tightly, wanting to give him as much strength as possible.

What lead beyond those doors was the last location we would meet in our entire college experience. The last of all the memories.

"You ready to head into the unknown, Skyler?"

"Hell no."

# 2. GRADUATION

\~~~

## Skyler

The walk of finality.

We all walked hand-in-hand down the sidewalk of the streets of Cloverland. We've come used to doing that whenever we would walk to places together, and the order was always, from left to right: Becca, Sky, Charlie, Jonathan, and Claire.

It was a warm day. We were already overheated since our gowns were all black, but we didn't mind it. The sun shone its blazing white rays through the green leaves of tree branches that swayed gracefully in the wind above us. Each opening the sun found through the leaves blinded my eyes, like tiny sparkles of light.

We looked around the brightly colored neighborhood to see other students on their way to the football field, dressed in black gowns and decorated caps.

This was it. This was our last chance to admire the beautiful, quaint town that had been our home for the past four years.

"Goodbye, Cloverland," I spoke under my breath, not expecting the others to hear.

"Goodbye, Cloverland," They all repeated, smiling at me with heartwarming support that you only get from the truest of friends.  

After a bit more quiet strolling, we could hear the ambiance of a noisy crowd of multitudinous people in the distance. We were getting close to the football field. Charlie let go of my paw and looked at his watch. 1:55. The ceremony started at 2.

I took his hand back, our fingers intertwining, and looked at him with that same support he had given me.

Before we knew it, there were animals everywhere, crowding the parking lot. I saw some families with parents holding outdated cameras, balloons, gift bags; all getting out of their cars and wearing faces of excitement and glee.¬†

As we headed through the entrance along with other animals and their families, we stopped and stood before the football field, taking in the view. We could see a stage set up in the middle of the field with a podium and multiple microphones, along with rows and rows of foldable chairs covering the vast majority of the field. On the bleachers sat hordes of family members and adults, all thrilled for the ceremony.

I spotted my mother and father in the audience. We had already seen each other once today. They had helped me pack my things from the apartment and file them into their car. They didn't take Cal because of the large crowds and loud noises.

We heard a screeching whistle from someone behind us. We all turned around to see an administrator waving her arm at us. There was this brick wall behind the bleachers that hid the graduates from the audience before the ceremony. It was where the teachers and professors would, one, make sure everyone was present and, two, put us all in order.

As The Breakfast Club, we all looked at each other, nodding our heads as we separated hands. We all ran behind the wall and got picked up by an administrator with a clipboard, directing us all where to go. Charlie and I were put right next to each other since our last names both began with C. We were ordered into a line based on last names with other graduates. I was before Charlie. Claire and Jonathan were close together, but not directly next to each other. Becca was in the far back. We all communicated through our Breakfast Club group chat, a way for us to stay connected even when we were apart.

After a few minutes of waiting, we could hear Dr. Dushell clear her throat over the microphone as the crowd noise slowly died down. I felt my body begin to grow weak, my hands shaking. There was too much adrenaline rushing through me. I took deep breaths, trying to contain myself.

I was then hit with a welcoming hug from behind, Charlie smothering me within his arms. He rested his chin on my head, his muzzle protruding through my ears. Another smile crept onto my face as I hinged my paws onto his arms, solidifying our embrace like a standing-up spooning session. My body began to regain its sturdiness as I melted into him like drying cement.

Dr. Dushell talked for a bit about our school, introduced other faculty members to the microphone, shared memories and highlights, and so on and so forth.

Then, she said, "I will now introduce to you your CIVA graduates!"

The graduation theme played honorably over the large speakers peached on either side of the stage. An array of applause sounded as the students in the front of the line‚Äîlast names beginning with A‚Äîrevealed themselves to the crowd and made their way to the football field. The Bs went, followed by the Cs. Charlie and I walked triumphantly across the turf of synthetic grass, waving to the animals clapping loudly on the bleachers on either side of us. We then escaped onto the field, following the line of graduates before us. Another administrator was there, rotating her arm with her index finger pointed out, signaling us where to sit. Charlie and I filed into a row and went down the aisle, finding two metal chairs with papers adorning them, reading, 'Charlie Cooperton' and 'Skyler Clawfield'. We took our seats, appropriately.

We spun around on our chairs to see the other students find their seats. We waved to Claire, Jonathan, and Becca, who were also smiling uncontrollably wide.¬†

Once everyone had been seated, the ceremony went on. One of the students in our college, Alana Wallace, who was a singer, came up to the podium and sang the National Anthem. After that, a member of the board came up to the podium and rambled on even more about the institution, the programs offered, and what it means to be a student at CIVA. She singled out many optimistic and complex words to display the community, such as 'altruism', 'intrepidity', 'ingenuity' and etcetera, etcetera...

That's when Becca was invited to the stage.

She was trusted with the duty of writing a student speech for the ceremony, considering all the advice she had given to so many people and her skills in writing.

Becca was so nervous about it. We had made sure to text her all sorts of comforting words to boost her confidence.

She walked up to the stage and made her way to the microphone. She unfolded her speech onto the podium. I could tell she was nervous, she looked exactly like me when I gave speeches: hands shaking, crooked smile, laughing awkwardly... _I love her too much._

Becca began her speech, stuttering and shaking in the beginning, but, as she went on, the more courageous she became, owning her words with a powerful grip like a leash, delivering us all sorts of inspiration and motivation. Towards the end of her lecture, tears had been streaming down her face, the same happening to me.

It was a beautiful speech.

She had talked about living life with a purpose and a passion and that you should never retire from doing what you love, a seemingly clich√© topic for a speech, but the metaphors and choices she made as an author were absolutely electrifying. The audience roared with support once she had made her final statement. She smiled through her tears. She laughed.

Laugh-crying. One of the best forms of laughter and crying there is.

She returned to her seat, and finally, the stage-walking sequence had begun.

Charlie squeezed my hand firmly as I rested my head on his shoulder.

Names had started to be called. I could hear different sections of the audience cheer as certain students walked onto the stage, obtaining their diplomas and their certificates and shaking hands. It amazed me how different each family sounded as they cheered, there was a lot of diversity in the audience and I adored each and every celebration.

It went from the As, to the Bs, and then, to the Cs.

In our row, we could see people sitting up and walking to the stage one by one. They each got up, the empty chairs making their way to us, student by student.

There were then only three people to my left.

"Naomi Carter."

Two people.

"Anna Cho."

One person left.

"Dorothy Clark."

I closed my eyes, knowing my name was next. I tilted my head at Charlie in that small moment of time between the last person's name and mine. He kissed my forehead and patted my back.

_I love him so much..._

"Skyler Clawfield."

  

Before anyone else could, my mother and my father screamed at the top of their lungs. They weren't as loud as the other families, considering it was only the two of them, but it was pretty distinguishable. Charlie clapped for me, like the rest of the students and adults on the field.

I stood up from my seat, but I didn't walk to the stage. The other students, Charlie included, looked at me with confusion as to why I wasn't moving.

That was until...

"Charlie Cooperton."

I held my paw out to Charlie, and he took it, happily. We both made our march to the stage together, hand in hand. I could hear other students cheering for us, some professors on the stage smiling. I could see Mr. Bateman clap and wink at me, his signature move. We've actually become pretty well-known in CIVA. I'll admit, that popularity mostly came from the incident that occurred my first year, but more people got to know me and Charlie, and now we're basically ruled as the cutest couple on campus. We initially wanted our relationship to be private, but, as always, secrets get out.

Though there was a lot of cheering for the two of us, I couldn't help but notice that there was a voice missing in the crowd. One that belonged to Charlie.

"You okay?" I asked him under my breath as we walked to the staircase that led to the stage.

"I'm perfect," Charlie leaned in and whispered. "I'm actually glad he isn't here."

I nodded my head, not knowing how to respond to that. I don't even know how I should feel about that.

_Whatever, just forget it, Sky. It's time to graduate._

As we walked onto the stage, I could feel my breathing get deeper. _Not quicker, deeper._ It's a weird feeling, like the oxygen inside your throat gets heavy and sinks down your neck into your stomach. It's a gut feeling.

_I'm nervous._

_Why am I nervous? Why should I feel nervous? This should be the best day of my life, and yet..._

_I'm scared._

I could see the student ahead of me take her diploma and shake hands. Time was running thin.

_There's not really a way out of this. I don't have a choice. What would be the point in running away? That's incredibly idiotic, but, for some reason, I started to consider it._

_I don't want to graduate..._

_I want to go back in time..._

_Four years ago... To the best year of my life..._

_I met Charlie. I met Claire, Jonathan, and Becca. I made friends. I fell in love._

_I felt safe._

_Now, as Charlie said before, we're crossing into the unknown._

_Did it all go to waste? Did I spend all those years without fulfilling my true potential?_

_Will I never be able to return to age eighteen again? Will I never be able to fall in love the way I did with Charlie again?_

_That year felt like a dream. A story. A novel._

_A perfect plot with a perfect ending. Perfect characters. A perfect relationship._

_A perfect life._

_But, now, we're on our own._

_I won't be able to return to that perfect romance story._

_But, maybe... I can make a new one._

_Yeah._

_Let's see where this goes._

_Let's hold out hope for just a little bit longer, Sky._

  

I walked across the stage a took my diploma out of Dr. Dushell's hands.

I shook Dr. Abraham's paw.

I shook Mrs. Gabrielle's paw.

I shook Mr. Bateman's paw.

Charlie did the same behind me.

I smiled at him.

I smiled at the audience.

I walked off the stage and moved my tassel to the left side of my cap.

I am now, officially, a college graduate.

I am now, officially, an adult.

\~~~

About half an hour after the ceremony ended, animals were scattered all over the field. Some friends were together cheering and screaming, popping bottles of champagne. Some families finally got to give their graduate sons and daughters their gifts and balloons and bouquets of flowers... That was what my mom had gotten me. A bouquet of roses.¬†

_I didn't know why she chose that specific item, since I usually assumed that flowers would go to the daughter... but maybe it can go to the son, too..?_¬†

Either way, they were a beautiful vibrant shade of deep red, they were fresh and had small dewdrops sprinkled on every velvety pedal, and they smelled oddly like ripe raspberries. I mean, I wasn't complaining. Mom took out a disposable camera and snapped a photo of me with the roses. Dad stood next to her. I could see it in his eyes that he was a proud father. It was an unspoken rule‚ÄîWell, more like an inside joke‚Äîbetween us that Mom was the only one who was allowed to go crazy over me, and that Dad would be the one who remained calm. He still followed that rule, and we both laughed on the inside, watching Mom scream her excited little head off as she hugged me and kissed my forehead a thousand times.

"I'm so, so, so, so proud of my boy!" She exclaimed as she tossed her arms around me, swaying back and forth.

"Mom, I get it, now back off!" I giggled as she parted herself from me, just to put her paws on my shoulders.

"Skyler," She spoke, sincerely. "Are you sure you want to stay at home?"

"Mom, we've talked about this for months. Yes, I want to stay home and help my family. It's my decision."

"But, don't you want to... you know... get out there? Live your life, your career as an artist? Like Charlie?"

"Mom. Please."

I could see the disappointment in her eyes. She nodded her head in withdrawal, taking her paws off my shoulders. I didn't like it when I had disagreements with my family. Especially with my mom. But, I could tell, my whole family didn't want me staying home. Even Cal didn't want me to and he's always the one begging me to stay one day longer during my breaks.

But, it was my choice.

My choice.

My mom wanted a photo of me and Charlie before we left for home, so I turned around and scanned the crowd for him. I couldn't see him anywhere, so I told my parents to wait as I looked for him.

I made my way, or should I say, _shoved_ my way through the ocean of parents and college graduates, looking for my pure-white husky.

That's when I saw him, over by the bleachers. Well, more like I saw his back. He was standing next to the metal railing on the area where you would walk onto the bleachers to find a seat. I ran over to said bleachers and walked up the stairs.

He had taken his gown and cap off and was looking out at the field.

_It's weird... Did he miraculously grow in height..?_

"Hey, Charlie?"

The husky turned and looked at me.¬†

_Not Charlie._

The man had a face similar to Charlie's but not quite. He had the same build, but was just a few inches taller and his fur was a little darker and scruffier. He was wearing a dusty plaid flannel and old, worn-out jeans. He seemed like a bit of a mess, but as I have learned, I can't judge a book by its cover.

His reaction to the name I had mistakenly spoken was strange. It looked like he had seen a ghost.

"Sorry, sir, wrong person," I stuttered awkwardly, turning to leave the bleachers.

"Wait," The man called, causing me to, in fact, wait. I turned back around, wondering what this guy wanted from me. His voice was eerily similar to Charlie's, just a little bit deeper. "You're Skyler, right? Skyler Caufield?"

"Clawfield," I corrected, my whole body now facing him. "How do you know my name?"

"Sky," I heard another voice come from behind me.

I turned my body for the third time and saw Charlie, looking at the man with a fierce glare.

"Go back to your parents. Give us some time alone, alright?" For every word in that sentence, he didn't face me at all. His eyes were glued onto the male husky. It was like he was talking to a brick wall, not acknowledging my presence, even though he was addressing me.

He kept glaring intimidatingly at the man.

I took one last look at the old husky before doing what Charlie had ordered.

I put the pieces together.

  

_Charlie's father._

\~~~

The sun was setting slowly in the sky. I had said goodbye to everyone: my professors, my classmates, my friends, Claire, Jonathan, Becca... I was all set to leave... but... all day, Charlie wasn't present. I tried to call and text him, but he didn't answer his phone.

I stood by my parents' car, waiting for Charlie.

He had promised that we'd have one last goodbye before separating.

"Sky, honey, we're running out of time," I heard my mom call to me in the driver's seat. The car was fully packed and ready to take off. My dad sat in the passenger seat, also looking for Charlie.

"Mom, I have to see him," I mumbled, my back against the back car door. "We promised we'd say goodbye."

"He's probably racing over as we speak," My dad assured us both.

"I don't know, Sky said it looked pretty intense between him and his father," I heard my mom whisper to my dad exclusively.¬†

"C'mon, Charlie, c'mon..." I anxiously whimpered to myself, tapping my foot, inspecting my surroundings.

The car was running, standing idle in the street outside of the apartment. I leaned my head forward onto the sidewalk, looking left and right.

"Honey, it'll be okay," My mother kept speaking words of encouragement, but they didn't work. _I was worried for Charlie. That really was his dad. And after everything he had told me about his father for the past four years, they are not a good combo._ "Skyler, sweetie, we have to go. We don't want to miss our flight."

"But, Charlie‚Äî"

"You can call him when we get to the airport. We really have to go. Please, Sky?"

I released a sigh of defeat and slowly opened the car door, reluctantly getting inside the automobile.

My mother looked back at me and smiled, trying to lift my spirits.

I tried my best to smile back, but I couldn't.

"You guys ready?" She asked, looking at both me and my dad.

I nodded. My dad agreed verbally.

My mother exhaled through her nose and faced the windshield, clicking in her seatbelt. She began to pull out of the parking spot and exit onto the road.

I turned my head to the right and saw as the apartment began to grow smaller as the distance between us grew bigger.

I could feel a tear stream down my cheek. I wiped it off immediately, not wanting my graduation day to be full of terrible emotions.

As my mother drove further down the narrow road, I watched the apartment in my vision grow smaller... and smaller... and smaller...

  

"STOP THE CAR!" I shouted.

My mom freaked out and slammed her foot to the break, the whole car halting abruptly, jolting all of us out of our seats, the seatbelt catching us.

Before my parents could ask what was wrong, I shoved the door open and leaped out of the car, running onto the sidewalk.

On the other end of the sidewalk, running in my direction, was what caused me to yell stop in the first place.

"Charlie!" I howled, my smile growing wide. He was smiling, too.

We both ran with the desire to hold each other one last time. I could tell how much he wanted me, just by the way he ran and the way he looked at me. The distance between us grew smaller and smaller, the mad dash ending with us colliding together into an embrace, tighter than any we've had before.

We wrapped our arms around each other. Charlie squeezed my entire torso and dug his claws into my back. I didn't mind it. He began to kiss my forehead repeatedly, much like my mom had done earlier.

"We promised that we'd say goodbye!" Charlie whined as he separated the hug, placing his paws on both sides of my head carefully.

"Where were you?"

"I had to... take care of a few things."

"Are you okay? What happened?"

"I'm fine, Sky. Why are you crying?"

I didn't even notice.

"I am? Oh, uh... I don't know why I'm crying," I chuckled, placing my paws to my cheeks, trying my best to eradicate every stream. "I guess... it's because... I don't know how to say goodbye to you, Charlie... but..."

"...Saying goodbye is ten times better than saying nothing at all." He finished my sentence.

"Are we really going to do this?" I stared into his eyes, wanting him to say something, anything that will make me feel confident in the choices and plans we had made. "Do you think we'll survive? Do you think our relationship will survive apart?"  

"I don't know, Sky."

I felt my whole body sink.

"Time's running out, I have a flight to board."

"Then go."

"I don't want to leave you."

"We'll call each other."

I looked around frantically, tears still staining my eyes. Charlie laughed softly as he tried to relax my jittery disposition. He kept brushing his paws through my fur, attempting to calm me down. _God, I'm such a cowardly cat._

"I don't want to say goodbye, Charlie."

"I don't want to, either."

"Then, let's not." I looked at him, an idea circling my head. "Let's not say goodbye."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, we're not exactly breaking up, are we?"

"Of course, not. That won't happen, not on my watch."

"So, let's promise that we'll never say goodbye, okay?" My paws clenched his arms as he held me. "I promise, Charlie."

"I promise, Skyler."¬†

"Let's just say... 'I'll see you soon'."

"Okay. Okay, Sky."

"Okay?"

"Okay. I'll see you soon, Sky."

"I'll see you soon, Charlie."

We touched our foreheads together, solidifying our connection, our bond.¬†

My parents' car pulled up next to us in the street. I saw a flash of light illuminate our surroundings like a surge of lightning. I looked to the right to see my mom, snapping a photo of us with the disposable camera from earlier.

"Got that photo I wanted," She smirked.

Charlie and I laughed, closing our eyes, touched the tips of our noses together.

My mom honked the horn, signaling me to get in. Charlie giggled and separated our snouts.

"I think it's time for you to go."

"I think so, too."

I couldn't leave just yet, though. I had to do one more thing.

I leaned up on my toes and planted a kiss on Charlie's muzzle.

He kissed me back, passionately.

Every kiss meant something to us.

We broke the kiss off with a heavy exhale.

That kiss was the deal we had made, finalized. That kiss was the promise.

"C'mon, Sky!" My mom laughed as she shouted at me.

We looked into each other's eyes.

From that moment on, I knew that we would be just fine.

  

I left him and got into the car.

My mother stepped on the gas, and the car zoomed off.

  

Charlie waved at me.

I waved back.

  

I watched as he grew smaller... and smaller... and smaller...

# 3. JUST FOR NOW

\~~~

## Charlie

...until he wasn't even visible in my sights anymore.

I watched as the car took away the only thing that made me feel safe and calm in this whole entire world, disappearing into the golden sunset.

_I'll see you soon, Sky._

"Hey!" I heard a deep, hoarse voice call from behind me.

I turned around to face him, jogging down the sidewalk after me, sweating and panting from the long distance he had covered to reach me.

_Hugo Alexander Cooperton._

_My father._

I waited impatiently for him to collect himself. He stood up, straightened his back, and stared straight at me.

He flashed a crooked smile.

It seemed like he was trying to make himself less menacing and more benevolent. He looked neither. I crossed my arms in defiance.

"The car's down the road," He pointed his thumb back behind him. "I packed your things. You ready to go, sport?"

Without a word, I walked past him, towards the car, my shoulder brushing past his.

"Charlie..." He sighed, following me.

"Don't call me sport."

"I'm trying, okay?"

"You had twenty years to try, so what if one year in prison changes you. You were still a horrible parent and a disgusting father figure, and you can't come back from that."

I felt my father's large and hefty paw touch my shoulder.

"Charles, I've said it a thousand times, I'm sorry‚Äî"

I smacked his paw off of my back and turned my body to him, ferociously.

"Don't you dare call me Charles," I barked, pointing my finger at him, subjectively. "That was mom's thing. It was never yours."

I immediately left him on the sidewalk, looking for my car that he had supposedly packed.

After a bit of walking, I saw the Mini Cooper double-parked next to a Chevy on the street outside of some other apartment, a few houses down from me and Sky's former one.

"I can drive if you want," Hugo gestured as I walked over to the driver's seat, opening the car door.

"I don't need your gestures of goodwill." I darted my head up at him before entering the automobile. The look on his face made it seem like he was ashamed of himself. _Keyword: seem. My father was always the master of deception._ "You've already said your piece today, and now I want you to be silent this entire car ride."

"But‚Äî"

"Stop!" I growled, slamming my hand on the car roof viciously.

My father flinched at the action. I looked at my paw, feeling the pain surge from the impact of the metal onto my skin and fur. I tightened it into a fist, squeezing the pain away. I regained my control and looked back at him.

"Just... get in the car, and please leave me alone."

He nodded, exhaling through his nose with dismay. We both got into the car, shutting the doors with a metallic clunk. I twisted my body around to see that the car was, in fact, packed and ready to drive off. I started the car and began to pull out of the parking spot, escaping onto the road. As I drove down the concrete path, I turned my attention to the right side of my vision for a split second. The apartment passed by my sights before I could take one last look at it. I was so distracted by my hatred for my father that it had ruined my last moment with the apartment that had changed my life.

I set my attention back on the road ahead. The sunset in the distance was irritating my eyes, so I pulled down the sun visor to block its shine. Too bad, it was a nice view. If only it didn't have to hurt looking at it.

"Who taught you to drive?" My father asked.

"Jonathan taught me. Five years ago."

"You're good at it. You know everything."

"Astonishing, huh?"

I heard my father sigh again, smacking his lips in annoyance. I didn't care if I was vexing him. He deserved to understand that feeling of constant disappointment. But, if he's gonna keep doing that the whole drive home, lord have fucking mercy.

I don't even know how we'll survive a whole week together.

\~~~

Returning to the old house was not a pleasant journey. Though it was what I wanted, the silence that remained between us the entire car ride was probably the most uncomfortable four hours of my life.

It was eleven at night once we had gotten to my childhood home. Entering it, tired as hell, I didn't care to turn on any of the lights or bring in the stuff from the car. I decided to do it tomorrow morning. I left my father in the car, storming into my old room. I made my way through the darkness, knowing the path to my bed since I had grown up in these hallways and doorframes my whole life.

I flopped into bed, my head hitting the pillow. I didn't feel the need to admire my old bedroom or bring back any nostalgic thoughts. I just wanted to sleep.

_It didn't feel right, sleeping without Sky... but I had to get used to it._

_It's only a week._

_It's only a week..._

I heard the door open behind me. My father knocked on it as he poked his head in through the doorway.

I wanted to say some pessimistic remark along the lines of, 'If you're gonna open the door first, don't bother knocking,' or some shit like that, but I was too exhausted to be mean.

"You all settled in?" He asked quietly.

"Mhm," I mumbled into the pillow.

"Are you sure you don't want any extra blankets or pillows or anything?"

I had only one pillow and one cloth blanket on the bed, since it hadn't been slept in for a while.

"I'll be fine," I muttered, suppressing my yawn.

"You will?"

"It's just for now."

"It's going to be a whole week."

"Just for now."

My father went quiet.

He then closed the door behind him, a little passive-aggressive. He could get angry for all I care. I've learned to resist his punishments. Either way, it'll prove to me that this whole 'nice guy' phase is just an act that he's putting on. Prove to me that I was right and that he'll never be able to change. Prove to me that I shouldn't hold out hope, because it'll just be another disappointment waiting to happen. Just like all the other times.

_Ugh, I really wish Sky were here..._

I pulled out my phone from the back pocket of my jeans with my flimsy, sleep-deprived limbs. My arm flopped down on the bed, my hand, holding the phone, collapsing down beside my head.

I clicked the on-button on the phone, the brightness almost blinding me. I hastily swiped open the control center and dialed it down so I wasn't visually impaired.

My hand was beginning to die on me, so I slowly limped my shaky finger over to the Messages app, my claw making a tapping sound to the screen as I pressed the icon, opening a text thread with my boyfriend. The contact info read 'Skyler' with two pink and blue heart emojis. The contact photo was of my favorite picture of him. Sky rarely let me take photos of him, or let _anyone_ in that case.

The photo I had set was the only time he had let me photograph him. It was one I took four years ago.

_I remember it like it was yesterday..._

\~~~

**JANUARY**

Sky and I were laying in bed, the morning after our first Christmas together. It was the first day of the new year.

The morning after I had found my place in the world.

For some reason, during that winter I had spent at his parents' house, the sun shined almost every morning, even if it were snowing. But that specific morning, it was cloudy. The window in Sky's room showed a gray-scaled environment. No bright colors or accents. Just gray.

But, it didn't change anything about how I felt.  

I was so happy. I was so happy to be waking up to him, in his bed, in his childhood home.

It was everything I wanted.

And a _cloudy sky_ could not ruin my time with _my Sky_. Not one bit.

"Hey, cutie," I had whispered under my breath as Sky was just waking up.

He had smiled at me without opening his eyes.

"Hi, Charlie," He had responded, the same volume as I had spoken in.

"You have no idea how beautiful you are."

"I'm not beautiful," Sky blushed, hiding his face with his paws.

"No, you are."

"Shut up."

"Why won't you accept my compliments?"

"I hate you."

"I wish you could see how I see you."

"God, I'd love to see me from your point of view."

"You see, Sky, there's only one way you could truly understand my perspective."

"What's that?"

I turned around in the bed, reaching for my luggage that was on the floor, next to the blown-up air mattress that I hadn't been sleeping in. I shoved my hand quickly inside, pulling out my camera.

"What are you doing?" Sky wondered, his eyes now open. _They were so curious, innocent, unknowing... The way they moved to try and understand what I was up to... The way you could see visually what he was thinking through the way his eyes darted around..._

"Just let me take one photo."

"Charlie..." He both giggled and sighed at the same time.

"Let me show you how beautiful you are."

"This is the only exception, alright?"

"Alright."

"I'm only allowing you to do this once."

"Of course. Just for now."

Sky let out another breathy laugh.

"What do you want me to do?"

"Just lie there. Don't move."

"Okay, Charlie."

\~~~

_Now, looking at that contact photo..._

_I wanted to cry so badly..._

_But, I just couldn't._

I held it in.

For Skyler, it's so easy to cry. For me, it's so hard.

It takes so much energy to cry. It's exhausting.

I tapped on the message box, pulling up the keyboard.

I slid my finger across the keyboard one-handedly, using the swipe mechanism to type words faster and more efficiently.

"I love you, Skyler."

It was a simple sentence. But, it said so much.

I tapped the arrow button, sending the message to him.

I clicked the button on the side of the phone, shutting it off, submerging me back into the dark confines of my bedroom. At last, I felt at peace enough to go to sleep.

\~~~

The next morning, I woke up to a sun-lit bedroom. Last night, I never got the chance to see what it looked like after all this time. It was still completely empty. Neither my father nor I made the effort to fill it. I mean, what was the point? I didn't live here anymore and there was no purpose for my father to do anything to it. He had already thrown away all my remaining furniture and objects once I had fled home in a fit of rage. There's nothing _to_ fill the room with.

I didn't want to leave my room because that meant having to face him again. But I couldn't do nothing all day, so I left anyway.

Walking through the hallways, I realized how much the house had changed, now in the daylight. Things were rearranged, some tables and couches were moved, some new decor was put up... It didn't feel like home. _To be honest, the house never felt like home, who was I kidding?_

In the past four years, I had only been here a total of nine times. The reasons are as follows: I had to retrieve something I left, I had to meet with my father unwillingly for financial issues, or I had nowhere else to stay the night. Every time I did return home, every second that passed in this house, I wanted to leave.

Before exiting into the living room, I looked at the haunting vase-like object on the mini-table that stood to the side of the hallway. Every time I looked at that vase, my body would stiffen.

_It's my mother's ashes._

I didn't want to stare at it any longer, afraid doubtful or emotional feelings would overcome me. I immediately walked past the urn, not batting an eye for a moment longer.

Entering the living room, I saw my father asleep on the recliner chair, a blanket over him.

_Was... he waiting for me to wake up?_

I turned to the front door, remembering that I never unpacked the car from last night.

I looked around the house for the car keys, realizing that they were in my pants pocket. I didn't bother to change out of my clothes or brush my teeth or shower or anything at all last night. I face-palmed in annoyance and exited out the front door, no socks nor shoes adorning my feet.

It was a slightly warm, slightly cold summer morning. The first day of being an adult, apparently.

I thought it would feel much more victorious than this.

I scuttled my bare feet down the stone path in front, making my way to the Mini Cooper that sat in the driveway next to my father's car. I stepped on a few pebbles and twigs, but nothing truly painful.

I unlocked the car with a press of the keys and opened the trunk, taking my backpack out. I fit my arms through the flaps of the bag, wearing it on my back. I took another look at the rest of the stuff in the trunk.

_I'll unpack the rest later... or never..._

After getting back inside, I took a long, hot shower and freshened up for the day. I spent the rest of the morning back in my room, a croissant in my mouth that I had snagged from the kitchen, along with a fresh hot cup of coffee placed beside me on the bed, working my laptop. I was researching job listings in LA just in case no one decided to hire me for my work. A fallback plan just in case this whole film thing flops. I also searched for houses to possibly rent or purchase in full. I can't live in LA and not have a place to live.

\~~~

A few hours later, walking back into the living room, I saw my father setting up plates in the dining room. I walked across the room, peeking my head in through the doorway that led to the dining room. My dad spotted me in the corner of his eye, turning his head to me abruptly as if he were startled by my presence.

"Hey, bud," He stammered, standing up straight. "Made us some lunch."

I looked at the table, seeing two BLT sandwiches on two white ceramic plates in front of two chairs, which sat next to each other by the table.

"Thanks," I mumbled, walking over to one of the plates, grabbing the edge, and sliding it a chair space down, so we didn't have to sit next to each other. I sat down on the cushioned chair, grabbing the sandwich with two hands.

My father sighed as he sat in the chair that was now one seat away from mine.

_I mean, I guess he was trying... I don't know how long it'll last, but... I can choose not to be a dick sometimes._

_I still don't trust him._

I began to dig in, pulling out my phone to distract myself while I ate.

I could tell my father wanted to strike up a conversation, like any normal father would do.

I just waited for him to say something.

But, he had no idea what to say. He still doesn't understand me and what I like to talk about. He never did.

"So, how's, uh... how's Skyler?"

I stopped chewing and glanced at him.

"What?" I spoke through the bite of BLT in my mouth.

"How is he?"

I swallowed the bite. "Why do you care?"

"Just checking in on my son's... love life..."

The awkward hesitation in-between 'son' and 'love life' made me even more suspicious. Apparently, he's not homophobic anymore. It's a little hard to believe.

"He's fine."

"How long have you two been together, now? Like, four years?"

"Well, not exactly four years, we've had plenty of breakups."

"Ah, I see. It's just sort of on and off?"

"...Sorta."

"Um... Still in touch with Cassie?"

"Yeah, she's doing good, why?"

"How's Jonathan?"

"Why are you asking so many questions about how other people are and not me?"

"Would you like me to?"

"What kind of question is that?"

"Well, I'm just saying, last time I tried to ask questions about your life, you locked up on me."  

"For a good reason."

"So, do you want me to ask about your life or not?"

"I don't know, you make that decision, I couldn't care less."

"See, look, what you're doing right now is not fair."

_'Not fair'? Are we fucking children?_

"What do you mean?" I crossed my arms, sitting back in the chair, interested in what he had to say.

"I'm just saying, I try to ask about your life, you shut me away, I try to ask about your friends, you misdirect the conversation."

_Then how about you don't talk to me at all?_

I decided to keep that one to myself.

I shook my head, pushing his sentence to the side, getting back to the sandwich. I examined the bread and the fillings inside, searching for where to take my next bite. Before I was able to sink my teeth in, my phone began to vibrate on the table.

It startled both me and my dad. We were already on the brink of exploding into another heated argument, built up from the tense atmosphere we were in. The phone ringing was almost a relief.

I grabbed my phone, looking at the caller ID. It was from an unknown number, but the location read, "Los Angeles, California". I could feel my gut sink in both excitement and anticipation.

"You want to take that?" My father suggested.

I grabbed my phone without any reply to my father, answering the call and leaving the room for a moment.

I began to pay close attention as the woman on the other line answered. Her name was Amy. She had asked if she was correct in calling Charlie Cooperton, and I confirmed her guess. She then shared some news with me.

Some good news.

_Some pretty fucking fantastic news._  
  
  
  
  
  

"HOLY SHIT!" I screamed with glee once the woman on the other end had hung up.

I ran back into the dining room, jumping up and down with excitement, giggling profusely. My father had the last bite of his sandwich stuffed into his mouth. He looked at my jubilation, caught off guard by the sudden joy.

"Language. What happened?" He said through a clogged mouth of BLT, choking it down.

"I got hired!" I laughed, smiling, throwing my hands up. This will probably be my happiest moment in this house.

"Hired? For what?"

"For my next production!" I placed my hands on the table, trying to show my father the importance of this new job through my body language. "I got hired as the fucking director of photography for, get this, Deno Yuvi's next movie!"

"Language," My father warned again. "Who's Deno Yuvi?"

"Dad, seriously?" I scoffed, sitting back down in the chair I pulled. "He's, like, one of the most popular breakout indie film directors working in cinema to date!"

"What does indie mean?"

"Independent, dad!"

"And you're the... what again?"

"Director. Of. Pho-fucking-tography." I spoke every syllable of that sentence with a slap of my paw to the table.

"What does that mean?"

"It means I'm not working as just plain crew anymore! I'm the head cinematographer! Chief over cameras! I get to actually be behind the camera and shoot a movie the way I want! Or the way Mr. Yuvi wants, but I'm sure I'll have creative license in choosing the look of the film."

"Huh."

That deadpan reaction lowered my mood just a bit. The smile was still on my face, yet the glimmer in my eyes was now gone.

"Seriously? That's it?"

"Well, I, just, I don't understand the excitement."

That's when my smile left my face.

"Why can't you just be happy for me?"

"Oh, no, of course, I am, I just never understood the interest in movies and stuff."

"I was always into movies. Photography and film, that was always my interest, dad."

"What about architecture? You used to do that."

"That was only because you forced me to. You made me help out with your job, you made me do construction labor. At age sixteen. I never liked architecture, you just assumed I did because that was your passion. This is mine, dad."

My father went quiet. He didn't know what to say.

"Dad, did you even see the film I made with Jonathan and Rue?"

"You made a film?"

"I sent you an email."

"You sent me an email?"  

"Yeah, I knew that even though we didn't have the best relationship, it still felt vital that I sent you my first real project. It was important to me. And I thought that maybe it would be important to you."

"Well, maybe if you had told me personally about your interests, like I had tried to ask about many times before, then maybe I would be up-to-date with this whole... Quentin Tarantino fantasy."

"Wait, wait, hold on, what the fuck?"

"Language."

"First of all, it's not a fantasy, it's my fucking career. And second, I have been telling you about my interests. But you never listened. That's why I'm so angry with you. That's my whole argument." I began to laugh in sarcasm. "That's the fucking thesis statement, dad, what the fuck do you mean I haven't?"

"Language!"

"You can't just twist the conversation around. You can't twist the truth." I scoffed again, rubbing my forehead with my fingers. "Here, in case you mixed it up, here's the truth: I've been trying to get you to know my interests my whole life. You never paid attention‚Äî"

"Back then I didn't, I meant now. Right now, I'm trying to know your interests."

"You say that but you'll always get the same answer from me. Why didn't you fucking pay attention before?"

"I was different before, I'm trying to get better now. That's why I'm trying to ask about your interests now, but you don't let me."

"Fuck that."

"Language!" I could see my father begin to grow more and more irritated. "You're not allowing me to get to you, Charlie. Like I said before, I try to ask about your life, you shut me away, I try to ask about your friends, you misdirect the conversation‚ÄîI'm trying to get to know you, Charlie, why won't you let me try?"

"You say 'get to know me' as if we've just met. I've known you my entire fucking life. You should have a good idea of who I am right about now. But you don't. You never bothered to pay attention when I was younger. You never bothered to try."

"Charlie, I'm trying now. Would you please let me try now?"

"I've given you unlimited second chances when I was younger, so why _should_ I let you try now?"

"Charlie, please! I want to turn my life around. But I can't do that if you won't let me‚Äî"

"There are so many times I've wanted you to change!" I stood up from the chair slowly, standing my ground. "I used to have a mountain of hope on my back, but every time you failed to meet my simple expectations, you crumbled that mountain. You crumbled my hope. You crumbled me. What's different now? How do I know you won't fall back into drinking and alcohol and assault me like you've done a million times before?"

"Charlie..." A low growl came from the bottom of his throat. He was beginning to crack.

"You were a terrible person. Your whole life, not just with me, not just after mom died, you were _always_ a terrible person. I used to believe that you and mom were happy and perfect and everything I could've wanted in parents. I used to believe that you turned out the way you did because mom died. That it wasn't your fault. That you could change. But then, that Thanksgiving dinner, Beth told me who you were when you were younger. She exposed your secret past. You were manipulative. You manipulated her. You were evil. You were _always_ a terrible fucking person!"

"LANGUAGE!" He growled back, slamming his fist on the table, the plates and silverware clinking as they bounced from the impact. His anger was beginning to return.

_I knew it._

_Every time I think he's changed, that monster inside of him always peeks out._

"There it is," I chuckled monotonously, staring my father down. "There's the real Hugo Cooperton. You may think you're doing better, but your secrets will always come out. Everything that you've done, it follows you." I began to laugh even more. _Fuck, I felt like a psychopath, but this rant I was on wasn't stopping anytime soon. It felt good and bad to let it all out. I felt insane._

"You thought you could get off scot-free for stealing another company's blueprints to make yourself seem like such a great architect? Well, look what happened. You got arrested and went to fucking jail. And now you want to have a moral fucking high ground? After everything you've done? For fuck's sake, dad! You can get good lawyers to lessen your sentences but you can't use a lawyer to get your own son to forgive you for how you treated him."

I walked away from the table, leaving my BLT with only one bite taken from it. I walked away from my father, who glared at me with angst and a rising hatred. I walked away from the dining room, then the living room, storming back through the hallways, back into my empty room.

"Where are you going?!" I heard my father call with anger as he chased after me.

I tried to slam the door shut behind me with a dramatic thud, but my father had intercepted, shoving it back open with his arm, before it could hit the door frame. He watched, rage building up inside of him, as I grabbed my laptop and began to pull up a website that listed the prices for airplane tickets and the earliest departures.

"What are you doing?" He asked in a low voice, trying to contain his anger.

"I'm leaving."

"What?"

"I can't stay here, Hugo."

"What do you mean?"

"It means I'm fucking leaving and staying somewhere else."

With a click of the touchpad, I had purchased myself a plane ticket that took off in about an hour and a half.

"Where else can you go?"

"I have a place."

"Where?"

"Skyler's."

"You're going to Skyler's?"

"Well, apart from here, I feel comfortable there and his parents welcome me and actually care about me, acknowledge me, talk to me, understand me, treat me like I'm loved‚ÄîFive fucking things that you could never be capable of."

I shut my laptop and shoved it into my backpack. It was all I had brought into the house, so I was basically already all set to leave. I grabbed my shoes and jumped into them, tying the shoelaces at lightspeed.

"Charlie, please, just stay one more day."

"Too late, already bought a ticket."

I picked up my phone, keys, and other small belongings. I pushed past my father and walked down the hallway. My father frantically chased after me, again.

"Charlie, please, don't go yet, let me make it up to you."

"It's funny, I don't even need to get ready or anything, I've always been ready to leave, that's how I've always felt when I've been here. Ready to leave."

"Charlie! Please!"

"Hugo, trust me, I'm doing us a favor. We would tear each other apart in less than a week, so it's better I go now."

I opened the front door, taking my car keys out of my pocket. I entered the, now sunnier, outside environment, feeling the wind blaze past as I walked hastily to the car. I held down the unlock button, my Mini Cooper beeping, ready for me to board. Hugo followed me out to the car.

"I'll change! I swear to God, I'll change! I'll be better!"

"That's good, but for now, I just need space," I informed him, opening the car door and sitting in the driver's seat, closing it behind me.

_I'll admit it, I felt bad. By the way my father was begging instead of fighting me, I started to wonder whether he really was trying to change._

_Whatever was going on with him, I couldn't deal with it right now. I just need space._

My dad pressed his hands up against the window.

"Charlie, please come back inside. Please, don't do this."

I lowered the window.

"Hugo. Dad," I spoke sincerely before starting up the car. "I know you're trying. But, please, understand where I'm coming from and understand why I feel this way. I don't know if I'll ever be able to face you, but if I must, I need time."

"I've been waiting to right my wrongs since I got out of prison! You've had three years!"

"And you had twenty."

I started the car and placed my paws on the wheel.

"I'll see you soon, Hugo."  
  
  

_My dad could see it in my eyes._

_There was nothing he could do that could make me stop the car and come back into the house._

_It was better for him to accept defeat. To try again another time._

He nodded his head, demolished by my words.

I could see tears in his eyes.  
  
  

_'I'm sorry.'_

_A simple sentence that meant so much._

_But neither of us said it._  
  
  

I pulled out of the driveway and left my father, standing alone on the front yard of my childhood home.

_I'll see you soon, dad._

# 4. FIGHTING WITH LOVE

\~~~

## Skyler

It was a late night. I could hear the muffled voices of my parents arguing in their bedroom. Well, they never really argued, it was more like they were verbally worrying about each other. They were too in love to argue fully. Every time they did 'argue', they fought over their care for each other. It was never anything else. It was always a sophisticated, more enhanced, adult version of the 'I love you more' battle that you would have with a special other.

I stood in the doorway that led to my own room, my hand on the door frame, peeking out. I watched from down the hall, observing as they fought through the open sliver of their doorway. My dad was in the bed, a box of tissues next to him, his nose red. My mother stood between the bed and the door, her back facing me. I could hear her shaky breath as she touched her paw to her face, covering it anxiously, her opposing arm wrapped around her waist.

"I told you it was a bad idea," I heard my mother whisper.

"I didn't want to miss my own son's graduation," My father whispered back.

"You should've stayed home. You should've stayed in bed."

"I'm fine, Olympia. I swear."

"You're not fine! You're getting worse!" I could hear the sadness and worry in her voice. She was probably crying. Me and my mom sounded similar when we cried.

"Olympia..." My father sighed, shaking his head. "I love you. I'll get better. From now on, I'll stay in bed, okay? From now on, I will. I just didn't want to miss Sky's graduation‚Äî"

That was when my father's eyes landed on me, the eye contact hitting me like a laser, all the way from down the hall. My mother noticed and turned around, realizing that I had been eavesdropping the entire time. She immediately shut the door, the sliver of sight into their room, closed.

Instinctively, I pulled back into the room and shut my own door, slamming my back against it.

I took a deep breath, trying to contain my emotions.

If they knocked on the door, would I tell them I didn't hear anything or would I be honest? If I wasn't honest, they wouldn't trust me, and if I was, they would have to sit me down and have a long talk with me about my dad's sickness. That would be less than accustomed for. When my dad was first diagnosed, I made us all promise we wouldn't let it affect our lives. We would live exactly how we did before, and even though we would be caring for him 24/7, we would pretend the sickness never existed.

I couldn't stand the idea of my family falling apart, so I painted over it with an image of a _perfect_ family. As I've made it clear before, I never liked being the perfect family, which was what people assumed when my parents' first adopted Cal, but if it was going to help me feel more at peace with my father's condition, I'm going to have to fake it 'til I make it.

I just didn't want to face the fact that I could lose my father.

_I just need to distract myself from the thought. Look around, Sky, what makes you happy?_

I examined my room. A perfect display of the aspects of my mind and imagination in one place. It was as colorful and as random and as heavily decorated as it was four years ago, if not more.

I walked over to my bed and flopped down on top of it, my back to the mattress, staring up at the ceiling. I had grown so attached to the cracks in the ceiling of the former apartment, that it felt almost weird to see what was regularly on my own ceiling. There were even more posters and images of things‚Äîmy idols, my favorite pieces of art, my favorite movies and TV shows, my favorite bands and singers‚Äîplastered on my ceiling along with the glow-in-the-dark stars and planet stickers. It would be there every time I went to sleep so I would feel comfortable throughout the night, and it would be there every time I woke up in order to motivate me for the day.

And since that was Charlie's job when I was away at home, of course, there was a picture of him on my ceiling as well.

He knows about it. I'm not an obsessed psycho.

That was when I heard the sound of knocking on my door.

_It's them._

_What do I say?_

_Do I lie or tell the truth?_

I'll know what to do when I see them. _Just open the door, Sky._

I got up from the bed and, as expected, I opened the door.

But, what I didn't expect was that it wasn't my parents who knocked.  
  
  

"Hi, Cal," I greeted, looking down at the calico kitten who stood in my doorway, looking up at me with panic in his eyes. His hands were shaking, held together anxiously, his fingers jittering around and contorting in numerous ways.

He had also heard them arguing.

"C'mon, it's okay," I sighed and reached my hand for his shoulder, taking him inside, closing the door.

He's thirteen now.  

He had grown so much since the last time I saw him. He's almost as tall as me. He's probably going to be the only one in this family that will grow taller than 5'6 when he gets older. His voice has also gotten somewhat deeper. But, he still acts the same as he did before, the same lovable personality, just with a few more years of experience under his belt. He was wearing a white tank top and black shorts, his usual bedtime attire. He's grown out of pajamas. He hates them because he thinks they're childish, which is ironic because I still wear them. I'm wearing them now. I guess we were both prepared to go to sleep, that is, until we had heard the parental bickering.

I sat on the ledge of the bed, patting a spot to the right of me for him to sit. He took it, willingly.

"They're so loud," He mumbled, tugging the fur on the back of his head.

"They tried to keep their voices down, Cal, it's not on purpose," I assured him, covering my paws over his right ear, pressing his left ear into my side gently. I rested my chin on the top of his head.

We sat there for a little while, exchanging sympathy for one another. Cal held on tight to my arms, embracing the protection.

"Can I talk to you about something, Sky?" He asked, looking up at me.

"Of course, bud," I responded, letting go of him and lying back down on the bed, facing the ceiling once more. Cal did the same, lying next to me.

"Um... Promise me you won't tell mom and dad, alright?"

"I promise, Cal."

"Okay..." Cal took a deep breath, gaining confidence in me. Whatever he was about to tell me must be serious. "So, uh, question. When did you know you were gay?"

"That's a tough one," I chuckled, placing my paws on my stomach. I began to think back to when I realized my sexual orientation. "Well, it's difficult, because I never really... you know... addressed... my sexuality. I only ever assumed I was gay when I fell in love with Charlie. When I came out to him, I only said that I _thought_ I was gay. When I came out to mom and dad, I never said I was gay, I just said that I fell in love with a boy."

"Why?"

It really was a tough question. I was starting to gloss over things I never really put into focus.

"Well..." I released another sigh of frustration, laughing as I brushed my paw through the fur on my head awkwardly. "Cal, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you, but sexuality is weird. I never really understood it, and I still don't, to this day. I never solidified the fact that I was gay, I never announced that I was gay, I only dated Charlie because I fell in love with him."

"So, what are you?"

"I don't know, Cal."

"Haven't you always felt this way, though?"

"I've been... confused... for most of my life. In high school, I saw guys with their girlfriends, kissing, touching each other... Just, being a happy couple, you know? And I always longed for it, but I... I never understood whether it was because I was in love with the man, or... I wanted to be the girl."

"Does that make you trans?"

_..._

_Does it?_

"I really don't know, Cal. That's my honest answer. I really don't know."

Cal sighed and kept staring at the ceiling.

"Why do you ask?" I spoke up, wondering why he even brought it up in the first place.

"There's this boy in my grade... He's my best friend..." I heard Cal begin to confess. I suddenly felt my gut sink with shock and... _almost a little bit of exhilaration?_ "I don't... I don't know if I like him or not."

"Well... How do you feel about him?"

"I see him only as a friend, but, when we talk and when we joke, it reminds me of you and Charlie. I thought we acted similarly to the way you two did. Does that make me gay?"

_Oh, no..._

"Oh, Cal..." I sat up, causing him to do so, too. We both sat with our legs crossed, facing each other in the bed. "This may sound strange, and I could be wrong, and I don't want to offend you, but... it sounds almost like Charlie and I may have had an impact on you. That's only my guess, and of course, if you truly believe you have feelings for this boy, I support you fully, of course, but... I'm just worried that Charlie and I gave you false influence. Again, if I'm wrong and you really think that you might be gay, I will always be here for you and I will always love you and accept you for who you are, Cal. I just really hope a friendship isn't destroyed and it's my fault."

"Okay..." Cal hesitated, nodding his head. "So, what do I do to understand if I have feelings for him?"

"What's his name?"

"Koda."

"My advice for you is to just... wait. That's all you have to do. Wait for a little and try to figure out whether you like him romantically or just as a friend. All you have to do is wait and see, because it takes time to understand sexuality, Cal. It takes so much time."

I laughed as I spoke that last sentence, thinking back to personal experience. Cal laughed along with me, before the laughter slowly went away and he went back to staring at the floor.

"Look," I appointed, placing my hand under his chin and tilting his head up to mine. "You're young. We all are. And some people will tell you that you're just being a stupid teenager and that it's all just a phase. But, what's best is that you listen to your own heart. You do what feels right and what's good for you. It may sound scary, handling all your problems on your own, but if I'm being honest, you can handle them _ten times better_ than anyone else can. You are your own person, and you have the duty of finding out who you are. Don't let anybody else get in the way."

Cal looked into my eyes, trying to fight off a smile that was creeping onto his face.

"C'mon, smile!" I joked, pushing it out of him, tickling him. "Smiiiiiillle!"

"No!" Calico laughed, jostling around as I scratched my paws over his belly, where he was the most ticklish.

"I love you, okay?" I told him after I stopped tickling him, holding him by the shoulders.

"Whatever, Clouds," He rolled his eyes, backing away from me and jumping off the bed, heading for the door.

"Are you kidding me?" I scoffed, sitting in the bed, putting my arms up in disappointment.

"Ugh, fine," Cal rolled his eyes, climbing back onto the bed and giving me a hug. "I love you, too."

"That's for damn sure."

"You said a bad word."

"I'll say more if you don't get the heck outta my room!" I jeered, grabbing my giant donut pillow and holding it up, ready to toss it at him.

Cal screamed and raced for the door, opening it, closing it. And just like that, he was gone.

I sighed, shaking my head and rolling my eyes as I giggled quietly.

One thing that Cal had said was stuck in my mind, somehow.

_My sexuality..._

_What if I was transgender..?_

_I mean, the question has always been in the back of my mind... I've always thought about it... Considered it, even._

_The thought has stuck with me for years, long before I even met Charlie._

_When I saw myself with him, I never paid attention to the fact that we were both males or that I, myself, was a boy. I don't think I ever felt like a boy._

_I just felt like I existed. As Skyler._

_My gender didn't make me who I was._

_But, now that I'm an adult..._

_I... I'd rather not think of it right now..._

I laid back down on my mattress, my head hitting the decorative pillows, ready to finally fall asleep. I reached across the bed, flicking off the lamp that illuminated my room. I grabbed my fluffy, comfy blanket covers and tossed them over me, melting into the warmth they gave off. I took one last look at the ceiling, searching for the photos that always gave me a peaceful enough mindset to rest undoubtedly.

I saw pictures of Cal. I saw pictures of my mother. I saw pictures of my father.

And finally, I saw pictures of‚Äî

_DING DONG!_

The doorbell had rung.

_Ugh, what now?_

I sat up straight in bed, flicking the lamp back on, and emerging from the blankets. I opened the door, walking down the hallway, which led to the living room, which led to the front door. I saw my mom coming from her and my dad's room, dressed in a nightgown. I got to see her in full this time.

"Who's at the door?" She asked once she had set her sights on me.

"I dunno, I'm gonna check," I shrugged, walking into the living room. I made my way to the front door.

"It's probably a prank by some dumb kids, no one would be here at, like, eleven at night," My mother told me, standing in the doorway between the hallway and the living room.

"Watch, there's gonna be no one there," I snickered, opening the front door as I faced her.

I turned my head, my eyes landing on the chest of a white-furred husky. I inched my vision up a bit, recognizing that sweetly familiar face. I felt my body stiffen as my eyes and mouth widened.

"CHARLIE!" I screeched, stumbling back at the sight of him.

He stood in the doorway, smiling wide. He unfolded his arms, welcoming me into them.

"OH MY GOD!" I yelled again as I jumped onto him, wrapping my arms around his shoulders, kicking my feet hastily as he lifted me up into the air. I could hear him laugh as he fastened his arms onto my waist like a seatbelt.

"Hi, cupcake," He whispered into my ear as he put me down. He watched as I physically freaked out in front of him, shaking my paws in the air, stomping my feet rapidly to the floor. He patted my head as if he were trying to cool down an overheating machine.

"You're here, oh my god, you're here?!" It went from an exclamation to a question. I felt myself get a little loopy from all the excitement disrupting my sleepy disposition.

"Fan the boy, he's losing his mind," My mother teased, walking up to us, fanning her paw in my face jokingly.

"Hi, Olympia," Charlie greeted, leaning down to hug my mom.

"How are you, Charlie?" She smiled wide as she patted Charlie's back while hugging him.

"I'm doing fine, but I hate to ask," Charlie brought up, breaking the hug apart, looking at the two of us. "Can I stay here for a few days? I only need a week at the least, it's all the time I have and I can't really stay anywhere else. I'm terribly sorry for disturbing any plans or events that you may have scheduled‚Äî"

"Oh, stop that!" My mom chimed, playfully slapping Charlie on his shoulder. "You know that you are always welcome here, no matter what!"

"Thank you, Olympia," Charlie sighed in relief, holding his paws together in gratitude. It seemed like he was nervous to ask her that question. He never wanted to disappoint my parents.

"No need," My mom scoffed, shaking her head. She turned her back to us as she headed back to her room. "Just don't have sex in my house."

"MOM!" I yelped, blushing profusely. I slammed my paws to my face, covering it in embarrassment.

"I'm pretty confident we won't!" Charlie reassured.

My mom gave him a thumbs-up behind her back as she left the living room.

I stood there, trying to contain my excitement. Charlie looked at me, noticing that I was slightly bouncing up and down on my heels. I smiled at him, showing off almost every tooth in my mouth.

"You okay?" He teased as well, chuckling softly.

"Just... surprised you're here."

Charlie came close to me, wrapping his arms around me, squeezing my body tightly. He kissed my forehead, which made me even more excited. I began to giggle uncontrollably.

"Pipe your cute ass down, Sky," Charlie smirked, smacking my nose with his paw lightly.

\~~~

I helped Charlie take out some of the luggage from the Uber he came in, unloading only the things he needed for the week, such as his computer, clothes, and work equipment. As we filed them into my room, where he would be spending the nights, he told me about the job offer he got with Deno Yuvi, the film director, and how excited he was about it. The job was in LA, so, if there was any chance of convincing Charlie not to go, it was long gone now. He took the job, thankfully. I voiced my opinion about how I was also excited for him. I really was.

Once all the necessary stuff was moved and the Uber was off, Charlie and I got ready for bed.

"What happened to staying at your dad's place?" I asked, sitting on the bed as Charlie undressed. I sat with my arms‚Äîputting pressure on the mattress underneath me to hold my body up‚Äîand legs out, rubbing my right foot against my left leg.

"I... couldn't handle it, so... I sort of... left?" Charlie slurred, crossing his arms over his waist and pulling his t-shirt off of his torso cleanly.

"Did you guys fight again?"

"Yeah... I don't even need to explain it, it went exactly how our other fights have gone. It gets pretty repetitive." Charlie unzipped his fly and pulled off his jeans. He then climbed onto the bed, crawling over me with a grin on his face.

"But this never does," I spoke under my breath as Charlie leaned in, connecting his muzzle to mine. He began to make out with me strongly, pulling the blankets over the two of us.

He pressed his body against mine, pushing me deeper into the bed. I felt fully submerged, under his body, and in the bed; as if no part of my own fur and skin touched the air around us. I always loved that feeling, being under Charlie's dominance.

He caressed my face with his paws, touching my cheeks, fondling with my whiskers, stroking my neck. We've gotten more and more comfortable with each other over the years. So comfortable, in fact, that I began to grow more aroused as he touched me. The feeling of arousal flew through my body, but... it didn't reach down to a certain area. I felt I should be concerned about it, but Charlie's tongue exploring my mouth was distracting me. He was so dextrous with his moves. He could make any girl happy.

"How would your dad feel about this?" I asked softly as he kissed my neck.

"I'd rather not think of him at this moment."

"He still knows we're dating, right? You told him?"

"Sky..."

"Charlie."

Charlie stopped working his mouth and turned his attention back to me.

"Don't you think he's trying?"

"I don't want to think of him right now."

"I'm just saying, you never really gave him a chance, all you've done is fought him."

"Sky, I gave him unlimited chances. Now I'm standing my ground. It's about time he learned his lesson and understand what his actions can do to a person. I can't keep going back to him, that makes me weak‚Äî"

"Okay, okay. I get it," I interrupted. I've heard this lecture a million times before.

"What?"

"I'd, just, rather not fight right now."

"We're not fighting."

"We're arguing."

"Sky, everyone argues." Charlie caressed my head, scratching it ever so softly. "It's okay."

"I don't want to."

"Oh, Sky..." Charlie looked at me apologetically, a small smile on his face. It was as if he pitied me. "You don't have to worry. Whatever we say, it won't hurt. It never will."

"Even if it's a really bad argument?"

"How many fights have we had?"

"Plenty."

"And how many times have we reconciled?"

"Plenty..."

"Do we love each other any less?"

"Of course not..."

"None of those fights have hurt us, Sky. It'll be okay. You're the most important person in my life and I would never let you go. No matter what we say to each other."

The tips of my mouth curled up as well. Not a full smile, but one small enough to let Charlie know that what he was saying was making me feel better.

"My mom and dad, they almost never fight, you know."

"Really?"

"Even when they do, they like to say that they're 'fighting with love'. Never with hatred."

"That was my parents at one point."

"I'm sorry, Charlie."

"I'm sorry, too, Sky."

We went back to kissing.

Anything that Charlie could say to me would make me feel so much better. Whether I'm sad, angry, confused, hurt, anything Charlie could say would fix so much. That's why I love him. That's why I _fell_ in love with him, without even knowing anything about my own sexuality or what I liked.

He made me feel good.

And that was all.

I sunk back into the moment, returning every kiss that Charlie had planted on my mouth. We kissed for what felt like hours, until we were both too tired to continue. We decided we were exhausted enough to sleep.

"Goodnight, Sky," Charlie whispered into my ear as he spooned me in the bed.

"Goodnight, Charlie," I whispered back as he kissed the side of my head.

Finally, after a long day, I slowly drifted back to sleep.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

"GOODNIGHT, GAYS!!" I heard Calico shout as he opened my bedroom door, slamming it after he finished his sentence.

"CALICO!!" Both Charlie and I screamed in unison.

# 5. TEMPORARY OR FINAL?

\~~~

## Charlie

Almost every morning, when I wake up to Sky sleeping, usually, his head is rested on my chest and he is lying on top of my body, as he had done the whole night through. It's a good feeling to wake up to. The thought that he's all mine. The feeling of my larger, stronger build submerging his smaller, more fragile frame. The sensation of my duty as his protector, his knight in shining armor.

But, when the roles are switched, it's an even nicer feeling.

I woke up that morning, my head snuggled deeply into Skyler's chest. It generates the idea that I am loved in my own right. That these feelings I have for him are not one-sided. I feel Sky's arms around me, his paws resting lightly on my back. We're so close to one another. Our bodies fit perfectly together. Like two pieces of a puzzle. It's satisfying and relaxing and, as I had said before, a pleasure to wake up to.

It's also extremely cute when he's still asleep. I don't know how many times I've said that, but I honestly can't get enough of him.

I opened my eyes, my right cheek pushed up against the cloth fabric of his pajamas. It felt so nice just to be there, in his arms. My own home away from home. I picked my head up and placed my chin on his chest instead, staring intently at my sleeping kitten. His head was slightly tilted to the right, his eyes were closed, and his breathing, or should I say _purring_, was soft and hallucinating. The way the air, flowing out through the small nostrils of his pink button nose, ruffled his whiskers every time he exhaled made me want to giggle aloud, but I kept it in for his sake.

_What was going on in that wondrous brain of his?_

_Was he dreaming? If so, what about?_

_I loved every second of this... I never wanted it to end. I could watch him sleep for hours._

This beautiful moment only made me sadder. I realized what I would be missing out on, moving to LA without my Skyler. I hadn't just realized it, the fear had always been in the back of my mind for the past few months, but it came back to hurt me at different intervals each day.

In six days' time, I would be leaving for Cali.

Sky would be staying here.  
  
  

_It sucks._

_Because I almost... I feel like..._

_I wouldn't mind... if I could wake up to him... like this... every day... for the rest of my life._

_I really wouldn't mind._

_And that's why it sucks._  
  
  

My eyes perked up in reaction to Skyler rolling his head to the left with a slight moan. Any small action from him can bring me back to reality whenever I'm deep in thought, even if it's just an unconscious head roll. I was in my own mind. Sky stabilizes me.

He began to squint a little as he moaned a little more, slowly bringing himself to wakefulness.

"Are you awake?" I asked softly, keeping my voice down.

"I dunno..." I heard him mumble, listlessly, through his lips that didn't want to open.

I chuckled lightly, leaning in towards his left ear and slightly opening my jaw. I teasingly sunk the tips of my front teeth into his ear lobe, nibbling at it. Sky began to moan in frustration a little more. I bit down a tiny bit harder. I could feel Sky begin to feebly smack my shoulder.

"What are you doing?" He slurred with a laugh, still half-asleep.

"Biting your ear," I mumbled through my closed jaw as I pressed my molars down even harder.

"Charlie... OW!" Sky yelped, kicking his feet up and locking them around my waist as he jostled to push me away. He was most definitely awake now.

"This husky is starving and he's gonna devour you!" I pretended to growl with a low, monstrous voice, shoving my muzzle into the side of his face. Sky kept laughing and slapping me as I pretended to bite his neck.

"You're insane!" Sky murmured breathlessly in-between fits of laughter.

I pulled the blankets off of us and sat up in the bed, dismounting his body. He curled into a ball, his legs and arms shriveling in, once exposed from the covers. His pajamas were plaid patterned and colored dark blue and purple. He never liked to show any of his fur, and since the bottoms of his PJs were shorts, he wore these really tall socks that almost reached his thighs. I didn't know how this cat could wear pajamas and socks, over all that fur, to sleep on a summer night, but he was always cold in the night and in the morning. He whimpered subtly as he hid his face behind his arms.

I grabbed the ankles of his feet and yanked his body forward in the bed. He screamed, his limbs unraveling, as I jumped back onto him, landing my face into his stomach. I pretended to gobble him up from his abdomen like a zombie feasting on flesh. Sky giggled uncontrollably, the feeling too ticklish, holding his arms up around his head. I tossed and turned my muzzle around against his fur in multiple ways, opening and closing my jaw repeatedly, placing my paws on the sides of his torso, gripping him under his armpits.

"Stop, Charlie!" Sky kept laughing and cringing at my ridiculousness. "My parents are gonna hear us!"

"Good, and they better come quick, because if they don't, all they'll find left of your remains is a bare skeleton."

"You're so gross."

I pressed my face up against his cheek. "And you're so delicious," I whispered, my mouth still touching his fur. Before Sky could return with a comeback, I planted my lips on his, immediately shoving my tongue into his mouth.

Sky had another tiny spasm and pushed me away again with a groan.

"Hey, no tongues in the morning! I haven't brushed my teeth yet!" He whined, wiping his mouth.

"Does it look like I care?"

"It amazes me how immature you are for your age," Sky bantered sarcastically, pushing the fur back behind my ears.

"And it amazes me how terrible your bedhead is," I bantered back, pressing down the areas of stuck-up fur on the back of his head. Sky lost his smile and shot a death glare at me. "Seriously, every morning for the past four years, your fur is always a fucking mess. How is that even possible?"

"This is why I shower every morning," Sky deadpanned, still staring monotonously at me.

"You use up all the hot water, babe. You're a thief of warmth."

"Ew, don't call me 'babe', like, ever."

"Okay, babe."

"STOP IT."

\~~~

I showered first that morning so Sky could get a taste of his own medicine. After changing into a fresh pair of clothes from my luggage, I ate breakfast with Sky's parents and Calico while Skyler took his own shower. I spent the rest of that morning eating Olympia's famous pancakes and drinking Thompson's signature hot chocolate (Yes, for breakfast), and chatting with Calico about how seventh grade has been treating him. He's strongly opinionated about many things and doesn't hold back when addressing personal issues. The way he spoke out about his school's problems reminded me of how a politician would speak out about their country. He's definitely going places, alright.

Olympia then had to run off to work as she was on the clock, and since Thompson was resting in the bedroom, I was alone with you-know-who. Calico had asked if me and Sky had sex yet. I stared him down until he went quiet.

Sky then emerged from his room, showing off his outfit for the day. He was wearing light blue, faded, ripped skinny jeans for his bottom half and a pastel-rainbow-striped, short sleeve tee for his torso. On his feet, he wore those same thigh-high socks and yellow checkered Vans. He had his iconic bronze skeleton key, hanging from a chain around his neck, along with a few other rose gold necklaces that were small and ornamental. Silver earrings that represented pointy crosses hung from his ears. To top it all off, he wore a faded pink beanie with a sunflower stitched onto the front flap, and two slots for his ears to poke out.

"Damn, Sky," I gawked, sitting back in my chair.

"Is it too much?" Sky worried, looking down at his body. I sat up from my chair and walked over to him. "The shirt feels a little... too tight."

"I love it," I complimented with a soft voice to soothe his nerves. I placed my paws on his cheeks and kissed his forehead. "You can always choose what you want to wear, but personally, I love the way you express yourself, Sky."

"I just feel like this shirt makes me look... too skinny for a boy."

"It also blatantly screams, 'I'm gay'," Calico mocked from the dining table. We both rolled our eyes, not even bothering to reprimand him. He just kept snickering through bites of fluffy pancake.

"I'm gonna change into something... less... revealing," Sky hesitated, running back into his room. I laughed at the fact that he had depicted that shirt as 'revealing'.

"You do you," I called from the hallway as he closed the door. I turned to face Cal, who was still cutting his pancakes into slices, drizzled with maple syrup and butter.

"He's something, isn't he?" Cal spoke. "I think we're going into town later today. Like, afternoon-ish."

"We are?"

"Yeah, there's a new arcade on Tomasetti Street. Sky wanted to surprise you, but I could care less."

"You really look after your older brother, don't you?"

"I'm sorry, I thought that was supposed to be your job."

I bit my lower lip. A few seconds of silence passed.

"I think you're one of the coolest thirteen-year-olds I know."

"That's depressing."

"Shut up."

\~~~

Sky had, instead, worn a designer button-down that was white, baggy, and displayed a continuous pattern of black lines that traced into shapes that resembled abstract faces. Over time, he's been collecting more and more designer and fashionable clothing to wear. He almost looked like he could be a model or some type of runway poster boy.

That afternoon, we had all freshened up and had gotten ready to go outside for the rest of the day. Cal and I put on an act and pretended as if I didn't know Skyler's surprise.

We departed from the house, heading into town. The summer atmosphere was hot, sunny, and liberating. I had put sunglasses on. Cal rode on his own bike while I sat behind Sky on his double-seater. I was honestly frightened out of my mind, worried that I was going to fall off the bike and hit the concrete, but my grip around Sky's waist never faltered. As the wind blew through the sweaty patches of fur on my body, I had realized how nice of a feeling it was. Windy, hot, summer days was probably my favorite weather. Riding on bikes in the sun... I couldn't help but feel free.

It was at that moment when it finally came to me.

_This is what being an adult should feel like._

_Not what I was feeling before at my father's place._

_This is it._

_This is the life._  
  
  

_With Skyler. The love of my life._  
  
  

And, as always, it made me sadder knowing that I would have to leave.  
  
  

We rode into town, which was not too far from Sky's suburban and secluded home. We parked on the sidewalk and chained our bikes to a bike rack. I stopped and looked around, admiring the scenery. It was a small, yet, hopeful community. There were tiny, old-school stores on every block, including a creamery, a bed and breakfast, an antique shop, a diner, a deli, a bakery, a coffee shop, a danish pastry cafe, and on and on. It felt like a village lost in time. For example, there was one vintage candy store down the road that only sold treats from the 90s and older. I'd been here only a few times, but each time I came, I had the time of my life. It was a lovely town and a lovely neighborhood. A quiet, peaceful place to live and raise a family. Everyone here knew everyone, even if you were new to town. The people here welcomed you with open arms. I guess it's clear now where Sky and his parents get the trait from. They grew up in a good neighborhood.

When Sky had directed us to the new arcade, I pretended to act surprised. Safe to say, the act failed. Sky saw straight through it and put the pieces together, becoming instantly peeved at both me and Calico. We followed as Sky stormed into the arcade. Thankfully, it was cute-anger and not scary-anger.

We walked past glowing machines with multi-colored lights and bizarre sound effects. There were kids, teens, and adults alike, flooding the arcade, dropping coins into slots, pressing buttons, toggling joysticks. We made our way up to a machine that exchanged money for tokens. Sky pulled out his wallet from his handbag and slipped a few bills into the machine, which sucked them up immediately. I watched as he tapped icons on the screen, getting us our tokens to play the arcade games.

Cal tugged on Sky's shirt anxiously, causing Sky to immediately reach into his handbag and pull out his headphones. He shortened the sides so they would fit Cal's head and leaned down, placing the muffs over Cal's ears.

"What song do you want?" Sky asked him.

"Just put on your playlist," Cal responded.

Sky nodded and pulled out his phone, doing just that. He then leaned back up and went back to tapping the screen of the machine, which dropped a good portion of fake coins into a container for us to obtain. Sky opened the flap and reached in, scooping up the shiny gold tokens and apportioning them off so we all got an equal sum.

It started with one of those Jurassic Park video games where you sat inside a booth that had fake plastic guns, attached to the counter that stood in front of a large screen displaying the game. Since there were only two players at a time, Sky and Cal played the first round. I stood on the outside of the booth, watching them play. They inserted the tokens and chose their characters and the map they would explore. They were then tossed right in. They both pressed down on the buttons of the fake guns and began to shoot the various dinosaurs that came their way. Cal seemed to be on target while Sky was failing drastically. Once Sky had lost enough health and had died, him and I swapped out. I placed my coins into the slot and revived his character, continuing the game alongside Cal, who had, surprisingly, not lost any health. Once I had died, Sky and I swapped again and he revived his player with his own coins.

Once the first round was over, we didn't continue, fearful that we were wasting tokens. Cal had the most points, of course, so he got to enter his name onto the leaderboard. It was only a three-letter nickname, so Cal had written... well... 'CAL'. Sky began to laugh and had joked that both he and Calico could put their three-letter nicknames in, but mine would just be 'CHA'.

We then split off, Sky attending Cal at all times while I went on my own. I lost a few of my tokens to a couple of claw games, played a few rounds of skeeball, and attempted one of those wheel-of-fortune games. I even took on the challenge of playing that machine game where you had to press the buzzer once the lightbulb in front of it had lit up. Of course, I wasn't successful, but it was worth the try. It was probably rigged, either way.

Sky, Cal, and I reunited with a few games of air hockey. The sound of the disc sliding clean into the goal was even more satisfying than Skyler's rage every time I scored a point. I've become a master at air hockey and it was one of my favorite arcade games. We then migrated to one of those basketball games where you and another player had to score as many hoops as possible in a given timeframe. We pressed the option for three players so we could all go against each other. On my turn, I used the knowledge that Jonathan had given me in high school and made twenty-one hoops. Cal had made fifteen on his turn. Sky made two. Both Cal and I had a grand time bullying him about it, to which he dismissed with crossed arms and an eye roll.

Once all the tokens were used up, we put together the tickets we had each individually collected and decided to combine them for one big prize at the ticket counter that we all could share. After careful consideration, we decided on the mini-ukulele. It was basically a toy and sounded like shit, but we didn't care.

Hours after first getting there, we left the arcade, full of laughter and joy. We then made our way, down the semi-crowded sidewalk, to the creamery as our last stop for the day. The sun was beginning to set and we needed to get back home.

As usual, we inhaled the sweet smell of sugary delight as we entered the ice cream store. It was air-conditioned and gave off that sense of relief when you're exhausted or tired. Cal stared through the glass, entranced by all the different flavors and patterns. I had asked for cookies and cream and Sky had ordered cotton candy. The employee scooped up the ice cream and carefully placed it into a waffle cone, one for me and one for Sky. Cal was still having trouble deciding which flavor. He had asked for a million free samples, wanting his choice to be perfectly thought out. He finally settled on birthday cake. Sky and I both thought that it would taste awful, but Cal engorged himself.

We all walked home together, licking our frozen treats, the sun just barely peeking among the horizon. We could see other families and residents of the neighborhood making their way home on the sidewalk. As we passed by, some of them had waved at Sky since they had known him. As I said, everyone here knows everyone. Some of them, who I recognized from past visits, even waved at me.

Cal began to walk ahead of us, still wearing his headphones, licking his ice cream in a repeated, patterned motion. Sky and I strolled, hand-in-hand, monitoring him from behind. We both giggled softly at his small actions, carrying his toy ukulele by the fretboard, as we licked our own ice cream away. We both bantered back and forth with one another. I joked that I could eat ice cream with my teeth, to which Sky called my bluff. Once I had done it, the cold treat almost froze my jaw, transforming my teeth into ice cubes. I groaned from the brain freeze as Sky winced and patted my back.

I loved moments like these.

Moments with Skyler.

I'm so grateful to be sharing these soon-to-be priceless memories with him. I'm one of the luckiest huskies on earth, ending up with a boyfriend like him. He's so sweet, so kind, so adorable... He owns my heart.

It always makes me so happy to know that I have him and that he's all mine.  
  
  

_But, he won't be all mine if we'll be apart..._

_I... I don't think I can handle a long-distance relationship..._

_Because... I'll always long for the feeling of him... his touch..._

_Waking up to him every morning..._

_Some people might call me selfish. Some people will tell me that I should be grateful that I even have Skyler at all..._

_But..._

_He's a package deal._

_Having Skyler means having moments like these._

_Holding hands. Eating ice cream. Bike rides. Arcade games. Calico. Joking. Laughing._

_Waking up to him..._  
  
  

_I want to wake up to him every morning._  
  
  

_But, the question is, is it temporary or final? The choice has always been up to circumstance, but maybe, just maybe, Sky and I can choose for ourselves. Just for once._  
  
  
  
  
  

_There's a question I've been meaning to ask him..._  
  
  

_I've thought about it for a while now, but I've always pushed it down because I know how Sky would react._  
  
  

_But, it's now or never._  
  
  

I turned my head to look down at Sky, who was still monitoring Cal as he walked ahead.  
  
  

Now's my chance.

_You got this, Charlie._  
  
  

"Sky?" I squeezed his paw, the gesture notifying him that what I was about to say was serious.

"What's up?" He responded, looking up at me with his sparkly pink eyes.

I stopped in the sidewalk, turning my body to face him. Sky did the same, suddenly concerned.

"Can I talk to you about something?"

"Of course."

I took a deep breath and placed my right, non-ice-cream-occupied, paw on his shoulder, rubbing it comfortingly. Sky looked into my eyes with confusion, an obvious sense of dread overcoming him. He seemed worried; frightened almost.

_I mean, when someone sits you down and says, 'we need to talk', you'd be frightened too, right?_

"Look, I know that you've told me over and over about this..." I began, closing my eyes and speaking from the heart. "I know you've warned me a million times... And that you've made it clear that this is what you want... But, I just... I love you, Sky. More than anything in the world, and I don't want this to be hard for either of us. And you said it yourself, long-distance relationships never work... The thing is, I don't ever want to apart from you, because when I am, I feel like I'm missing a significant part of myself. A significant part of my heart. I just want to make things easier... for us..."  
  
  

"Are you breaking up with me?"

I opened my eyes and immediately shot my head up to Skyler, who was staring at the concrete, somnolently.

"What?" I stuttered, not able to comprehend that he would even think that. "N-No, Sky! Of course, not!" I chuckled and stepped closer to the anxious cat, trying to calm his nerves. He looked back up at me, caught off guard, hope building once again. "I wouldn't do that. Not now, not ever. Why did you think...?"

"I don't know, just, with everything happening... Us both, we're... We're from different worlds, Charlie." Sky bit his lip apologetically, his eyes jerking back and forth, tears forming. "We want different things. Different futures. Different lives. I thought that maybe..."

"Skyler, no, I don't care about that," I spoke, stepping even closer and touching his neck with my right paw, caressing his cheek with my thumb. I didn't even care that the ice cream was beginning to melt in my other hand. "What I care about is you. Us. Our relationship surviving."

"What did you want to talk to me about, then?"

I sighed and took one last glance at his beautiful, sunset pink eyes, feeling the warmth and friendliness of his presence as a whole.

"Sky, before I begin, please promise me that you won't dismiss it. Promise me that... you'll think about it, at least? It's your choice, of course, but all I'm asking is that you... consider it. I just want you to listen and not fight me, okay? Do you promise, Sky?"

"I promise, Charlie."  
  
  

"I want you to move in with me, Skyler."

# 6. GO!

\~~~

## Skyler

The next six days, after Charlie dropped his immense ask, consisted of the following: one, me looking for job options, two, Charlie waiting on a confirmed date for when filming began, three, Calico being a nuisance, four, talking to Mom and Dad about me and Charlie's relationship and life in general, five, me taking care of my father whenever he needed it, and last but not least, six, considering Charlie's immense ask.

The week was supposed to be our last period of freedom before the burdens and weight of adulthood struck us like a storm in a once smooth-sailing ocean. But, instead, I spent it in self-strife, waiting anxiously in anticipation as the week neared an end. When I would have to give Charlie my answer.

I wanted to be happy this week‚Äîmy, supposedly, last week with him. But, I ruined it with my neverending, self-contained, ongoing panic attack. Whenever I want to be free or feel unrestrained by the encumbrance of my own mind, that small panic attack haunts the corners of my head, teasing me maliciously. I never know when it's going to lash out. When it'll be unleashed. When I'll break down and drop ten layers deeper into a bottomless pit. Sometimes I'll feel like I'm floating and in a steady position, but then, suddenly, my mental health just goes lower, no matter how hard I try.

I spent my whole week with that on my mind, other than Charlie.  
  
  

Charlie and I were lying in my bed, staring up at the ceiling, no words being exchanged at all. It was Sunday. Charlie left for California in a few hours.

We were both putting it off. Neither of us wanted to talk about it.

I didn't want to give him my answer. It was an extremely difficult choice. I spent the whole week on a tightrope, leaning both ways, losing my balance constantly. I didn't know which direction to fall. I just kept standing on my toes, struggling to keep my footing. Either, stay home and care for your family, or move in with Charlie.

_Choose quick, or else the tightrope will snap and you won't be able to choose either. You'll just drop down ten more stories._

I turned my head to the right in the bed, looking at a bored Charlie, who was staring blankly into space. I wanted to ask if he was okay, or if I could do anything, but that would bring up the point of interest, and neither of us wanted to face it.

I wanted to say something. We were wasting time. Charlie was leaving soon and this was not how I wanted to spend our last moments.

Charlie suddenly took his phone out from his pocket, breaking out of his empty, half-alive state. I watched as he opened his messages app and scrolled through, searching for something.

"Anything yet?" I broke the silence, Charlie turning his head back at me.

"As of now, nothing from Amy," He said with a sigh. "But I do have several messages from Jonathan‚Äî"

"‚ÄîOh, is he okay?‚Äî"

"‚ÄîYeah, he's just sending me photos of his house. Five messages from Cassie‚Äî"

"‚ÄîOh, how is she?‚Äî"

"‚ÄîGood, um, two messages from Rue‚Äî"

"‚ÄîWait, how's Rue doing with her new job in Ohio?‚Äî"

"‚ÄîShe enjoys it, I heard she interviewed Zendaya last week, so, yeah, one message from Mastace‚Äî"

"‚ÄîOh, how is he and Briggan?‚Äî"

"‚ÄîBriggan's in the Armed Forces, Mastace is still in Bristol, so, they're doing fine, I hope... uh, and... fifteen messages... from daddy." Charlie slapped the phone down on his chest in annoyance.

"Maybe, you should respond?" I crossed my arms with the suggestion.

"I'm not really feeling up to it. I don't even know what to say."

"Hm."

I looked back up at the ceiling, not knowing what to say either. I had to continue the conversation in a better direction. I didn't want to bring up Charlie's proposal, and I definitely didn't want Charlie to go on another rampage about his feelings for his father, it wouldn't help him at all.

"It should be soon," Charlie nodded his head, changing the subject. "When filming starts, I mean. It's a short film and from what Amy first told me, production should only take a month."

"Wait, only a month?"

"Well, a month and a half at least."

"Will that keep you afloat?"

"What does that mean?"

"I mean, like, income-wise."

"Well, pretty much, yeah, it should help me out until my next job. I've already made a ton from my last film, so if I maintain steady spending, I'll survive."

"How much are they paying you again?"

"Enough to rent a house."

I suddenly got quiet. Charlie had somehow steered the conversation directly to what we both were trying to avoid, yet, I didn't know if it was on purpose or not.

I sighed deeply and rubbed my eyes with the tips of my fingers in anguish. That's when I felt Charlie shift in the bed, followed by the touch of his paw gently clasping around my small wrist. He slowly pulled my arm away from my face, causing me to open my eyes and look at him. He stared down at me, his gaze sending a telepathic message along the lines of, 'we have to talk'.

"We have to talk, Sky," Charlie whispered, placing his opposing paw on my waist, rubbing it. I closed my eyes and squinted them in reaction. "I need an answer. It's now or never."

I felt my eyebrows furrow as I grew more and more anxious. Charlie detected the change in my expression, knowing exactly what my answer was going to be.

"Charlie..." I took a shaky deep breath, placing my paw on his shoulder with sympathy. "I want to. I really want to." The way his face lit up for a small moment almost broke my heart. I didn't want to have to tell him this.

"But, I can't. I can't go."

Charlie closed his eyes and sunk his head down in defeat. I sat up in the bed, reaching his level, pushing my arms into the mattress to gain balance.

"Charlie, wait, before you say anything, please listen‚Äî"

"Sky, I know that you want to stay with your father and Cal‚Äî"

"They need me, Charlie."

"Do they?" Charlie looked back up at me with concern.

_I couldn't believe that he had just asked me that, but I didn't want to persecute him for it._

"Of course, they do!" I told him in a calm, yet administrative manner. "Calico needs someone to look after him‚Äî"  

"He's grown up, Sky, he can handle himself. He's a strong kid. I'd think you would know that by now."

"But, my dad, he's sick!"

"And he's in recovery. He's getting treatment. Plus, both of them have Olympia."

"I don't want my mom to handle all of this on her own!"

"She did for four years. While you were away."

"Charlie, you don't get it‚Äî"

"Sky, in my honest opinion... I feel like it's because you don't want to leave." My eyebrows tilted. I was almost stunned by his words. "But, you have to understand that... it's life. We move on. Birds leave the nest."

"Charlie, please, just listen for once!" I began to shout. Both he and I were taken aback by the volume of my voice. I lowered it in regret, looking at the floor, regaining my composure.

_He needed to understand how hard this was for me. He needed to know._

"Charlie... Can I tell you something?"

"Sure, Sky," Charlie agreed after long hesitation. It was about time I confessed my alibi.

"I remember that when you first met my mom and dad, you said they looked too young to be my parents, right?"

"Yeah, why‚Äî"

"Charlie..." I glanced to the side, my eyes beginning to well up with tears. "My parents had me when they were young."

Charlie immediately went quiet. He knew where this was going.

"Very young, in fact. They met in elementary school and dated from seventh grade up until twelfth. They were immature, they didn't know what they were doing," I recalled with a small laugh. "They were young, dumb teenagers in love. And who could blame them? Kids will be kids, you know? Who knows what'll happen to them, if they'll separate in a few years' time, or, if they'll grow old together and marry and have kids, eventually. That whole fantasy came crashing down when my father forgot to use a condom one night. My parents had me when they were seventeen. I don't really mind it, it doesn't bother me, but, yeah... I was a mistake. It is what it is."

Charlie hid his face awkwardly and in embarrassment. It may have been a case of TMI, but I needed to share it with him in order to justify my decision.

"And do you remember how I said my parents were religious?"

Charlie nodded his head unwillingly.

"Well, they got that from _their_ parents. _They_ were religious. When my mother had me, my grandparents were so outraged... that they threw my mom and my dad out on the street... with nothing but the clothes on their backs and a newborn baby in their arms." I sniffled, thinking about how hard it must've been on them. "They lived together in a car for months, caring for me. They worked their asses off trying to get me a good life. A better life than their own. And when I was five, this neighborhood took us in and helped us out. Some of the residents here pitched in and got us this house for us to live in for a few years. And when I was nine, my parents finally had steady jobs and had made enough money to purchase it in full, in order to pay back all the people who had helped us. That was the day I promised myself that, in the future, when I was an adult, I would care for them the same way they cared for me."

Charlie was sucking up all the information at once like a sponge. I didn't know how he would take it, but by the look on his face, he still seemed as persistent as he was earlier. Maybe even more.

"Sky, I understand," He responded, "I know how it feels to be burdened by a debt so large that you can't bear to carry it, but, you're missing the bigger picture. You haven't thought this through. You don't have a job yet. You don't have a way to provide for your family other than being of assistance. You're not situated enough. And that takes time, Sky. You can always fulfill this promise of yours, but the thing is, you're settling down far too quickly. You're 22, Sky. You're young. We're young. And you're moving into this like you're going to be here, caring for your family, for the rest of your life. That commitment takes time, okay? That's something you do in your, I don't know, forties or sixties! When they actually need your help! You're moving into it too quickly! You need to actually live your life before you devote it to someone else, alright?"

"Charlie, my parents were forced with the same decision I have to make when they were thrown out! They needed to decide whether to devote themselves to their own lives or me! And they chose me. And, now it's my turn. I don't care that I'm 22, they were younger than me when they had to deal with the burdens of adulthood."

"But they wanted a better life for you, Sky. You said that." Charlie put his paws on my shoulders. "You shouldn't have to deal with this at such a young age. This is not what they would've wanted for you. They devoted their lives to you, not because they knew you would someday pay them back, but because they knew you had a future. That's the debt you should be repaying. You need to live out your future, Sky, not waste it staying home. Move in with me, Sky."

"Charlie!"

"It won't feel right without you, Skyler. Think about me. I won't feel safe, alone. I won't have anywhere to go or anyone to go to. I won't feel right without you."

"Charlie, please, you're getting so much, don't you get it? You're getting so much, please don't waste it on me. You should be grateful. You have LA. You have a job. You have a career. A future. A lifelong passion! You're even buying yourself a home‚Äî!"

"Sky, you are my home!" Charlie yelled, interrupting me.

I fell quiet once again. What he had said silenced me brutally.

My heart was breaking even more. _I didn't want us to go through another fight. I didn't want this to be another fight. I pray to God that this won't be another fight._

"I can't go," I stated simply.

_Please, just understand my point of view, Charlie, and accept that as my answer. Please don't fight me on this. Please._

"There's this house..."

"Charlie."

"It's perfect for the two of us... I spent months researching houses, basing my findings on the mindset of both you and me. I looked for a house that would fit us both. And I finally found it, Sky."

"You're relying on me again! Charlie, this is your future, not mine! You can't base your life off of pleasing me, you have to focus on yourself once in a while‚Äî!"

"I can't, Sky. I can't not focus on you," Charlie was brought to tears as well. "You're one of the only things that stuck with me. You're the most important thing in my life. You're my number one priority, Skyler." He didn't know how else to hold me in this situation, so he just kept fumbling his paws over my shoulders with worry.

"Please, I don't want to fight," I sniffled, tears streaming down my face.

"We're not, Sky!"

"It feels like we are! I don't want to fight in our last moments!"  

"They don't have to be our last moments!"

"I can't move in with you!"

"You can't or you don't want to?"

"I want to, Charlie. I really do. But I can't. Will you please just accept that answer and accept that we both have different lives?"

"Remember the last time you chose what you thought was good for you over what you actually wanted? This is the same scenario, Skyler."

"And I'm older now, Charlie. Adulthood isn't what we want it to be. We've been taught that since day one. I've memorized it in my head. Have you?"

"I thought you promised we would never say goodbye."

"We're not."

"It feels like we are."

"We're not, Charlie."

"When's the next time we'll see each other, then?"

"I don't know."

"Do you come to me or do I come to you?"

"I don't know!"

"This is going to tear us apart, Sky."

"It already has."

"You're not breaking up with me, right?"

"I don't want to! So, I'm not going to!"

"Then where does that leave us?"

"I DON'T KNOW!"

That deadly silence returned.

It filled the room like toxic gas, the atmosphere growing as thick as cement.

Charlie appeared to be afraid of me, but I knew that there was no way he could ever be. His eyes darted from me to the floor as his expression dropped in disappointment. I bit my lip anxiously, tasting the salty tear as it dripped past my mouth, wishing that all our problems could just go away.

_I wish being an adult wasn't this hard..._

But then, out of nowhere, Charlie lunged forward and wrapped his arms around me, hugging me tightly. Of course, I hugged him back, though not knowing what the purpose was.

"What are you doing?" I asked softly with my broken voice.

"I'm stopping our last day together from becoming shit," He responded, smushing his muzzle into my shoulder. "I love you, Sky, and it's your life. You choose how you want to live it. I was selfish for trying to take control of you."

"You weren't, Charlie," I told him. "You just wanted the best for me. You always have."

Charlie pulled back and placed his paws on my cheeks, staring at me intently.

"I'm sorry," He apologized sincerely.

"I forgive you, Charlie," I grinned generously through my tears.

"You wanna, just... spend these last few hours just making out?" He snickered, the edges of his mouth curling up into a smile.

_How could I reject that face?_

"That sounds amazing."

We both immediately burst out with laughter, connecting our lips as we had wanted, wrapping our arms around each other. As we both kissed tenderly, I couldn't get the thought out of my mind.

_I wanted to take him up on his offer so bad. I really would have, too. It's what I would've wanted._

\~~~

I stood from the front doorway on the porch, watching as Charlie packed the Uber car that would take him back to the airport. He shut the trunk and turned, facing me.

We were separated by distance, but together in spirit.

_I only hoped that was how it would always be from now on._

I waved feebly.

He waved back.

He was all set and ready to head off to California. He had already said goodbye to Mom, Dad, and Calico. They all said they were going to miss him and to come back whenever. Yes, even Cal did.

I tried to push out a smile and cover my saddened emotions, but it just looked like I was going to cry again. Charlie could tell, of course. He always did.

He made his way back up the porch and approached me sentimentally. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded-up piece of paper, holding it up in front of his face.

"If you ever change your mind," He assured, inserting the paper into my pants pocket without any assistance from me. He then placed both of his paws on my shoulders once again, kissing the top of my head. "I'll see you soon, Whiskers," He said, touching his forehead to mine.

"I'm gonna call you nonstop, so you better have your phone on you at all times," I instructed, resulting in a laugh from him.

"Of course, sweet thing," He whispered, placing his paw underneath my chin and tilting my mouth up for him to plant another kiss on.

He did, but this time around, the kiss felt more bittersweet than passionate. Mostly because I knew that this was going to be the last one in a while. _I don't know how long I can go without Charlie's kisses. Their the nicest thing on the planet._

Charlie took a step backward and nodded, giving me the courage to believe that things would be okay.

"See you, Charlie," I spoke to him, though it felt more like I was saying it to myself.

Charlie smiled.

He left me on the porch.

He climbed into the Uber.

I waved one last time, not knowing if he saw through the window.

The Uber drove off.

It got smaller.

And smaller.

And then it was gone.  
  
  

Charlie was gone.

\~~~

I was curled up in a ball, lying in my bed; the safe haven that hid under the warm blankets. My headphones were over my head, feeding songs from my favorite bands into my ears, drowning out any sound that came from around me. I could feel tears stream down the side of my face and wet the pillowcase underneath my head.

I had been like this for a few hours now.

_I'll recover in the morning. It's okay. No need to be so upset, Skyler._

_You'll see him again. You will._

Then, from out of nowhere, the covers were lifted off of me. Along with that, two hands reached out and grabbed my headphones off of my head gently. I turned in the bed to see my mother sitting on the other side, looking down at me sympathetically.

"Hi, pumpkin," My mother babied me, caressing my face tenderly with her paw, wiping away my tears. I always loved the way she comforted me, and I still do, even though I'm much older now. "How are you doing?"

"I'll be better soon," I whimpered feebly, sniffling as I wiped away my own tears, pushing her paw away. Even though I loved it when she cared for me, I didn't want to feel like a toddler at age 22.

"No you won't, you'll be an emotional wreck for the rest of your life," I heard a younger voice tease as Calico jumped onto the bed, appearing from behind Mom.

"He's right," I heard my father say with a hoarse voice, subtly limping his way over to my side of the bed, holding a tray of four mugs. I could only guess what the contents were.

He placed the tray on my right bedside table and sat down on the ledge of the bed, opposite to Mom and Cal.

"Dad, I'm supposed to be caring for you, not the other way around," I complained, sitting up in the bed. "You should be getting rest."

"You know I can't when my kids are in distress," He smirked, reaching for one of the mugs and handing it to me.

It was still steaming and the heated ceramic material warmed my paws as I took it. I could smell the sugary-sweet mix of the hot cocoa inside, sending heartfelt feelings of nostalgia through my body. I felt right at home, the worried feelings and emotions starting to fade away for a brief moment. Dad then proceeded to hand out the other drinks.

"You're lucky you're getting this sugary drink at such a late hour," My father said as he handed one of the mugs to Calico. "You have school tomorrow, you better not stay up all night." Cal nodded mischievously and immediately slurped up the hot chocolate, only to gasp in pain from the heat. He began to fan his singed tongue while we all snickered.

"Slow down, bud," I chuckled.

We all drank my father's famous hot chocolate with love and care, enjoying the taste and the warm feelings they provided. I felt my body sink further into the pillows of the bed, settling in almost too quickly.

"Hey, Sky?" My mother said, setting down her mug on the dresser to the left of the bed. "Can we talk to you about something?"

"What's wrong?" I asked, leaning in.

"Nothing's wrong, it's... just..." My mother hesitated, turning to Dad and Cal, nodding for their approval. "We think you're making a mistake, Sky."

"What do you mean?" I asked, placing my mug back on the tray that still stood on the right bedside table without finishing the drink.

"Sky..." My father sighed. I felt the atmosphere grow thick once again, growing a little tense myself, yet intrigued by what they had to say. My Dad had that facial expression that you would see on any father's face when they were about to give you a whole lecture about life.

"You can't leave him... You love Charlie. When you're with him, you're happier than I've ever seen you. And when you're not, all you ever do is talk about him." Mom and Cal released a breathless laugh together. I just stared at my dad with concern, beginning to regret my decisions. "I've always liked him, we all do. Personally, I've admired Charlie since the moment I laid eyes on him. He's good for you, Sky. You can't pass that up."

"We're not breaking up, we'll just be in different places," I reasoned.

_Why are they doing this? I was so sure that what I was doing was right... But, now... I'm not so sure anymore..._

"Sky, you know that won't work," Mom lamented, leaning in and petting my head gently. "It won't be good. For you nor Charlie."

"It'll work," I whined with a scoff, tears starting to flood my eyes once again as my voice broke for the fiftieth time today. I tried so hard to make sense of my words, but my emotions were getting in the way, just like they always do. "It has to. It has to work."

"Sky, you have to go with him," Calico told me, crawling over to me and sitting next to me in the bed. "If I'm agreeing with Mom and Dad, you know I mean it. I'm serious."

"No, I need to stay here! For you guys! I need to care for my family, don't I?"

"Hon, can I be totally honest with you?" Mom faltered, closing her eyes and interlocking her paws. I awaited her response with dread. "In my opinion... I feel like you're unknowingly using us... as an excuse to not leave home."

"W-What?" I stuttered, taken aback by what she had said. I pulled my T-shirt over my legs, feeling my body and heart grow smaller in size.

"Sky, you have separation anxiety," My father told me, causing me to turn my head back to him. "And you're mistaking it for having the need to care for us."

"You've never wanted to leave your family, Skyler. You've never wanted to move on to bigger and better things, Sky, y-you never even wanted to grow up. You were so scared to go to college that you cried several times in the airport. You couldn't let go of us," My mom chuckled a little, her eyes now welling up with tears. "Every time you were away from your family or this house, whether for school or vacations or whatever, you've always longed to come back. Do you notice how you never cleaned out your room before you left for college? You knew that you'd be back. You thought college wouldn't last, and that you'd come back to a home, left the same way you remembered it. But, what happened?"

"You met Charlie," Cal smiled awkwardly, trying to find his place in the conversation. I exhaled in subsitution for a laugh, rolling my eyes.

"I know that you're scared of becoming an adult, leaving the nest, and stepping into the unknown," Dad shook his head, deep into thought. "But, buddy, it's a part of life. Times change. People mature. They move on."

"You're scared of the real world. You're scared of growing up," Mom added. "Trust me, I know that fear. It's a parent's worst nightmare, sending their kid out into the real world. Every day, for years, I watched you leave the house and walk to school on your own, and I got sentimental every time, knowing that one day, you won't be here anymore. You'll be out there." Mom pointed out the window, into the distance.

"But we'd always knew that you'd make it. We always had faith in you, Sky." Dad assured me, sitting closer in the bed. "Moving out is good for you, Skyler, you'll be with Charlie. You'll find a job. You'll be taken care of. I know you will. I've always had faith in my son."

I looked around the room, analyzing each of their faces.

_Do they mean it? Have I made a huge mistake?_

"But, what about you guys?" I fretted, scratching my paws over my T-shirt-covered knees.  

"We'll be fine!" Cal groaned in annoyance, pushing my shoulder back and forth. "God, you're so emotional, Clouds." I laughed once again, gaining my confidence back.

"Are you sure?" I asked them all, wiping my tears away.

"Well, if you think about it, you've kind of been focused on Charlie all week and not looking after us like you promised, so, yeah, it's a valid reason to kick you out," My dad joked sarcastically, cueing a laugh from all of us.

"Crap, I'm sorry," I giggled through my sniffles and dampened tears.

My Mom, Dad, and Cal all looked at me with love and comfort, giving me the strength to feel good about leaving. They all smiled prominently, fishing out a smile from me.

_They'll be okay, Sky._

_They will._

_No need to worry._

_Birds leave the nest. It's life. It's perfectly fine._  
  
  

_Charlie..._

"So, what do I do?" I wondered, placing my paws back onto my knees.

"Go after him, Sky," Dad pressed, flinging his paw at me as if it were obvious.

"I don't even know how to‚ÄîWait, I forgot," I mumbled, reaching into my pocket, pulling out the folded-up slip of paper that Charlie had given me earlier.

I unfolded it, pressing down the creases and holding it up to my face so I was able to read it.

It was a pamphlet about the house that Charlie was talking about. The one that he said was 'perfect for the two of us'. The images showed a mid-century modern designed exterior/interior, cozy little beach house, medium in size, right on the coast of the Santa Monica Pier.

At the bottom was the address.

"Okay, I'll, uh, I'll go tomorrow," I agreed, folding it back up putting it back in my pocket.

"What? No! Go now!" Cal pressured, holding my shoulder, digging his nails into my fur.

"What?" I raised my eyebrow at him. "It's late at night."

"That doesn't matter!" My mom beckoned, placing her paws on my knees. She seemed excited, like a teenage girl hyping up her friend to ask out the guy they really like. "You're all set! You're awake, you basically had coffee, you haven't undressed or anything, LA's not a long drive from here‚Äî"

"‚ÄîIt's three hours!"

"Who cares! You gotta go."

"I haven't even packed a bag or luggage or anything."

"Well, do it now!" My dad suggested, leaping off the bed, coughing a little, and reaching for the suitcase that I had unpacked about a week ago. He then opened my drawers and shoved some of my clothes into the luggage. My mother glanced at him, seemingly about to say, 'I got it', but she noticed my father's determination and left it alone.

Cal immediately jumped off the bed as well, grabbing my sketchpad, computer, and other electronics and placed them in my computer bag.

"Guys‚Äî" I tried to speak.

"C'mon, Sky, you can do this," My mom cheered me on, placing her paws back onto my shoulders in encouragement. Cal and Dad slammed down the packed bags on the bed as my mother pulled the blankets off of me. The three of them mingled and stood at the foot of the bed, looking down at me with wide eyes and bright smiles.

_I looked at each and every one of them._

_They love me._

_They understand me. They'll do anything for me. They're perfect for me. I wouldn't be who I am today without their existence in my life. I owe everything to them._

_We may have had our ups and downs, but in the end, we're still family._

_And I love them. Each and every one of them._  
  
  

"Thank you," I spoke to all of them. "For being so caring of me." I was reduced to even more tears.

"Go, Sky!" They all said in unison.

Instinctively, I got up from the bed and grabbed the luggage, heading for my bedroom door. As I did so, they kept shouting words of support while egging me on.

_I'm coming, Charlie._

I looked down at myself, trying to check if I was missing anything.

"Heads up!" My father called after searching his pockets and pulling out his car keys, tossing them to me.

I squeaked, flinched, and shied away, the keys hitting my shoulder with a loud jangle, my family wincing.

"It's okay! I'm fine!" I panted, reaching down and picking the keys back up carefully. "How do I get the car back to you?"

"Will figure it out later, just go, Sky!" My dad forced, shooing me off with his hands.

"Are you sure that you guys will be okay without me?"

"GO, SKYLER!" They all shouted simultaneously.

"ALRIGHT! I LOVE YOU GUYS!"

"GO!"

# 7. MOVING OUT, MOVING IN, MOVING ON

\~~~

## Charlie

I spent the night at a hotel just a few miles off from the house I would be viewing. I had spent the last few months looking for houses to rent, imagining what it would be like to live in it... but for some reason, I had added Skyler to those visions. I imagined what it would be like to buy a house with him, even though I knew he wouldn't be joining me.

After taking a shower and getting dressed (I wanted to look presentable, so I went for the old-fashioned suit-and-tie), I packed my things, checked out at the front desk, and left the hotel. The chilly morning air hit me once I had gotten into my car. I pulled out my phone, hoping for a message or at least a missed call alert from my boyfriend, but sadly, it had read 'no notifications'. I sighed in disappointment and placed my phone down on the dashboard, starting the car and pulling out.

The drive was about twenty minutes. I turned on the radio and tried to tap my fingers to the beat of the overplayed, poppy, upbeat tune that sounded over the speakers, yet I couldn't find myself connecting to it. Sky always had a better taste in music than me; he always analyzed songs and their lyrics, pointing out the production and songwriting in his favorite studio albums. Two years ago, he told me that he had wanted to start collecting vinyl records for his dream house once college was over. He wanted to build a shelf for them on a blank wall and display them next to his suitcase Victrola. He would spend afternoons playing them while he painted in the sunset, or sipping tea, or reading books.¬†

Two years ago, Sky imagined having a quiet life. When I searched for houses, I looked for that imagination and found a house that suited that exact dream.¬†

But, he won't be there to live it out.

_God, how am I going to be able to do this without him?_

I turned off the radio and brushed my paw through the fur on my head, calming my nerves. I looked out the left window, watching the palm trees pass by as they covered the rays of the sun, which reflected off the glass and flared through my vision.¬†

Then, without warning, my eyes closed, taking advantage of the quiet, peaceful moment. I felt myself fade into a memory that had taken place years ago.

_I was six. It was my oldest memory, and one of my happiest, too. I couldn't remember how I had gotten there, or what had happened after, but I was in the street outside my house, trying to ride a bike for the first time. Well, really, I was just sitting on the bike as my mom pushed it from behind, allowing me to pretend I was riding it on my own._¬†

_I was howling into the wind, trying to press my sandal-adorned feet against the pedals as they spiraled out of control. I attempted to gain control of them, but my feet couldn't grip the fast-moving objects and kept tripping off. I kicked it once, and it had spun around and knocked me in the ankle. It didn't take anything away from the moment, though._

_I looked up at the trees as they passed by, blocking the sun every few seconds before disappearing from sight. I felt the wind against my fur, the touch of my mother's paws on my shoulders, and began to fade into this state of mind in which I felt... safe. Free. Like when I was sitting behind Skyler on his bicycle._¬†

_And, in the spur of the moment, my feet attached to the pedals, and I began to cycle them in a motion that allowed me to ride the bike on my own._

_I kept riding, faster and faster, my mother's grip loosening. She laughed and said to slow down, but I was too hyped up on adrenaline and my legs were cranking too fluently to halt. I felt my body stand up on the pedals, my mother letting go of me._

_I rode down the street, gliding through the air, feeling the happiest I had ever been in the six years in my life._

_It was a brief moment, but the feelings I had felt during it were so euphoric and gleeful that the seconds dragged out to hours. I was a soaring bird through a sky of infinite wonders. I had forgotten about the world for a second, but only a second at that._¬†

_I lost control and the bike hit the curb, causing me to fall over and onto the grass of the lawn of our neighbor's house. As I had said, it was a brief moment, but the feelings thankfully lasted._

_I laughed hysterically on the grass as my mother cheered for me, clapping and flailing her arms in the air from down the street. I looked at the distance between us, noticing how far I had ridden a bike on my own. I was so proud of myself. My mother kept jumping for joy, making me smile wider._

_But, the thing that made me smile the most was what I saw behind her._

_My father stood on our front lawn, his hands in his pockets, watching me and my mother exult with exhilaration and triumph._¬†

_He was smiling._

  

_It was once my oldest and happiest memory._

_Because I had made my father smile for the first time._

  

_But, now, the only happy memories I hold on to are the ones of Skyler._

  

The sound of a car horn jolted me back to consciousness, causing me to slam my foot down on the break before I hit the oncoming vehicle in front of me, trying to pass through. The car wheels screeched as the driver ahead steered to a halt at the same time as me. He shook his head and stuck up his middle finger before driving off. _The streets of LA are colorful, are they not?_

I shook my own head, took a second to catch my breath from the startling close encounter, and returned back to the present. I drove the rest of the way to the house without any other issues, thankfully.

I drove into a less crowded, more suburban topography as the car made its way up a road. The road sat on a hill that stood on the coast of the beach, small metal fences blocking my car from tumbling down a cliffside and into the sand. Looking over the landscape through the window, I could already tell it was a beautiful view and definitely one I would love to look at every morning as I woke up. _But, no view could compare to waking up to him..._

I parked my car in the small, concrete driveway of a secluded, medium-sized house. It was one story, yet it basked in the daylight, surrounded by fields of grass and two oak trees that stood on either side of the yard. The house had a spruce wooden exterior, a roof that slanted in both directions from a split in the middle, and almost every wall was a window or a door. I took a second to admire it before indulging. It was homey enough from the outside, and a perfectly good place to start out in LA. It reminded me of the house in the movie, 'Malcolm and Marie', and I couldn't believe how affordable it was, too; it was a miracle that it landed in my price range. I would eventually have to deal with the finances, but for now, I'll settle in with every ounce of tranquility I can acquire. I start filming in a week or so, so I have time to move in and set everything straight.¬†

I cracked opened my car door and slid out after removing the keys from the ignition, soaking in the cool, salty, beachside air as it breathed life into my soul. I've always loved the feeling of wind. I've said it multiple times now.

I walked up to the front door, hearing the soft, delightful tune of a wind chime as it swayed back and forth through the morning breeze on the terraced roof of the porch. The porch itself had room for only two chairs and a coffee table, but it felt welcoming enough (as portrayed by the 'welcome' mat beneath my shoes). Next to the door, there were small letter decorations nailed into the outer wall, reading, '680 Foley Lane'. I rang the doorbell without hesitation, turning back to look at the front lawn before anyone answered. My eyes landed on a 'for sale' sign staked into the grass, along with a picture and the name of the realtor that would be selling the house to me. Her name was Kiernan and she seemed like a promising young woman. She also looked a little familiar, like I had seen her somewhere before, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Looking through the front, transparent glass door, I could already see the inside; and though it was mostly empty, it already seemed like a great house for me and Skyler.

_I mean_‚Äî_for me._

Suddenly, the woman perked her head into the room that stood behind the front doorway. Her eyes lit up and smiled as she raised her hand apologetically, walking up to the door and opening it. It made a crisp creaking sound, not the one that's annoying, but sort of satisfying.

"Hi! Are you, uh‚Äî" She looked at her clipboard. "‚ÄîCharlie Cooperton?"

"I hope so," I nodded with a chuckle. She laughed at the joke and scribbled something down.

"Haha, alright!" She beamed, placing the clipboard under her arm and holding her paw out for me to shake. "I'm Kiernan Spellman and I will be your realtor for today, I hope I can interest you in this household."

"Nice to meet you," I smiled, taking her hand.

She seemed sweet. She was a tall and defined female Shiba, most likely in her twenties, and wore a suit and tie, just like me, along with earrings and sharp eyeliner. I already enjoyed her aura and walked into the house when she stepped aside, motioning me to come in.

The first room I walked into was the living room. It was wide and spacious and had a polished wooden floor with natural finishes. There was floating furniture with tapered legs, for example: a threaded couch with patterned pillows standing in the middle of the room, facing the left wall that had displayed a large, flat-screen TV over a stone fireplace. It wasn't a real one, though, it was one of those remote-control-operated machines that lit a fire every time you pressed a button. Apart from that, there were wide windows and blank walls with white and gray coats of paint, wooden shelves, and a wooden plank tiled ceiling that slanted up to an apex on the roof. Other than that, everything else was left unbothered and some spaces left empty for the buyers to modify and fill. The whole interior screamed mid-century modern and felt very keen to my style of home decor. I could already see the lovely backyard beach view through the windows ahead, the morning sun shining over the horizon, and the sound of waves crashing against the shore, calling my name. I can already see a good life here. It excited me to know that in just a few moments, it would be mine.

Again, to the left stood the only wall that wasn't windows. The fireplace I had talked about earlier was installed in the middle of eggshell-colored drywall, adorning various doors that most likely led to a kitchen or a bedroom or a bathroom or... you get the point. This was only the living room and there was far more of the house to explore.

"So, is there someone else joining you, or are you on your own today?" The woman asked as she pulled her clipboard back out, clicking the tip of the pen to continue scribbling. The reverb of her voice that echoed off the walls of the interior felt perfectly inviting and didn't irritate me. I really did like the place.

"Ah, just me," I laughed awkwardly. "Hopefully, I won't feel too alone living here, haha." I attempted at conversation, admiring the aesthetic of the house. Kiernan suddenly looked up at me, pausing for a small moment.

"Oh, uh, you're living here alone..?" She asked, her expression shifting in a confusing way. I looked back at Kiernan,¬†detecting her obvious change in mood.

"Yeah, is that a... problem?" I questioned, suddenly feeling a little nervous. _What if it really was too good to be true?_

"Well, the thing is, this place was listed as a two-tenant household. You saw that on the listing, right?" She winced, squinted her eyebrows as if she were sharing bad news. I probably did, but was too fooled by my own daydreaming of Skyler being my roommate. "You're one of the many potential buyers that have visited. There were other happy couples who have sought interest in this household, and I can't exactly hand it over to a singular tenant. My shareholders would not be happy with me if‚Äî"

  

That was the moment I heard the front door open and close, rhythmically.¬†

I heard petite, short footsteps make their way closer to me and Kiernan.

  

_Every ounce of hope in me believed that it was who I wanted it to be, but another part of me shook it off, saying it was just some other stranger._

_Life doesn't work like that. This isn't a romance movie._

_It's not him._

  

"That won't be a problem, then," The soft, delicate voice spoke.

  

_No, it can't be..._

_But, it sounds just like him..._

_Please, be him... Please..._

  

I turned around slowly, setting my sights on a lovely, tabby house cat with bright, baby blue fur, patterned with pastel pink stripes covering his arms and face, reflecting the exact colors of funfair cotton candy. I saw eyes as vibrant as the sunset, ears pointed upwards with optimism, whiskers thin and dainty, a nose as small as a button, unique and colorful clothing, and a look in his gaze that felt so familiar.

I felt my body and mind grow warmer with an instinctive passion.

  

_Skyler._

_He came._

The tips of the feline's mouth curled upwards once we had made eye contact. He rubbed his hands together, both anxiously and excitedly, one paw on the other. He tried to remain still, yet he shifted his feet ever so slightly. It was as if he was worried about his intrusion, yet happy to be here, with me. His facial expression spoke telekinetic words to me. _'Sorry I'm late,' he said._

I smiled back at him. From that moment on, I knew that it was destiny.

  

After our subtle, beautiful moment of eye contact, I realized that we had been staring at each other for a few seconds too long. Kiernan watched us awkwardly, confusion building. Skyler turned his attention to Kiernan, walking up next to me nonchalantly, playing it cool as if he were always meant to show up later. He grabbed my paw, weaving our fingers together like a knitter. From the moment I left for the airport yesterday, I longed to feel him again. Little did I know that I'd be feeling his touch sooner than expected.

"I'll be joining him," Sky stated confidently, squeezing my paw.

He looked back up at me, grinning as my amazement became obvious on my face. I immediately tried to hide my smile, closing my mouth and biting my lip. I couldn't hold it in.¬†

Skyler had come.  

He had come.

"Alright!" Kiernan bubbled, her shoulders bouncing with joy.

I couldn't take my eyes off of him. It was a little strange, my silence, as I kept gawking at him with a spark in my eyes, but Sky nudged me and brought me back. He's always there to keep me on my feet.

I tightened my grip around Sky's paw. _'I'm happy you're here,'_ I communicated with my hand.¬†

Sky squeezed my paw back. _'I don't think I could ever do this without you.'_

I compressed his hand one last time. _'I hope you like this place, I think it's perfect for us.'_

_'I'm sure I will.'_

  

Kiernan showed us around the living room, giving us a walkthrough of the house and presenting it with safekeeping and attention. She really did know the place inside and out. Kiernan told us to imagine what we would do and how we would make the house our own if we really did go through with renting it; what life would be like to live in a luxurious place like this. Sky was absolutely in awe of the house, somehow becoming the talker of the two of us, expressing his excitement and his ideas of what he could see as the potential for the interior. I kept smiling as Sky kept fantasizing. He brought up those ideas he had for his dream house that he had told me way back when, obsessing over how to make them a reality. I stood by his side, smiling pleasurably as the kitten gushed his heart out. He loved the place. So did I.

Kiernan opened one of the doors on the left and led us into the kitchen, which also seemed very spacious, contrasting the small appearance from the outside. The house has a lot to it, many secrets to uncover. It was almost like it was alive itself, the thought eerie, yet enchanting. The kitchen had many aspects to it, including marble furnished counters, a steel dining table with extendable chairs and stovetops, polished wooden cabinets and drawers for glasses, plates, silverware, etc. An unplugged and empty fridge stood next to an oven and a dishwasher, which both lied dormant under the countertop that had a sink as well as blank surfaces for items such as knife blocks and plate racks. Sky marveled at the unlimited opportunities. Once, he subconsciously opened one of the cabinets to see if anything was inside, but of course, it was empty, which made me laugh at his naivet√©.

Then, Kiernan directed us to another door in the kitchen that led to a short hallway. It broke off into two directions, one path leading back to the living room through one of the doors on the drywall barrier, and one path leading to more rooms. One of those rooms was a bathroom, one of them was a closet, and one of them was an empty living space that was made purposefully for an office of sorts. The whole room was completely vacant, open for modification, which I had seen in the photos of the place before actually visiting. It was also what I looked forward to the most, mainly because of what I was about to do.

Before we had even entered the room, I grabbed Skyler's shoulders from behind and dragged him into my arms, my chest touching his back. I placed my paws over his eyes, removing his ability to see.

"What are you doing?" He scoffed with a laugh, blindly placing his hands on the wrists of my arms.

I nodded to Kiernan. She opened the door and I guided Skyler in, still with my paws over his eyes. I looked at the unoccupied room and was electrified by the size, realizing it was bigger in real life than in the photos.¬†

"Just imagine this in your mind, Skyler," I whispered into his ear as Kiernan smiled at us.¬† "Art studio. This whole room, all for you and your work." I pulled my paws away, allowing Sky to visualize it for himself.

He took in the sight of the bare room, and almost immediately, his jaw dropped at the image. He began to squeal and jump up and down, thrilled over my idea. He bounced up and hugged me. It made me happy to know that he saw a life in this household as well.

After that, we made our way down the remainder of the short hallway to the room at the end, where it all went down. The bedroom.

Kiernan opened the door and we made our way inside. Just like the other rooms in the house, it was broad and roomy, waiting to be filled with items and furniture.¬†

It was almost like the bedroom had two halves to them. When you walk through the bedroom door, you enter the first half of the room, where the walls are more closed-in since there are two separate rooms to either side of you. To the right, you have your own personal bathroom,¬†which was very clean and tidy. It had these pretty lightbulbs over the mirror that took up almost the entire wall, a walk-in shower, a bathtub, a toilet, a sink, cabinets for other toiletries, and every single thing was shiny and designed with great detail. To the left, there's a giant walk-in closet that had rows and rows of hangars and bars to put your clothing and suitcases and dresses and suits and literally everything in.¬†

After you make it past those two doorways, you enter the second half of the bedroom, where the walls open up more on either side since there are no more rooms in the architecture leading on. From then on, it's just open space. The ground was covered with a soft, furry carpet, reminding me of the carpet at our old apartment. It made me feel at home.

There wasn't any furniture installed in the bedroom yet, so the king-sized mattress of our soon-to-be bed laid on the floor, next to the left wall, in the middle of the room. Ahead, there were more large windows that could slide open and allow you to walk out onto a balcony that stood above the beach view. It also had large, draping curtains for privacy.¬†

Thinking back to how we had decorated our own room in the old apartment, I examined the blank plaster walls and glanced at Sky, who also appeared to be thinking the same thing. We knew that we could fully decorate the shit out of this place in a week or so.¬†

We could make it ours.

And that went for the whole house. We could make it ours with just a bit of a Charlie-and-Sky touch.

We walked back out into the hallway and went down the branching-off route instead that led back to the living room, completing our journey. There was also a basement that held a washing machine, a dryer, a groundwater source, a fuse box that powered the electricity, and more, but we decided to check it out another time.

Kiernan thought it would be a good idea to take us out to the backyard porch so we could admire the view of the beachside. We walked up to the north wall of windows straight ahead, allowing Kiernan to unlock the glass doors and slide them open for us to step out on. We walked onto the wooden patio, a fence blocking us from falling down the hillside. Below, we could see the beach, clear and without a person in sight. The patio was also wide in area as well, having room for a couch, a small table with chairs, and a pole that had one of those burner heaters so we could stay warm in the cold. It could also be swapped out for an umbrella if we ever needed it.

"Hey, Sky, check it out," I said, laying my back down on the couch, my head facing the sky above. I chuckled, thinking he was looking at me, but after sitting up, I watched as the cat stood leaning next to the railing, his arms resting on it. Sky was looking out at the view, admiring the beauty of the beach, tasting the salt in the air, listening to the sounds of waves and seagulls bickering in the distance. Everything about this place felt, as I had said before, too good to be true.¬†

Kiernan nodded to me, knowing it was about time she gave us some personal space.

She walked back into the house, opening and closing the sliding glass doors, leaving me and Sky alone on the balcony.

I stood up from the couch and walked up next to Skyler, resting my arms on the railing as well. The chill of the steel fence against my tired limbs felt like heaven.

"I was wondering why you didn't call me," I teased, nudging him in the shoulder.

"I drove all night, there was no cell service," He spoke in a calm manner, resting his chin down on his arms, admiring the view with a peacefulness that seemed to generate from inside of him.

"So, you really did drive that whole way, just for me?"

"Charlie..." Sky whispered, his voice melting into the breeze. "Do you remember Valentine's Day, four years ago, when we were on that Ferris Wheel?"

I attempted to recall the memory he had pointed out, but my mind came up blank.

"I had said that I wanted my dream house to be by the beach," He reminded me, still gazing out. "And I wanted there to be a balcony, standing tall above the sand, looking out amongst the ocean." That was when he stood up, straightening his back, his hands still on the railing. "This is exactly what I had imagined."

"You know I pay attention," I semi-lied. I forgot about the whole balcony thing, but everything else was meant for Sky's pleasure. I was most definitely considered lucky for finding such a perfect house.

Sky tilted his head at me, sliding his right paw down the railing to reach my left paw, placing it on top. He stroked it, caressed it, and eventually, I turned my paw over for him to intertwine his fingers with mine. We held on, tight, looking back out amongst the beach, the sun in the sky, the shine reflecting off the water as little glimmers across the ocean, making it look like a sea of tiny diamonds.

"Charlie," Sky addressed after a deep sigh. "You were right."

I wanted to say something along the lines of 'told you so' to lighten the mood, but I decided to let Sky have his moment.¬†I knew that a sincere, personal speech from him was in order, so I lied in wait.

"I've always been afraid of stepping out, and you know that. I never knew what the future held, so I never took any chances. I stayed in my box." Sky maneuvered his paw away from mine, sliding it gently from my wrist and up my forearm. "I never came out of it because... I didn't know if I'd survive."

I turned my eyes to him, watching his face morph with emotion and pain. His paw found its way to the crevice in the middle of my arm and I had placed my other paw on it tenderly, stopping it from going any further. Sky sloped his head down, staring at the hillside below, full of rocks and dried weeds.

"All my life, I felt as if I were too fragile to even exist," He continued. "I never took the chance to learn, I never allowed myself to grow... until I met you."

I exhaled through my nose as a substitution for a small laugh, quiet in hoping I didn't ruin our moment. Sky smiled once again, finally facing away from the view and turning his head to me.

"It's you, Charlie. It's you," He proclaimed, deep affection in his eyes.

"I'm what?"

"You're it. You're everything, Charlie. You're what I want. You're all that I want."

I stepped closer, turning my whole body in his direction, Skyler doing the same. We both interlocked our hands, appreciating the fine serendipity of this consequential moment. Skyler had come to me, willingly and without fail. And he had made it in just the right time. It really did feel like fate; a connection, a bond built better than any other in the universe. For the first time, life was on our side at this moment.

"There's nothing more I could ask for," Sky's fragile voice confessed. "All that I could ever want is to be here, beside you. All that I could ever want is to love you. And if I'm going to waste my life, I'm going to waste it with you."

We both laughed, tears forming in both of our eyes. We stepped closer to one another, the space between us diminishing step by step. We were now face to face, merely inches apart.

Sky cupped his paws on my neck as I placed my own hands on his tender waist. His body always felt forbidden and unachievable, which made it so exciting for me, every time I felt his touch. The texture of his fur, the frailty of his skeleton underneath. He's an artifact meant to be handled with care.

"If I'm going to live my life, I'm going to live it properly," He stated breathily, our muzzles close in contact. "And that means moving on from the past. Moving on from that box I placed myself in. If I'm going to move on, you have to promise me you'll be by my side, holding my hand, throughout the entirety of it. Just like you did before."

"I promise, Skyler."

"And I promise the same to you, Charlie."

And just like that, our reconciliation was complete. We finally closed the gap between our faces, connecting our lips, kissing passionately on the porch balcony that stood over the beach horizon as birds soared above.

_It was Skyler's dream._

_And mine too._

The kiss was incredible. As we parted our lips and gasped for air, I couldn't help but feel that this was the start of something new. Every day, it's something new.¬†

Every day, Skyler introduces some emotion I've never felt before, and yet, they all relate back to the feeling of love.

Every day, I fall in love with him, harder than the last.

And like Skyler had said before, that's all I could ever want.

Skyler is all I could ever want. For the rest of my life.

  

"Is that a done deal?" I asked him as we both collected ourselves from the wild experience that kiss generated for the two of us.

"I guess so, Charlie," Sky giggled, nodding his head and squeezing his eyes shut, not able to contain his joy.

"Alrighty, then," I smirked, abruptly leaving him on the balcony and sliding the door to the inside back open. "KIERNAN, WE'RE BUYING A HOUSE!" I shouted as loud as possible.¬†

Sky laughed and covered his face with his paws in embarrassment. I whooped noisily, causing Sky to blush even more. Kiernan walked over and laughed in reaction as well, happy to let us take the place off her hands.¬†

"WE'RE GETTING A HOUSE! WE'RE GETTING A HOUSE!" I kept cheering over and over, submerging Skyler into my arms as I bounced up and down, dragging both him and Kiernan into my celebration. She was happy to be a part of the moment. We all yelled with thrill, adrenaline pumping through our vocal chords.¬†

_We're buying a house. We're buying a fucking house._

\~~~

The following week involved a lot of money and almost nothing else.¬†

Kiernan set us up with our choices, giving us options, the best prices, navigating the two of us through the transaction while protecting our interests. She alleviated many of our concerns and was a trustworthy partner, to say the least.

In a few day's time, we had rented the house. It was ours.

But, then came the hard part.

Both me and Skyler had to go back to our childhood homes for one final time.¬†

Before we knew it, our rooms were empty, filled with brown cardboard boxes that held our precious valuables. Though _my_ room had looked almost the same to me, for Sky, he had never seen his room so empty before. It was always filled with objects, paintings, and decorations that related to his personality, but it was empty now. He had to take down all the posters, all the lights, and paint over the colorful walls with a thick coat of white. It was sad for him at first, but he got over it, thinking about how he would use the items to decorate the new bedroom.¬†

When a heavily occupied room becomes empty, it opens a new door for new possibilities. It led to another empty room, ready itself to become heavily occupied. It's like good karma, one man's trash is another man's treasure.

Those empty rooms I described would be the rooms of our new house.¬†

Skyler was ready to leave his old home behind and find sanctuary in the new home. Even then, it was hard to move on from the household that had given him so many years of life.¬†

It wasn't as hard for me, but I had the same trouble letting go of those thoughts and memories I faded into, like the one of the bike, my mother, and the smile on my father's face.¬†

But, eventually, both Skyler and I left our childhood where it was always meant to stay: behind us.

The day had come. The two moving trucks for our separate houses were packed to the brim. Sky had hugged his family members. I had said goodbye to my father.¬†

We would be moving out and moving on from our past, our childhood, our protection from the dangerous outside world. We would be moving into the unknown, where there was no safety net, no cushion for you to fall on, and no happy endings. Moving out, moving in, moving on. The whole process was like sailing a dark, vast ocean with oncoming storms and deadly waves, wading by with nothing but a threadbare liferaft.

But, the best part was, we would be doing it together.¬†

Me and Skyler.

_Charlie and Skyler._

Though the worst may come‚Äîthe horrors of an unexpected future inevitable‚ÄîI knew that no matter what happened, Sky and I would have always each other.

If the world came crashing down, we would have each other.

Because, we loved each other.

And that's all we could ever want.

  

_So, here goes._¬†

_What does life have in store for us?_

_I guess we'll find out together._

# 8. HAUNTED HOUSE

\~~~

## Charlie

After the long and grueling process of clearing out our rooms and packing the moving trucks was over, we hauled our infinite supply of cardboard boxes into the house. It still amazes me that we have a home, Sky and I, all to ourselves. So many memories were made at the old apartment, who knows how many we could make here. It was a fresh start, a great opener to the painstaking journey that would be adulthood.

It took several hours, but once the moving truck was completely vacant and all the heavy boxes were stacked on top of each other in the various rooms of the new house, Sky and I rejoiced. '680 Foley Lane' was now listed as under the property of Charlie Cooperton (and Skyler Clawfield).

The sun was beginning to set after a long and tiring day, and once the movers who helped us with the boxes had driven off with their truck, Sky and I took one last tour around the house. This time, we directed it ourselves.

We started by chasing each other around the spacious, vast halls, removing our shoes and socks to feel the floor with our bare feet. Sky hid behind boxes as I pretended to be a zombie again, searching for his flesh to feast on. We then walked out onto the balcony as the sun actually began to set.

We looked out at the view, still marveling that it was ours. I mean, it was unbelievable. You don't normally find a house this astonishing with such a perfect price. We would only be renting it, though, buying it in full is a whole other story.

Sky searched in the various boxes that lay in the living room and pulled out his suitcase Victrola, along with a 7" 45 RPM vinyl record he owned for ages. He plugged it into the outlet that was on the balcony and carefully placed the record on the metal tip. He turned on the machine and the record spun around in a rotating motion. He carefully slid off the casing of the needle and held it above the first few indents of the record, pushing the small lever down. The needle then lowered onto the record, static emitting from the speakers.

I sat on the couch, sinking into the cushions and the breeze, watching him stand up, waiting for the tune to start playing. Suddenly, an upswing of drums and guitar sounded, playing the first few notes of 'I Want To Hold Your Hand' by the Beatles. Sky tapped his foot and nodded his head as the song increased in volume. I sat up and leaned over, resting my chin on my fist, intrigued to see where this was going.

When the lyrics began, Sky held up his fist to his mouth to symbolize holding a microphone, dramatically turning his head to me and belting the lyrics: "Oh, yeah, I'll tell you something,"  

"Wow," I mouthed as he rocked his head back and forth to the beat exaggeratedly.

"I think you'll understand," Sky continued, his off-tune vocals making me laugh. Sky held his hand out to me, beckoning me to join, singing: "When I say that something, I wanna hold you haaaaaand!"

He tried to pull me up from the couch before the next line, but he was too weak for a strong husky like me. I stood up chuckling, joining him on the wooden platform. I wove my left paw with his right paw and placed my right arm around his waist, Sky doing the same with his left arm.  

"I wanna hold your haaaaaand," I joined in with a complicated riff, my voice actually in tune. Sky smiled widely, containing his laughter, face-planting into my shoulder. I continued to sing as we swayed back and forth to the music, dancing like Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling in La La Land.

"We need a song for the two of us," I interrupted my own singing as the song went back to the verses.

"Wouldn't it be this song?" Sky questioned as we continued to alternate our feet in a rotating pattern.

"Nah, everyone knows this song," I cracked, holding my arm up and twirling Sky around in a circle. Sky blushed and giggled as he returned to the same position of our bodies, perfectly. "We need a special, exclusive song that relates to the both of us."

"Challenge accepted," Sky nodded his head, trying to lift his arm in order to twirl me, yet I was too tall for it. It ended up being an awkward, clumsy, waddle of a spin. We both laughed at our failure and went back to swaying back and forth. "What about that song we slow-danced to at 'prom'?" He added finger quotes just for good measure.¬†

"You remember that? I can't," I recalled, Sky replying with another nod.

"I guess we just wait and find one," He compromised, squinting his eyes.

That was when the song slowed to a stop, fading in volume. The sound reduced to only the static made by the needle running over small dust bunnies and indents in the PVC.

"Isn't another song supposed to play?" I wondered after the prolonged silence.

"It's a 45, it's only one song," Sky informed me with a shrug, separating from me and picking the record up off from the machine, shutting the Victrola off. "Sun's nearly gone now, we should get ready for bed," He spoke as he closed the suitcase, flipping the metal latch to lock it shut.

Tonight would be our first night sleeping in the brand new house. I didn't even know how I would be able to sleep with all the excitement built up in me, but I might be tired in a few hours or so. Nobody in LA goes to sleep at 7 PM.

"Finally, we can cuddle," I flirted as Sky picked up the suitcase. He rolled his eyes and smirked, walking back into the house through the sliding window doors.

I took one last look at the view, the sun barely breaching over the ocean horizon. Now, the sky was a darker blue, clouds becoming darker in visibility as flying birds disappeared, soaring up into the unknown.

"This is it," I whispered to myself. "This is all that I want."

\~~~

The bedroom was just as bland as it was before. The mattress was still lying in the middle of the room and there was no furniture taking up any space. The only thing that looked different was the incredible amount of boxes piled up everywhere.

Sky placed the suitcase beside the wall and back flopped straight onto the mattress. He immediately regretted it, though, as he began to groan in pain, the wind knocked out of him.

"You're so pathetic," I teased, doing the same to prove his weakness.

_Well, all I can say is, karma is a bitch._¬†I regretted jumping onto the mattress as well, since it was as hard as a rock. It sent a steep pain through my body, and I felt as if I had gotten a concussion from the impact of my head. Sky released an out-of-breath laugh as I attempted to growl from the pain. We both burst, chuckling nonstop. Sky placed his arm around me, snuggling me from my side.

"New mattress?" Sky proposed, looking at me sideways in the bed.

"New mattress," I agreed.

Sky struggled to stand up, making his way into the walk-in closet. I sat up, wondering what he was searching for. He came out of the closet, a folded-up blanket resting in his arms from his old room, along with his decorative pillows. I mockingly tilted my head as he jokingly threw the items at me. I giggled from the impact, pulling the blanket and pillows off of me.

"Why didn't we just buy new bed stuff?" I wondered aloud as Sky crawled over the bed, grabbing the pillows and placing them at the head of the mattress.

"I like the feeling of my own blankets and stuff. It's just something about, like, I don't know, the texture, the weight, and the smell of them that just make me feel comfortable. I'll feel at home, almost," Sky rambled, touching them up so they looked at least somewhat appealing.

"You're so strange," I bantered.

"Shut up. And sit up."

I did what he said as Sky unfolded and spread out the blanket, making sure it covered each edge. We didn't have any sheets yet. "We'll get new stuff soon, so this is just for now," He informed me, flattening and patting it down. I sat back onto the mattress.

"You think we should get one of those bed frames that have those long poles and bars so you can hang curtains on each side of them?"

"You really want our privacy, huh?" Sky rolled his eyes.

"The more privacy we have, the closer I can get to you in bed," I smirked, leaning in and kissing his cheek.

"Okay, Romeo, calm your hormones," Sky grinned, pushing my face back. He touched both his paws to my cheeks and kissed the tip of my muzzle. "When are we going to shop for stuff, by the way?"

"Well," I began, shifting and sitting straight up, ready to share my plans. "My idea is that we start out as is, and slowly begin to renovate it as time goes on. I wanna be here to fix up the house with you, but I'll be busy for the next month, so let's just get used to the house before we change it."

"So many exciting things are happening, this house, filming starts for you tomorrow..." Sky gushed, sitting with his legs up, wrapping his arms around them. "I'm coming with you, right?"

"Of course you are, you're my little assistant," I tapped my finger on the tip of his nose, causing him to look flustered. "That is, until you find your own job and I'm not the only one paying for this place."

"Are we going to have one of those housewarming parties? Like, where we invite people to take a look?"

"Do you want a housewarming party?"

We both looked at each other, a hint of indecisiveness in both of our expressions. Sky winced subtly, scrunching up his face.

"Nah," Sky answered, the word dragging on a bit. "I want this to be special to the two of us. Like, our own private hideout, you know?"

"Thought so."

I looked back around the room, staring at the blank walls that could use some modifying.

"I do have a proposition for you, though," I brought up.

"What is it?" Sky intrigued.

I sat up and crawled behind him on the mattress, placing my paws on his shoulders, directing him where to look.

"You see that wall?" I said, pointing out the obvious. Like in every other direction, there was a blank, white plaster wall to the right side of the room, which sat in front of us by the way we were facing. "Paint it."

"Paint it?" Sky repeated as a question, turning around and facing me. "Like, what? Whatever?"

"Anything you want, Sky."

"Really?" He tilted his brows in confusion. "You sure there's no guidelines or regulations or anything? Certain things you don't want?"

"Whatever your little heart desires."

Sky nodded slowly, biting his lip, trying to act calm and collected; though I knew he was excited by the challenge. He always loves a new art challenge from time to time, desiring the experience to learn more and add to his methods. He's very skilled with his art, and for all we know, he could coat the whole wall in an hour. He has all his equipment in a box, sitting in the empty room, which will eventually become his art studio.

"I'll think of some ideas," Sky then, slowly this time, flopped back down onto the mattress. He sighed, the short breath seething through his closed teeth, the sound reducing to a shushing noise. "God, I'm so tired from all that moving... and dancing..." He sighed deeply. "I feel like we should be celebrating, but I'm too tired to even be enthusiastic about it."

"I've got an idea," I chirped, standing up and walking over to one of the boxes to the far left of the room. On the side, it was marked with a single 'fragile' sticker. I ripped off the taped seal, opening the two flaps that scratched together to make an unpleasant nose. I reached inside, sifting my paw through packing peanuts until it hit the object on top. I picked up the box set of wine glasses that Claire gifted me a while back. I put that under my left arm and stuck my right arm back inside, shifting my paw through the various contents, searching for a certain object. Multitasking is one of my many talents.

I felt the rim of a wine bottle and pulled it out, staring at it with contentment.¬†

"You ever had wine?" I turned back around and walked back over to Sky, who had sat up. His eyes widened once he had set his sights on the objects in my hand.¬†  

"Nope," He shook his head.

"Well, today's your lucky day."

"Where'd you get that?" Sky questioned, a little shocked.

"Stole it from my dad's wine cellar before I left," I confessed with a scoff, sitting down next to him on the mattress.¬†

Sky then shot a death stare at me, showing his obvious disappointment in me. I knew he would react this way. "Relax, it was only one bottle. He already had so many."

Sky still glared at me, tilting his head with dissatisfaction.

"Besides, this is nothing compared to what he's stolen from me, okay? It's about time he'd get a taste of his own medicine," I muttered, handing him the heavy bottle as I held the box set in my hands. I worked my claws around the casing, opening the flaps at the side and pulling out the collection of delicate glasses, connected to a styrofoam base, as carefully as possible.

"Did you even say goodbye to him before you left?" Sky interrogated me.

"Yes, of course, I did, Sky," I mumbled, a little offended that he would think of me like that, yet I pushed it aside. I didn't want to ruin tonight.

It got a little quiet as I reached for two glasses from the base, holding them with major supervision.

"Sorry, that was rude of me," Sky exhaled, scratching the back of his head.

"It's okay, kitten." I flashed a slight smile at Sky as I handed him one of the glasses.

"This makes me scared, I should not be trusted with fragile objects," Sky whined, holding the glass attentively.¬†

"We're basically sitting two inches from the floor," I said as I grabbed the wine bottle, ready to pull out the cork.

"Still," Sky added.

I stuck my pointer claw into the center of the cork and twisted the bottle, pulling it out with a satisfying pop. Sky snorted at my attempt to show off. He's always envious that I can use my claws and he can't, since his almost never come out from his paws. Only on certain occasions.

I tilted the bottle slightly downwards, allowing the dark purple liquid to spill out into the wine glass. The sound of the rhythmic glugging as it poured felt so authentic and classy. I didn't expect to feel so fancy pouring a glass of wine.

"If that spills on the blanket or the carpet, you're dead," Sky warned as I tilted it back up, the glass half-full.

I motioned the bottle towards Sky, who held out his glass for me to pour the wine in. It only trickled down for a few seconds until Sky said: "That's enough." The glass was, like, one-fourth full.

"That's all you're having? I thought we were celebrating."

"I'm not getting drunk again, dude. Remember when you forced me to drink on my twenty-first birthday?"

"Ah, yes, the first time you ever tried alcohol. How many shots did you take until you were flopping all over the place?"

Sky hesitated, a blank expression on his face.

"...Two."

"Yeah, you really can't handle your alcohol, Whiskers."

"Let's just toast already." Sky shifted in the bed, crossing his legs and facing me. I did the same.

We raised our glasses. I had a tight grip around the bottom dome, which made me feel like an expert wine-taster.

I started off with a joke: "To all the sex we shall have‚Äî"

"Charlie!" Sky interrupted, his face reddening.

"I'm joking, I'm sorry," I snickered, staring at his annoyed expression. "What are we toasting to?"

"Well, for starters, buying a house."

"Sleeping in that house."

"Moving into that house."

"Moving out of our childhood homes."

"Graduating college can be one, too."

"Not breaking up."

"To your new job! In which you start tomorrow!"

"To your future job."

"To surviving. The both of us."

"Well, I guess this toast is to us, then."

"To us."

"To Charlie and Skyler."

"Now you're just drawing it out."

"Let's just drink."

Sky and I placed our lips to the rim of the glasses, about to take a sip.

"Wait‚Äî" I gasped abruptly, stopping both of us. Sky was startled, almost spilling his glass, yet he held it steadily.

"What's wrong?"

"Do this," I said, taking my arm and leaning it forward, twisting it around Skyler's arm, our limbs romantically intertwined. "Remember this?"

"Oh, yeah," Sky chuckled, recalling the memory of us drinking the coffees at Amber's, all those years ago.

"Three, two, one," I counted down, finally allowing us both to take a sip.

I gulped down a hefty sum of wine in only one swig, while Sky tasted it in small guzzles. He drank it like a kid trying to consume an extremely hot beverage, cautious of the taste, fearful of the heat. We disconnected our arms. I tried to dissect the look on his face once he was done 'drinking' the wine. He smacked his lips a few times and his eyebrows furrowed.

"Thoughts?" I queried.

"It's very... dry?"

"It tastes 'dry'?"

"Yeah, and it also tastes like dirt," Sky cringed, looking at the remainder of the purple liquid in his glass. "Gravelly, dry dirt."

"Wow, Sky."

"It tastes like, like, you know that kinetic sand stuff you see in toy stores, and when you put it in water, it stays dry? That's what it feels like‚Äîthat's how it tastes. Kinetic dirt. That was put in grape juice." Sky was basically taunting me now.¬†

I chuckled as I took another sip with his mindset. Even though I liked the wine, that was exactly what it tasted like. I smacked my lips and picked up the wine bottle, reading the label.

"You just wanna order a pizza?" I suggested.

"Yes, please."

\~~~

After finishing the whole pie (I've always hated watching Sky eat pizza‚Äînot because he's a messy eater, he's actually one of the daintiest eaters I know‚Äîbecause he eats it with a fork and knife. I mean, what kind of psychopath eats pizza with a fork and knife?), we brushed our teeth and freshened ourselves up in the very nicely lit bathroom. The counter was cluttered with toiletries, as we weren't ready to organize everything just yet. We'll probably be up for it tomorrow.

I opened the bedroom windows to air out the room as Sky brought the empty wine glasses to the kitchen sink along with the cardboard pizza box.

Sky changed into his signature plaid pajamas as I stripped down to my underwear. After shutting off the overhead light, we both hopped onto the rock-hard mattress and prepared for sleep. Sky lied to the left of me in the 'bed' as I snuck closer, placing my arms around him. I exhaled deeply, resting my muzzle in the crevice between his neck and his shoulder. He squirmed a little from the tickle, but he rested up next to me with a delighted sigh.

His eyes watched the ceiling, yet he didn't seem ready to drift to sleep. It looked as though he was focused on something, mentally.

"What are you thinking about?" I whispered, tilting my head with interest.

Sky slowly turned his head to me as if he didn't hear, the words buffering in his head.

"Do you see that?" Sky whispered back, still staring at the ceiling.

I looked up, trying to detect what he was looking at, yet I came up short.

"See what?"

"There's a crack in the ceiling..."

I revolved my head back up to it, squinting in the dark. As the blur adjusted to clear, I noticed a small, crooked line in the gypsum wallboard surface.

"Oh, do you want me to fix that?"

Sky hesitated for a second before turning his head back to me.

"No, leave it," He said, a hint of a smile on his face.

I didn't know what caused it, but Sky's cheeriness rose even higher than it was before. He cuddled deeper into me, closing the gap between our whole body. Not one part was separated. I brushed my paw through the fur on his cheek, touching his whiskers tenderly as Sky melted into the feeling.¬†

"We finally have a place all to ourselves," I praised, sighing in relief. "No other people to worry about, no Cal's or Jonathan's to barge in when we're busy‚Äî"

"You always enjoyed it when Cal came in, don't lie."

"Yeah, you're right."

I leaned up and grabbed the blanket, which had somehow been pushed to the foot of the bed, and pulled it over the two of us, providing us with warm coziness. This whole house felt cozy. Sky felt cozy.

"Goodnight, Sky," I spoke, closing my eyes.

"Goodnight, Charlie."

"I'll see you in the morning."

\~~~

But, when I woke up to sounds of heavy breathing, it was still in the middle of the night.¬†

It felt as if no time had passed at all and I never even slept.¬†

I was dangling above the line between asleep and awake.

My eyes were closed, yet, I felt the surface of the bed as it seemed to shake unusually.

I just thought it was a dream... until I heard a soft, suppressed whimpering coming from the kitten in the bed next to me.

_Sky... He's... Something's wrong..._

I forced my mind to wake up, opening my eyes on command.

It was blurry at first, but at last, I set my sights on Skyler.

Tears were streaming down his face as his body convulsed violently.

It sounded like he was choking, his breathing sporadic and rapid.

Once I had fully gained consciousness, I sat up in the bed, looking down at the poor trembling cat with horror. My whole body singed with doom and worry.

"Sky! Are you okay?!" I exclaimed, instinctively placing my two paws on his waist and his chest, caressing his body in order to calm him down.

Sky tried to speak, but nothing came out. It sounded like a voice was trying to escape his throat, yet his vocal cords weren't allowed any freedom. Only tiny, suppressed squeaks released. His face and body were frozen solid, yet it shook and convulsed like crazy. It pained me to watch him like this.

_This has happened before. Many times, actually._

  

_But, it's been a while since the last seizure._

"Hey, Sky, remember what the doctor said, alright?" I informed him, stroking my paw against the side of his face for comfort. "Clench your fist, alright? And breathe, slowly."

Sky attempted to nod his head, tears clogging his eyes. His facial expression looked so scared and helpless, I felt so useless. I wanted to help him so bad, but this issue was inside of him, and there was nothing I could do but tell him what he already knows. What he's already been trained to do.

"Breathe, Skyler, breathe. Clench your fist." I kept rubbing my paws over his waist, back and forth, trying to soothe him. Sky kept whimpering in pain, not able to gain control of his body. It was as if his mind was detached from his limbs.

He closed his eyes, squeezing the tears out as a muffled wail sounded through a shut mouth. It was his way of pleading, 'I can't do it', to me. Over the course of the past four years, these attacks have taken hours of sleep from him. Sometimes the attacks were mellow, but other times they completely took over his strength and will, killing his power and his hope. Every attack abused him, mentally.

I knew because he had told all this to me, alongside his family, his therapist, and his doctor.

"You can do it, Sky, come on!" I pleaded, almost brought to tears myself. "You've done it so many times before, you can do it." I spoke sweet nothings of support, developing his ability to push through. If it weren't for my encouragement, Sky would have even more difficulty.

Sky began to pull himself up from the bed, clenching his fist as told. His face emitted so much pain as he persevered through the struggle. I placed my arm behind his back once he had lifted himself up enough, guiding him. He attempted to reach for me; my embrace being the finish line, the prize to this immense obstacle.

With a few more excruciating cries for help, Sky was so close to sitting up fully.

He was almost there.

I kept supporting him through the issue, holding him dearly.

Once his back was fully straightened and he had successfully sat up in the bed, he immediately collapsed into my arms, gasping for air. It was over. He gained back control over his body once again.¬†

I wrapped my arms around him, tending to his needs. Sky began to cry a little, desperately drawing in his breath as I rubbed my paw against his back.

I kissed his forehead, trying to give him all the serenity needed. Sky sucked up as much air as possible, sniffling and breathing heavily, causing him to sputter out with a few hoarse coughs. He choked violently, hacking uncontrollably while I was trying my best to calm him down.

"Deep breaths. It's okay, sweetheart... It's okay..." I kept whispering into his ear, repeatedly kissing his forehead.

Sky groaned in relief, pulling back from my tight embrace. He placed his paws to his temples, rubbing them as though he had just had a terrible migraine. I stroked my hand through his sweaty fur, gently touching him. He was so fragile.

"Let me get you a glass of water," I said quickly, sitting up to leave the room.

"Don't go‚Äî" Sky moaned, tugging onto my hand before I could make my way off the mattress.

"I'll be quick, I promise," I assured him, leaping off the bed and running to the door in a hurry.

I raced down the chilly hallway and barged into the kitchen, grabbing a plastic cup from one of the cardboard boxes and filling it with cold tap water.

I swiftly paced back to the bedroom, careful as to not spill the water.

Sky was still sitting up in bed, the blanket over his back. He was waiting impatiently for me, longing for my return. I sat on the mattress, slowly passing the cup to him. Sky took it graciously, his hands trembling. He placed his mouth up to the brim and chugged the water like a man parched in the middle of the desert.

"Don't spill," I alerted, tiny droplets of water trickling down his face. I placed my paw on his arm, gently tilting and guiding the cup back down so it wouldn't spill over anymore.

Once Sky got ahold of the glass, I quickly sat up once more, running into the bathroom, turning on the light. I was a little blinded at first, but it was helpful as I searched through the various items we left on the counter, looking for Skyler's medication. We'll organize everything tomorrow, hopefully.

Once I finally found it, the orange-tinted bottle, I screwed the cap off. I dropped one small, white pill into the palm of my hand and turned the light off, returning back to the mattress.

I handed the pill to Sky and he tossed it in his mouth, drinking the rest of the water afterward to wash it down.

Sky gave me back the empty glass and took deep breaths, gaining his posture back. He wiped the remaining tears off of his face and looked up at me, his eyes reflecting sorrowful emotion. I felt so bad that he had to go through this. He looked like a nervous wreck.

"How do you put up with me?" Sky spoke with a husky tone of voice.

"What do you mean?" I worried, sliding in closer, placing my paws on his legs.

"I'm such a mess," Sky sniffled, shaking his head as his eyes watered even more. "Yet, you're always there. It almost feels like you enjoy caring for me."¬†

"Because I do, Sky," I convinced, grabbing his paw and holding it tight.

"How? I feel like such a burden all the time."

"You're not a burden, Sky." I inhaled and exhaled fluently, finding the calm in the storm. "You're just trying to live properly. And that really hurts sometimes."

"I'm sorry, Charlie..."

"Hey, don't apologize."

"I thought the episodes were over for good this time."

"Well, they haven't been happening in a while. The last episode was months ago. You're making progress, it's just, like... they're spreading out periodically."

"So, they're never going to go away? They're just going to spread out?"

"I know it sounds bad at first, but just think, every time you have an attack, it delays the time before the next one."

Sky nodded his head, looking down at our paws as they held each other caringly.

"Do you think it's bad luck? The house is haunted?" I joked, trying to lighten the mood between us. I realized how often I try to do that. I mean, it works, right? "First night in the new house and you have another episode?"

"I honestly just think it was all the wine," Sky laughed listlessly.

"You had one glass."

"You said it yourself, I can't handle my alcohol."

We both chuckled softly, looking back down at the mattress.

I eventually brought up the question I knew neither of us wanted to confront.

  

"Did you see him again?"

Skyler looked up at me, knowing exactly who 'he' was.

_The wolf._

"No. I didn't see him."

"Well, I don't know about you, but that sounds like progress to me."

"Charlie, it doesn't matter if I see him or not," Sky appointed. "I felt him. I sensed him inside of me. The image of him is gone, lone gone, but the fear is still there."

"Why are you still scared, Sky? He can't hurt you. That was so long ago."

"It's not just him, it's the man in the alleyway too, and that bear at the party... and all the other people who tried to get to me... take advantage of me... and... well, just me, myself, in general." Sky whimpered, closing his eyes. "I'm scared of myself and that I hurt him. That I did what I did with that tablet‚Äî"

"It was self-defense, Sky."

"But, I almost allowed myself to be taken advantage of. I could've saved myself from him. From all of them. But, I was too weak to have control over my own body."

"Skyler, those happened years ago. Why are you dwelling on the past now? Why tonight?"

"I don't know, Charlie. I'm always trying to find ways to hate myself."

"We all have parts of ourselves that we hate but are stuck with," I reasoned, putting my hand on his shoulder.¬†

"An incident like that, it doesn't just go away. It stays for years."

"Oh, sweet thing," I sighed with sadness, placing both of my paws on his face with a mind manner. "You're constantly hurting... You've gotten the worst of it lately, haven't you? What can I do to help, Sky?"

"You've done all you can, Charlie. I couldn't ask for more from you." The look in his eyes seemed so reluctant, yet, he gave in. "But, for now, just soothe me to sleep," Sky begged, leaning forward and collapsing back into my arms in exhaustion.

"Alright, scaredy-cat," I chuckled, petting his head as gently as possible.¬†

I lied back down onto the mattress, still cradling a traumatized Skyler in my arms.

As I was pulling the blanket over the two of us, I had a random idea. I pulled it all the way over, completely and fully submerging both Sky and I under the warm darkness of the blanket. It was pitch black, but I felt strangely closer to Sky with the tightened barrier. It was like a cocoon, and in the morning, we would both emerge better than before.

"What are you doing?" Sky scoffed, pushing the cover out of his face.

"Shh, we're in the womb," I jested, causing us both to snort with laughter.

"Ew, you're so weird," Sky gagged through giggles, holding onto me, securely.¬†

"_You're_ weird."

"You're drunk."

"So are you."

Our faces were touching at the tips of our muzzles. We could feel our humid breaths on each other's fur. It may seem claustrophobic, but to us, closure is all we desired. We both had a hankering for each other's touch. It was what gave us both life.

Both of our eyes were shut, our bodies dormant, our hearts and minds at rest.

  

"I'm so happy I'm here, Charlie," Sky whispered for the final time of the night. "I'm so happy I decided to move in with you."

"I'm happy you're here with me, too, Sky," I responded, setting each other at ease. "Now please, get some rest, sweetheart. You deserve it."

# 9. RAMEN NOODLES

\~~~

## Skyler

Charlie kept nuzzling the tip of his nose into my neck in an attempt to tickle me awake. The feeling was enough to make my morning: the touch of his bare chest and muscular limbs lying on top of me, caressing my face as he kissed and licked my neck.

Waking up to Charlie's physical affection, plus the calming silent serenity of our private, secluded house by the beach... _Is this it?_

I always imagined that in order to become an 'official' adult, you'd have to have your own home. Young Skyler always feared growing up, leaving his family to live alone as an adolescent, but luckily, present Skyler has someone to spend adulthood with.

So, you could say, my first day as an 'official' adult has begun. Or maybe it'll be the day when I get a job. Or maybe it was when I graduated college? Or enrolled in college, even?

Who knows what day you start adulthood on. It's different for everyone, I'm still technically settling in. Coping, kind of.

But, on the contrary, I have a good feeling about today. Let's hope I don't screw anything up by being an immature, emotional mess.

_Well, I do feel kind of drowsy right now, but maybe that's just a result of my sleep paralysis last night._

"Good morning, Sky," Charlie said with a delightful tone, dropping a quick peck on the tip of my nose.

I suddenly felt a tingle in my nostrils, bringing me to an eventual sneeze. I shoved my face into my left elbow and pushed Charlie away with my opposite hand. I sniffled and grunted at the sudden occurrence and rubbed my nose with the back of my paw.

"You okay?" Charlie asked, sitting up in the bed, the rays of sunlight from the windows making patterned lines down his bare chest. He suddenly became concerned over one sneeze.

"Yeah, why?" I cleared my throat after hearing my groggy voice.

"You're kind of sniffly this morning," Charlie raised his eyebrow.

"I'm sure I'm fine," I assured him, but he didn't look convinced. He sat up from the bed and walked over to another box in the corner of the room, leaving me conflicted. "Charlie, I'm okay, really," I called after him.

"You've said that multiple times before and it ended with you having terrible colds," He called back as he probed the box he had opened.

"I'm not sick, it was one sneeze," I complained, followed by an ironic sniffle. Charlie usually overreacted when it came to me, but I did sound a little hoarse.

He pulled out a thermometer from a first aid kit and walked back over to the bed, sitting down with his legs crossed. He scooted up to me as I sat up, crossing my legs as he did. Charle placed his paw on my chin as I tried to take the thermometer from him, but he pulled it away at the last second and stared me down.

"I'm not a kid, I can do it myself," I told Charlie, but it went right through him. When it comes to rebelling against him, he's a brick wall.

"Open wide," He instructed as I rolled my eyes.

I opened my mouth, touching my tongue to the roof of my mouth as Charlie placed the plastic thermometer in. I closed my mouth down on it, sinking the metal tip into my saliva. Charlie exhaled deeply through his nose as we both sat there in silence for about a minute.¬†

Charlie smirked, eyeing me with a hint of provocation.

"Don't talk much, huh?" He teased. I just glared at him.

At last, the thermometer beeped and Charlie pulled it out of my mouth, turning it sideways and reading the number on the tiny screen. He stared at the results with increasing doubt building on his face.

"What does it say?" I asked, a little off-put by his expression.

"It's hot," He told me.

_Crap._

I nodded my head somnolently and looked at the floor.

"Okay, so just stay in bed, okay?" Charlie suggested, placing his paw on my arm.

"Wait, but I thought I was gonna go to your first day of work with you," I whined, tilting my head in disappointment.

"It's okay, Sky, really."

"No, it's not. I was going to support you."

"Your health matters more."

"No, it doesn't."

"W-What do you mean? Of course, it does," Charlie laughed it off, obviously concerned about what I had said.

"I... I didn't mean that, I‚Äî" I faltered, shaking my head.

"Sky, I love you, but you know how protective I get when... this happens."

"Yeah, I get it, I'm weak and unable to fend for myself since I'm such a pussy," I grumbled with an attitude, lying back down on the bed.

"Sky... You know what I'm talking about."

"What are you talking about, Charlie?" I taunted, beginning to feel my anger building up.

"Okay, is it just me or did we both forget that you're an HIV patient?"

"You think I would forget that? After everything that happened to me?" I shot my body straight back up, a little irritated.

"Your immune system is weak, Sky. It struggles to fight viruses, even if it's just a common cold. You know how worried that makes me‚Äî"

I didn't know why Charlie was beginning to tell me things I've already heard before. It was starting to push me over the limit.¬†

"What, are you my doctor now? Are you gonna ask me if I'm still taking my meds?" I huffed, crossing my arms. "Believe me, I take those goddamn pills every day, not to mention my unlimited supply of antidepressants and mood stabilizers. Let me make it clearer by counting it out for you," I began to point up my fingers, counting them one by one. "ART,¬†imipramine, lamotrigine, every day, every night, I sedate myself so much that I can't even think. God, I feel like a fucking guinea pig."

I hadn't had time to fully gain my clutch on reality just yet, so my mind was just doing whatever it was doing. I didn't mean to react so harshly to Charlie's protectiveness. I had somehow messed everything up before the day even began.

So much for this being a good day.¬†  

"Sky, you're lashing out. Calm down, please, let's talk this out," Charlie comforted, scooting closer and placing both paws on my shoulders. There are times where I feel like he's afraid of me, especially when I curse. "No need to get angry, alright?"

"You telling me that makes me angrier."

"You said you didn't want to fight."

"I don't!" I moaned, covering my face with my paws, slouching over.

"So, please, stay home and get some rest. For me, at least."

"I wanted to be there for you. I wanted to be supportive," I exasperated, slamming my fisted paws on my crossed legs.

"I know that, Sky. You don't need to show me. I'll always know."

I sighed dramatically with annoyance and distress, feeling my body fall forward. My head hit Charlie's chest as I sunk into him, allowing him to pet my head gently.

"I'm sorry for being such a nuisance."

"You never will, Sky," Charlie promised, brushing his paws back and forth down my spine and my shoulders. He guided his hands to my head, landing them on my cheeks. He tilted my head up to face his. "You're too cute to annoy me."

That got me. I tried so hard to contain it, but a small smile crept onto my face. _His optimism is contagious, I have no idea how he does it. How can a perfect, all-around positive husky like him have such an effect on a broken, moody feline like me?_

"Now, please, for my sake, stay home today. Just until you get better."

"What am I supposed to do? If I just stay in bed, I'll feel useless."

"Well, there's a lot you can do. You can, uh..." Charlie looked around the room, his eyesight landing on all our boxed-up belongings. "...Unpack the boxes and organize things, um..." His sight then shifted to the blank wall. "...You can paint the wall like we had talked about..." He then looked back at me. "...And you could research jobs. That'll be good."

"Sorry that I couldn't be your lovely assistant for your first day."

"I'm sure I'll survive without enforcing labor on you," Charlie joked. "Besides, I don't want to spoil the movie for you. I read the script. It's fucking amazing. And there are plot twists, so‚Äî"

"If you tell me there's a plot twist, that ruins the plot twist."

"True."

I took a deep breath and allowed myself to latch onto Charlie, hugging him dearly.

"Good luck, you dictator," I whispered into his ear.

"Please don't make that my pet name."

"You know I despise pet names."

"If that's so, why do you let me call you‚Äî"

"It's different when it's coming from you."

"That's what I thought."

\~~~

Watching Charlie drive off down the hillside road into the distance while I stood on the porch, already longing for his return, reminded me of something my mother had said to me a few days ago. Every day, for years, she watched me leave the house and walk to school on my own.¬†

I just watched Charlie leave for his first day of work on the set of his new movie. It's a significant time for him, a breaking point in his life, and I just watched him leave. Head out into the unknown.

_Is this what it's like to be an adult? Do these feelings make me an adult? Will I ever feel like I accomplished becoming an adult? I don't think I'll ever know. It's all so complicated._

I walked back into the empty house, hearing the door creak and close behind me. I stood in the middle of the living room, wrapping my arms around myself, taking in the elusive atmosphere. It amazes me how lonely I feel when Charlie is apart from me.

After the 'argument', Charlie freshened up, showered, changed into proper clothing, and we both ate leftover cereal for breakfast since it was all we had. I had then changed out of my pajamas and wore some baggy jeans and an oversized graphic t-shirt, too big for my small torso. It was Charlie's, of course.

Though it started off on the wrong foot, I still have a good feeling that I can turn this day around. I mean, it's only been an hour or two since I woke up. I looked at the clock on my phone, reading '8:34 AM'.

_So, let's see, what can I do for the next several hours?_

_Charlie gave me a list of ideas... the first one was to unpack the boxes._

_Let's start there, then._

\~~~

Beginning in the bedroom, I ripped through the packing tape on all the cardboard boxes and carefully took out each and every content. I ordered all the items into two individual piles according to their use: decorations and personal property. Several paintings, posters, and little figurines of mine fell in the decorations pile. Items such as my Victrola briefcase and Charlie's camera stand landed in the personal property pile. Other things, such as furniture, were outside on the front lawn because it was too heavy to bring in on the first day. Basically a few different desks, a dresser, two bedside tables, and a few chairs. We would shop for more furniture soon.

I put up some posters and paintings and began to make the room feel less desolate. I pushed the mattress up against the wall, saving that spot for our bed frame. I put the Victrola on top of a miniature foldable desk against another blank wall in the room, opposite the walk-in closet. I could install that vinyl shelf I always wanted right here. I placed my and Charlie's personal belongings to the side, waiting to put them, either, on display on our shelves or bedside tables, or in the drawers of a desk.

I walked out in front, settling my eyes on the various pieces of furniture in the yard. Thank God, no one stole anything. I started off with the chairs, the easiest of the bunch. I set a few down in the living room, some in the dining room, and one in the bedroom for the desk I was about to move in. Next was the bedside tables. They were a bit heavier, but I managed to move them through the living room, down the hallway, and into the bedroom, positioning both of them on either side of the mattress. I grabbed a lamp that sat in the decoration pile and placed it on top of the left table, plugging it into an outlet. I grabbed a fox figurine that I used to have in my room and placed it alongside the lamp.

Now, it was the hard stuff. One of the desks and then the dresser.

I tried to push the desk from behind, but it just kept nearly tipping over, making me grow more anxious and cautious of breaking it. I placed my paws on the edges of the desktop, hoping my fingers could latch on and drag it into the house. Luckily, it worked, but it wasn't as efficient as I thought it'd be. It was a slow process.¬†_I wish Charlie were here. He could move all of this easily. I was never one for hard duty labor._

Sluggish as can be, I dragged the desk up the steps on the front porch, through the front door, through the living room, down the hallway, and eventually, into the bedroom. That, on its own, took about twenty minutes. It would be an understatement to call me weak.

I was sweating like crazy and exhausted out of my mind. The fact that I had to tackle one more object was killer. The dresser was huge.

Not huge, huge, but big and heavy enough to slaughter someone if it collapsed onto them. What would it do to me?

Even though it was empty, it would not budge, no matter how hard I tried.

"Crap," I panted, out of breath, a bead of sweat dripping down my forehead.¬†

I looked at the time, noticing that three hours had passed since I had started. It was now 11:45.

"You can do this, Sky, just think," I whispered to myself, rubbing my temples with concentration.

_There's no way I can move this thing on my own. I'm too frail. Is there any way I could make this easier for myself?_

I ran into the house and grabbed a thick rope from the closet with taped edges for better gripping. It was long enough to curve it around the edges of the dresser, which I did. I twisted the two ends so that they'd form a knot, allowing a stronger hold on the dresser.

I held the two ends of the rope under my arms, clenching my limbs down tight on them.

"Here we go..."

I immediately put my whole body into tugging the rope, using up every ounce of strength and will left in my body. A loud groan emerged from me as I heaved forward, step by step.

I was making ground.

I managed to haul the dresser up the steps on the front porch, through the front door, through the living room, down the hallway, and finally, into the bedroom. That, on its own, took about thirty minutes. I was left sputtering and coughing violently, my throat beginning to ache with stinging pain.

_But, lord, was I proud of myself._

I felt a sensation of glee come over me as I wiped my moist brow and shook my paws of sweat.

The sensation soon left when I had realized I had to do the other rooms as well.

\~~~

The next five hours included more hauling and rope burn. I had unpacked the boxes in the art studio, setting up my easels and equipment, along with my favorite desk for sketching, painting, coloring, inking, and almost everything else. I didn't do much to change the kitchen and living room, since they were all ready kitted out with furniture and decorations, but I did leave some finishing touches. I'd like to imagine that nothing is final in this house. Charlie and I will keep changing and adding to it, I know we will.

I took the time to research bed frames for our room, along with a new mattress that didn't feel like concrete. I found myself investigating the Wayfair online store website, pinpointing the bed frame that Charlie had talked about last night, the one with bars for curtains on each side. He really wanted our privacy.

When it was 4:15, I treated myself to a well-deserved shower. It was the first shower that I took in the new house, and it felt pretty damn satisfying. The showerhead had a notable amount of holes for the water to spread out and wash every part of my body, while pointing down at a perfect angle to hit the back of my neck and drizzle down my sides. I loved the feeling of hot water on my fur and skin. It was longer than my usual, already-overlong showers, in which I would spend about thirty minutes or so under the warm water. And I might've spent longer if I hadn't had more things to do.

After drying myself off, I thought back to the list Charlie had given me.

_What was the second thing?_

_Oh, yeah, the wall. He told me to paint it whatever I wanted._

_Let's do that next, then._

\~~~

I looked at the blank, white, plaster wall that stood to the right side of the room, which was faced by the mattress that was now moved to the left side of the room. Our lair was beginning to take shape.

Charlie was right, it did look like it was in need of a paint job. It was too bland for our bedroom.

I got excited, though. I always loved it when people gave me art assignments. In elementary school, when I actually had friends, whenever they asked me to draw certain things, I would become so thrilled and would immediately get to work. Most artists I know hate it when people ask them to draw something for them, but I always loved it. It was a way for me to diversify my work and try out different things.

Looking at the wall, my head was spinning and exploding with all sorts of ideas. Should it be busy with alternating colors, or just a minimalistic pattern that doesn't distract you with absurdity? Should it be an abstract piece or a landscape model? Modernism or impressionism? I could see the possibilities paint the wall in my mind, running through all sorts of images I could create.

I began by pulling out a tape measurer. I measured the wall horizontally from one side to the other. Ready to hear a tongue twister? I scotch taped the end of the measuring tape against the edge of the wall so I could measure the whole area without needing someone to hold it for me. That was a mouthful, but it makes more sense if you saw it yourself.¬†

I pulled out my phone with one hand and typed the exact measurement, in inches, of the wall on my phone. I repeated the same thing, just vertically this time. Then, I walked into my art studio and sat down at my desk, pulling out a slip of paper. I drew the dimensions and labeled the rectangle with the data I took and began to brainstorm. I pencil-sketched several ideas that had generated in my head when looking at the wall before, adding small acrylic color grids to represent the scheme, and picked which one I liked the most.

I was happy with my decision, and I was sure Charlie would like it as well. It would be a new style of painting that I had never done before, which included forming the illustration out of small, patterned dots. But, I was ready for the challenge.

I tossed on my painting smock and tied my signature bandana around my forehead to keep the fur out of my eyes and prevent any future itching, in case my paws were covered with paint. I pulled out my wide, blue masking tape and walked back into the bedroom, ready to start. I taped down the foot of the wall as a barrier so no dripping paint could reach the carpet below. I laid down a blue tarp over the floor to catch rogue droplets. Then, I got out my cans of acrylics according to the color scheme I had chosen. I started my taking my original sketch for reference and gently stroking my pencil against the plaster wall, making a bigger and more finalized sketch. I would paint over these pencil lines, but for now, they were there to guide me on how I wanted to play this mural out. Sort of like a color-by-number painting.¬†

Once the pencil layer was done after half an hour, I started with the paint. I was already fatigued, and I knew that I wouldn't finish tonight, but I began with an initial dotted layer of a light, earthy brown shade. It was a method that I had learned in elementary school, painting individual dots to form an illusion of a solid color running throughout. It was called Pointillism, and it's been used by artists such as¬†Georges Seurat, Vincent Van Gogh, and Paul Signac. You would also see it in the graphics of famous comics, the tiny dots bringing texture to the people's faces. And I would be using it to make a landscape piece. A place that only Charlie and I understood.

\~~~

Three hours later, at 8 PM, it was only one-third of the way done. I painted only certain colors, one by one, so it looked a bit wonky and undetectable at first. But, once it was finished and the whole painting was done, it would look as clear as day. For now, only some parts were filled and some parts were left blank.

I decided to take a break and finish it tomorrow. It felt good to occupy myself all day, concentrate on one certain thing after another and not all things at once. Whenever I had free time to do anything, I would freak out and start to wonder if there was something that needed to be done, causing me stress and anxiety. College really shaped me into an organizer of time, so once I was done for the day, my mind immediately wondered what to do next. It was a habit of mine, I always needed something to do. Always. Or else I would feel useless.

There was one last thing on the list.

But, it was the one I was looking the least forward to.  

_Find a job._

I grabbed Charlie's laptop and opened up a search engine. I've done this internet investigation multiple times before, all to no avail. There were no jobs that suited me and what I wanted to pursue. I didn't know how this time would be any different, but I had to at least try. For Charlie.

From 8 to 10, as the sun had set, I had, once again, found nothing.

There was not one job that interested me. I had been looking for something I wanted to do long-term, something I would enjoy and feel like I'm expressing my talent in the best way possible, but I had come up short. I was done with my phase of part-time shifts, I wanted something real. Something I could be doing for years and never get tired of. Charlie loves filmmaking and photography, and making movies and shooting photos will never bore him, ever. I want something like that, too.

I love to do art for my own personal growth. I just wish there was a way to make a profit off of it.

"Honey, I'm hooooome!" I heard a loud and playful shout, reminiscent of the 1991 sitcom, come from the front door as it opened and closed. The yell echoed throughout the halls and awoke my spirits, bringing light to the house that stood in the rays of the moon.

Finally. This whole day was so damn exhausting. I need time with my boyfriend.

I ran down the halls and rushed into the living room, seeing Charlie place his work equipment down, turning his sight to me. He looked at me with a bright expression on his face, holding his arms out wide. He must've had a great day.

I raced over to Charlie, jumping onto him with glee. We both squealed with delight as Charlie twirled around in circles with me in his arms.

"Oh my god, how was it?!" I beamed as Charlie set me down on my bare feet.

"Jesus Christ, it was amazing, Sky," Charlie gushed, smiling contently. "I don't think I've ever had that much fun on set before, but something about it felt so... electric."

"How'd it go with the director? Um, what's his name, De... Dean‚Äî"

"Deno Yuvi. It was incredible, he's probably one of the nicest people I've ever met. I was so scared to meet him considering how much I looked up to him and his work, but he just relieved all of my doubts the moment we first talked. He let me take control and give input on the visual aspect of the film and asked for opinions on the color grading, the angles, the camera movement, and even some of the blocking."

"That's amazing, Charlie," I bubbled, staring longingly into his eyes, feeling butterflies whisk around in the pit of my stomach. His presence made me so happy.¬†

Charlie pleased my desires and leaned down, planting a firm kiss on my lips, pressing his paws into my back and pulling me in, tight. Even though I was basically sick, nothing could stop Charlie from stealing a quick peck. Thankfully, it was closed-mouth.

"How was your day?" Charlie queried as he pulled back. "I see you've already touched up the place a bit."

"Oh, who cares, today is about you, Charlie. Tell me every single thing that happened, one by one, no detail skipped over."

"I don't want to, that would spoil the movie for you."

"I don't care, Charlie, honestly."

"If you want to care about me, you have to care about my work and care that I know what's best."

"Ugh, fine. Give me a spoiler-free review of the day, then."

"Will do. But, can we eat dinner first? I'm starving."

"Oh, yeah. We need to go shopping for groceries before we starve and eat each other."

"What'd you have for lunch?"

"I didn't have lunch."

"Shit, really? Dude, we gotta fill that bony stomach of yours!" Charlie slapped me lightly on my belly, walking to the door that led to the kitchen.

"Okay, I get that I'm as skinny as a stick, but can you not try and shove it into my face?"

"Ha-ha, Sky."

\~~~  

The only thing we had leftover from the cardboard boxes for dinner was ramen noodles. It was what we would eat together whenever we were alone and low on money, like the time I spent a few weeks at Charlie's house when his father was... away. It was cheap, portable, lasted a while, and most importantly, it tasted like heaven. Didn't matter if it was unhealthy.

As Charlie went over the day, he turned on the stove and placed a kettle full of water over the flames. I grabbed the ramen from one of the shelves and opened the packaging of the bowls. Once the kettle began to whistle, I shoved my paw into an oven mitt and grabbed the handle, pouring the steaming hot water into the two bowls, drowning the dried noodles. As Charlie tried to figure out how to set up the TV on the wall above the fireplace, I mixed in the spicy flavoring and grabbed a fork for Charlie while whipping out my trusty chopsticks for myself. I migrated with the two bowls to the couch in the middle of the living room where Charlie sat. He had somehow already figured out how to turn on Netflix and sign in to our accounts.

It was always our tradition to eat noodles while watching a movie on our laptop, sitting on Charlie's bed in the darkness. We had a list of movies that we wanted to watch for every time we enacted the tradition, plus a few shows that we were binging together. Charlie picked the next movie on the list and settled back with his food, shoving his fork into the steaming bowl. Over the last four years, I've tried, on several occasions, to teach him how to use chopsticks, but it's no use. He's hopeless.

The movie was okay in my opinion, but Charlie absolutely loved it. It's one of those abstract movies that only certain audiences enjoy, and I, for sure, was not in the margin. I get what Charlie saw in it, I just found it rather boring. We both had a playful fight over it.

This felt like a good way to end the day.

\~~~

"Hey, you okay?" I heard Charlie ask me from the bathroom, his voice a little muffled as he brushed his teeth after taking his nightly shower. I had already gotten ready for bed and was in my pajamas, sitting on the mattress, reading a book.

"I still kind of feel sniffly and my throat's a little sore, but I'm sure I'll be fine‚Äî"

"No, I mean, are you... okay?" Charlie questioned sincerely after he spat out the toothpaste in his mouth, walking up to the bathroom doorway and resting his arm on the frame, watching me. He was wearing only his underwear again. He slept like that every night, no matter what temperature.

"Hm?" I looked up from the book I was reading, confused by what he was trying to get at.

"It's, just..." Charlie hesitated as he made his way over to the bed, sitting to the right of me. It was like, facing outwards, the left side of the bed was mine and the right was his. "You seemed a little distant while we were watching the movie, that's all."

"Really?" I furrowed my brows. "I didn't even notice."

"I'm sorry about keeping you home tonight, Sky. I just couldn't risk anything."

"I know. It's okay," I smiled with apologetic eyes, placing my paw on Charlie's cheek. Suddenly, I felt the dampness of his fur as water began to trickle down my hand. "Dude, learn how to dry yourself properly! There's still water dripping off of you!"

"What, afraid to get a little wet, kitten?" Charlie teased me, overexaggerating a frown.

"Please, don't ever say that again."

Charlie then jumped over me with a scream, clasping his arms around me, squeezing me with his whole body, every dampened inch of his fur touching mine. I screeched in retaliation, trying to fight him off, but he was too strong.

\~~~

The lights were off. It was 12:38, yet, neither Charlie nor I fell asleep.

We just laid in the bed, our heads rested on the pillows, the blankets pulled all the way up to our necks, facing each other. We stared into each other's eyes with content, savoring the sweet, tranquil moment before things would go to hell sooner or later.

Today was, somehow, a good day. It may have started off a little sour and continued to be very tiring, but in the end, everything paid off. Charlie returned to the house like a husband would come home every night after working for his family in the olden days. But, in this reality, I was Charlie's family. He was providing for me only.¬†

It made me worried. _What if I wasn't supporting Charlie as much as I should? What if he'll forever be the one working hard while I use up his time and money?_

I don't know how I'll ever be able to repay him after everything he's done for me... and for me only.

"What's going on in that head of yours?" I heard Charlie whisper, catching me in the middle of my mood storms. He always knew when I was dealing with harsh thoughts. He was a mind reader.

"I... I, just..." I attempted, finding the right words to say in my head before speaking them aloud. "You have such a great job... A great life... A career you enjoy. You're pursuing your dreams, Charlie, and you're doing what you love. You're providing for me while I can't even find myself a job. I want to help make money too, Charlie, but nothing is working for me."

"Sky, it's okay, it takes time to find a proper career."

I rolled onto my back and pushed my paws through the fur on my head. The sigh I exhaled turned into a scowl as I stared at the tiny crack in the ceiling. The little sliver of hope that I held onto for good luck.

"Maybe I should... go back to school‚Äî?"

"‚ÄîWhat? No, Sky!" Charlie reacted quickly, scoffing. I turned my head to him as he sat up, looming over me. "No," He spoke again, firmly.¬†

"Maybe it would help me find a career."

"You spent four years trying to find something with your professor, nothing came up," Charlie reasoned. "And, please, don't try and use college as an excuse to hide away again."  

"What does that mean?"

"Sky, in my honest opinion, you're too scared of the real world," Charlie spoke in a light tone in order to make it sound less severe. It didn't. "You would rather go back to a place where you had support, backing, barriers to keep you in shape and mentors to help you through. You hate being on your own. You always need someone to take after you." I felt as though this would offend me, but it didn't. He was right. "And, of course, I can't blame you for that, this world broke you. It demolished you. I just wish I could somehow pick up the pieces and build you back up again."

I felt my eyebrows tilt with agony. Today was his first day at work. It was supposed to be special to him, yet, here he was, coddling me.¬†

It didn't matter to Charlie, nothing would stop him from trying to help me. It could be his birthday and he'd be asking if I was okay.

He really deserves so much.

So much more than what I'm giving him.

"You're amazingly talented, Sky. I know that there's at least one thing in this world that wouldn't pass you up on the chance to exploit your skills. You know enough. You don't need to go back to school. You're fine." He turned his head up to the unfinished wall. "Hell, I don't even know what you're painting, but I already love it! You just have that spark, Sky. Please, don't waste it."

"But, I can't find anything. What if it's going to stay like this?"

"Skyler, you're just a little under the weather. It's messing with your head. Once you get better, you'll feel more ready to get out there and conquer the world."

I let out a small chuckle through my saddened expression. "What would I do without you, Charlie?"

"Let's be honest, you'd be dead."

I knew that that was supposed to be a joke, but as Charlie lied down beside me, ready to fall back asleep, I couldn't help but wonder if he was right and didn't know it.¬†

_Did Charlie save my life?_

_There were so many instances in which Charlie rescued me from the danger of other people... and myself._

_If Charlie were never there... what would I have done to myself? With all the grief and pain that I had been dealt over the years of my existence? What impact would that have had?_

  

I'll settle with no answer for now.

"Goodnight, Charlie," I muttered under my breath, staring down at his chest, unable to face him straight on.

"Hey, sweetheart," Charlie whispered. He rested his paw on my cheek and tilted my head up to face his. He looked at me longingly with eyes of comfort, warming my whole body, figuratively and literally. "It's going to be okay, okay?"

I nodded weakly. Charlie moved in even closer, pulling us both into an embrace, nestling my face into his shoulder. I allowed myself to just relax my nerves and give in, my whole form fading into his chest. It felt like we were the literal definition of two-halves-make-a-whole. He brushed his paw gently, up and down, across my back like he always did.

"It's going to be okay..."

  

_I guess that concludes my first day of being an adult._

_What lies ahead frightens me... but all I know is that I'll have Charlie._

_I always will._

# 10. HOUSEWIFE

\~~~

## Skyler

I'm going to have to get used to watching Charlie leave at eight in the morning every day. It makes me feel so empty, the sight of him disappearing beyond the horizon, watching from the front porch. It was like he was leaving to enlist in the armed forces. I don't know why it had such an emptying effect on me.

I hate that life just had to hit me with a cold during one of the scariest parts of it. If there's a storyteller who writes the plot of all our lives, mine really got lazy. Whoever they are, they just can't seem to let me catch a break. _I just want to stay with Charlie... Go where he goes... Stay by his side..._ I would travel the world with him. I really would. I love him so much, yet, here I am. Stuck at home.

I decided to spend the rest of my morning continuing the wall painting. I used up valuable hours layering on a few more shades of blue, dark blue, a couple subtle purples and earthy greens, and finally, traces of white. I was now at least two-thirds done. There would be some finishing touches needed, and then I would have to remove all the tape, the blue tarp, clean all the equipment, put away all the paints... It's complicated being an artist, but, at least it's something I enjoy doing. I have a habit of looking for the beauty in little things.

As I finally finished up and took a short break, I heard my phone ring on the bedside table. I turned around and walked over to it, noticing that the caller ID read as 'Claire'. My paws were splattered with paint, so I leaned over and touched my nose to the answer button and then directed it to the speaker icon.

"Hey, bestie!" I heard an overly cheery voice holler.

"Hey!" I responded with a smile, walking back over to my station of paints, grabbing a roll of paper towels off the tarp and ripping one free. "It's been a while, how have you been?" I called out as I wiped my paws, dirtying the towel.

"I've been good!" Claire expressed. By the tone of her voice, I could tell she was smiling, too.

"How's it going with the new house? And Jonathan?" I asked as I picked up the dirty brushes and tossed them into a messy bucket. The bucket itself was marked with splotches and splatters of different acrylic paints and substances that built up over the years.

"We're fully moved in! I'm so grateful, the house is beautiful. I'm thinking of throwing a housewarming party sometime soon. How about you?"

I looked around the half-finished room. The empty spaces with no furniture. The mattress without a frame.

"We're... almost done, too!" I tightened my grip on the handles of two paint cans to carry in each paw, ready to carry them back into my art studio.

"Sounds awesome! I can't wait to stop by and check it out!"

"Um... When do you think that will be‚Äî?" I began to lift the heavy cans with a grunt as Claire interrupted.

"Hey, do you need a new bed frame?"

"What‚ÄîYeah, how did you know that?"

"There's one on your lawn."

"There is..? How did‚Äî"

"Come outside, bitch!"

Claire hung up the phone.

"Oh, god," I whispered to myself.

I set the paint cans back down and exited the room. I ran through the hall to the living room, reaching the front door. After stepping back outside onto the porch, I set my sights on a shockingly large vehicle in the driveway. It was a bright red, Fiat Ducato van, shimmering and glistening in the sunlight. It was one of those vans that someone could live in. I placed my arm over the glimmer to evade my eyes from going blind.

I could hear the sounds of two girls shouting and cheering from the vehicle, a voice of an American and a voice of a Brit. The howling of a fox and a wolf in unison. After I put my arm down, I could see Claire in the passenger's seat of the van, Becca at the wheel. They were both flailing their arms around, waving at me with hype and excitement.

A smile formed on my face as they hopped out of the car and ran over to me, jumping on top of me with a massive, suffocating hug.

"Oh my god, guys!" I laughed as they squeezed me with intense ferocity from both sides. What a surprise. "How did you even get here?"

"Charlie sent us the address," Claire informed me as they parted from the hug. "He said you were a little under the weather, so we both found the time to stop by and check-in."

"Oh, you didn't need to," I shook my head, touched.

"Girl, you kidding? We had to!" Claire chuckled, softly punching me in the shoulder, yet the impact was enough to push me back. Claire's smile was infectious and her eyes sparkled effortlessly. She wore her iconic paint-splashed and pen-scribbled denim jacket that she's owned for years (she constantly scribbles on more doodles whenever she's bored) with a striped t-shirt underneath that was tucked into her beige cargo pants.

"Wasn't a long drive, I hope?" I worried, placing my paws together.

"Oh, not at all, I only live about half an hour away," Claire said, pointing her thumb backward.

I turned to Becca, who was staring at Claire longingly.¬†She was wearing a violet-laced crop top with bell-bottom jeans. She also wore a purple bandana around the top of her head along with golden hoop earrings. "Becca, I thought you were traveling?"

"I'm... still saving up, but, I'll get out there eventually."

"Where are you staying now? Do you have a home?"

"You're looking right at it!"

Becca stepped aside, directing my attention back to the van, basking in the sunshine like an old TV car commercial. I widened my eyes a little.

"You... live in a van?" I questioned, touching Becca's shoulder with a bit of concern.

"Okay, I know that seems bad, but trust me, I'm not a nomad," Becca turned back around, taking in the sight of the vehicle. "She's my home for now. I have a lot of hope in her."

"It's a 'her'?" Claire asked with a chuckle.

"Yes, and her name's 'Red Velvet'," Becca defended, crossing her arms. I could only guess the name referred to the van's vibrant color. "She's brand new, don't bully her. I'm thinking she'll be my ride when I travel the world."

"Okay, but that's basically what a nomad is," Claire rolled her eyes and turned to me, placing her paws on my shoulders. "Speaking of homes, can we come inside?"

"It's not exactly... clean at the moment‚Äî"

"We don't judge," Becca added with a shrug, glancing at Claire.

"C'mon, we drove all this way!" Claire pushed.

"Alright, fine!" I chuckled with a sigh, turning around and opening the front door.¬†

"Yay!" Both Becca and Claire cheered, tossing their arms up in the air and doing a little dance as they filed in.

\~~~  

I showed Becca and Claire around the house that was basically fifty percent cardboard boxes. And even then, they still fell in love with it. Claire was so puzzled and shocked by how the house was so affordable, considering how rich and fancy it seemed.

I then showed them into our bedroom, which they also admired. Just like every room that they had entered, they immediately ran straight to the windows to stare out of them. They absolutely adored the view and began to wish that they had the house for themselves.

They also admired my incomplete painting.

"Were you just working on this?" Becca asked as she looked at it with a keen eye.

"Yeah, how did you know? Is the paint not dry?" I answered, turning my attention to the seemingly hardened pigments.

"No, you've got your painting overalls on."

I looked down at my outfit. I was wearing tight, denim overalls with tiny splatters of dried paint all over the material, along with a black, short-sleeve t-shirt that had white words stitched in, reading 'A24'. Charlie had gotten it for me once.

"You always wear either those or an apron whenever you're on a rapid, artistic, Skyler-spree," Becca remarked.

"It's a smock, not an apron," I corrected as I looked back down at the cans of paint. "Do you think you guys could help me out?"

Becca and Claire both assisted in picking up the heavy cans and escorting them back into my art studio. The studio was beginning to fill up as well, my many canvases and stand-alone desk took up the most space, a rack with my old paintings stood in the corner, and a sink for cleaning and washing painting utensils was now built into the wall. The wall itself had pieces of artwork pinned into the plaster. I wanted to busy up the wall like how I would in my old bedroom with posters and pictures. After setting the cumbersome paint cans down, we all limped back into the bedroom and collapsed onto the mattress.

"Ah, what the fuck!" Claire groaned in pain, placing her paws on both sides of her head.

"Ow! This bloody mattress is hard as a rock!" Becca gasped, the wind knocked out of her, but she remained laughing.

"Welcome to my world," I giggled. I had gotten used to the roughness of the mattress, but it was still a pain in the ass.

The three of us lied on our backs in a circle, the tops of our heads touching in the middle of the bed.

"You guys want to do some more manual labor?" I joked, staring up at the ceiling.

"Ugh, what now?" Claire complained with a chuckle.

"The bed frame is out in front," I winced, trying to lessen the impact, though it elicited a whine from both Becca and Claire. "Sorry..."

"No, no, it's alright," Becca spoke out. "We're strong, independent women. We can do this."

"I think you fail to realize that I'm a male sometimes, Becs," I quipped.

"C'mon, Sky, let's be honest, you're one of the girls," Claire spoke.

"Well, let's see if this girl can build a bed frame."

\~~~

The next hour was spent dragging the large package inside the house (It was much easier this time, now that I had help) and assembling the bed frame, piece by piece. It took trial and error, the process of having to commit to engineering that we had learned about in 9th grade. We scrambled around for screws and bolts, we read the manual a few hundred times, and we searched nonstop for YouTube videos that could be of any assistance. Eventually, we got the hang of it, and the frame was assembled. We had moved the deadly mattress out of the way and replaced it with the new one that was shipped alongside the frame. You gotta love Amazon's twenty-four-hour delivery.

We set the new mattress down on the frame, shifting the blankets and pillows back into place, and stood back to look at our work. The bed frame was made of sturdy wood, painted a sage green, that had poles on each of the corners, rising to support beams, running from each pole to another, where the curtain would hook onto. It was at that moment I had realized that I hadn't bought curtains.

Even then, the three of us were proud of what we had accomplished. High fives went around. And some hugs, too.

We then lied back down on top of it.

"Ugh, so much better," I moaned as I felt myself sink into the cushion. It was definitely a step up from the piece of cement that other mattress was.

Becca, Claire, and I just lied there, staring at the cracks in the ceiling as we did before. No word was spoken between the three of us. We just allowed ourselves to take in the peace of relaxation after a hard day's work‚Äîeven though it was only noon.

Claire was in the middle, Becca on the left side of the bed, me on the right. Claire lifted her right hand and tapped me on the shoulder lightly. I turned my head to face her.

"How're you doing, babe?" She asked me politely, her smile exuding so much warmth. Becca turned her head to me as well.

I sighed and closed my eyes, tilted my head back to the ceiling. "I don't know... Things have been so stressful lately..." I placed my paw on my forehead, wiping a small drip of sweat.

"What's troubling you, hon?" Becca asked, a hint of concern in her tone.

_Here I go again, spilling out my concerns and fears like a pitcher full of bad vibes._

"Well, for starters, Charlie and me... We've been in this weird, tense area. He's out there, working his ass off, providing for me, while all I can do is paint and fix up the house..." I sighed, exhaling similarly to a smoker. "God... I feel like a... Like a housewife. I want to do something helpful, you know? I want to be supportive. But, here I am, taking after the house like a mother whose husband lost interest in her..."  

"Sky, you are helping. Fixing up the house is helping," Claire told me.

"But, I want to do more," I whined, frowning. "I want to show that I'm more than just a frail, little kitten in need of coddling and attention. I want to get a job. I want to have a career that I enjoy doing. I want to prove that I'm capable of being my own person."

"Skyler, I'm sure Charlie is well aware of how hard you're trying. He loves you. He knows your potential, he knows your strength. You don't need to prove that to him. He knows," Becca supported.

"I want to prove it to myself, though," I reasoned.

"Well, why haven't you?" Claire wondered.

"I don't know," I whimpered. "I feel so incompetent all the time. I just want to be enough. I just want to feel like I'm enough. For myself. And for Charlie. And for you guys."

"Sky, you'll always be enough for us," Becca assured. Claire looked at me and nodded.

I looked straight back up at the ceiling. Somehow, I can never allow myself to accept people's praise or compliments. I always feel like somehow, I'll eventually let them down.

"Here, you know what?" Claire spoke, sitting up in the bed. "Let's go out for lunch. We can talk it over when we're not actually starving."

"Charlie told me not to go out," I said.

"Well... you got ingredients to make a home-cooked meal?" Becca asked.

"I still have to go shopping for groceries once my cold is gone."  

"Blimey."

"Then let's go shopping. Screw what Charlie told you to do," Claire said.

"But‚Äî"

"Sky, you're allowed to make your own decisions. You said it yourself, you don't need coddling and attention. You can be your own person," Claire encouraged.

"C'mon, Sky, let's go out! Let's take Red Velvet!" Becca tempted as the two of them sat up, leaped off the bed, grabbing their shoes and belongings. I sat up in the bed as well and hugged my legs.

"Charlie's gonna get angry with me... You know how protective he is..."

"Charlie doesn't own you," Claire advised as she wrapped her purse around her shoulder.

"Change into something that doesn't make you look like a mess," Becca instructed.

They both went for the door.

"We'll be waiting out front," Claire said as they disappeared down the hall, their voices echoing. "If you're not there in five minutes, we're leaving without you."

Becca closed the door behind them, leaving me alone in the bedroom.

_Shit._¬†

_What do I do?_

_I mean, they are right, I should be able to take control over my own decisions... but Charlie always knew what was best for me..._

  

_You know what? Screw it._

_I'm an adult. I think._

_I'm allowed to do what I want._

I jumped off the bed and headed into the walk-in closet, searching for something to wear.

\~~~

Ten minutes later, I opened the front door to see that the fox and the wolf had already filed back into the van. Or‚ÄîI mean‚ÄîRed Velvet. Once they heard the door open, they immediately turned their heads to me and began to hype me up. They screamed and chanted words of support and rocked their fists through the air. I blushed and rolled my eyes as I walked over to Red Velvet.

My outfit choice for the day was a faded, blue graphic t-shirt with Japanese symbols, that was baggy by the sleeves, yet short at the hem‚Äîalmost short enough to be a crop top, but not quite‚Äîwith the addition of blue denim jeans with rips at the knees. I had a small, white bucket hat that had been hidden away for quite a while. I found it, deep inside the closet of my old room once I was packing up to move. So, I decided to finally put it to use. There were slits in the curve of the hat for my ears to stick out of. I also put on a new set of earrings that I got from Claire a few months ago and haven't worn yet. It felt good to finally show off my fashion sense again after dressing like a bum for the past few days.

Claire stuck her arm out of the window and slapped the side of the car, pointing to the big door handle that led to the interior of the van. I placed my paw on it and pulled the door open, revealing the inside. It was a large space, and even though it was a van, it felt as though I had walked into a full-on house on its own. There was a nice and tidy bed sitting on an elevated platform in the back of the living space and a small desk with a computer and cords plugged into an outlet on the carpeted floor. And of course, in classic Becca fashion, there were decorations everywhere. She hung fairy lights around the edges of the ceiling and hung up a few pictures and polaroids she took of her and her friends; including me, Claire, Charlie, and Jonathan. It was surprisingly organized neater than me and Charlie's whole house. That place is still a mess.

"Ready, sluts?" Becca started the car.

"Sky, you ready?" Claire turned around in the passenger's seat, looking back at me, sitting on Becca's bed.

There were no seatbelts in the back, but in the words of Will Arnett: in life, there are no seatbelts.

"Let's go!" I told them.

\~~~  

Being able to drive into the city allowed me to actually grasp the idea that I lived in Los Angeles, California. I mean, it looked exactly like what Miley Cyrus pictured in 'Party in the USA'. Everyone seemed famous.¬†

The streets were busy with convertibles and tour buses, people dressed in suits were running in and out of huge stores with walls covered with billboards and posters, surrounding every blank surface. It felt good to finally see the world I was living in: celebrities, fame, opportunities everywhere I looked. I mean, I live with a Hollywood cinematographer. I should be getting with the program.

I guess I just got so sucked into the quiet life with Charlie that I never really got to experience living as my own person in Los Angeles. Sure, it was Charlie's dream, but it felt good to embrace it myself, in my own personal way.

Becca drove into one of those parking garages since it's literally impossible to park on LA streets. The garage itself was filled to the brim, almost every space taken. We had to go up a few levels to find empty slots, and luckily, we did.

We then dismounted Red Velvet and made our way to the shopping mall that was right next to the garage. There were even little hallways on each level that led to the inside of the mall since the garage was built specifically for the mall.

We put the hallway on our level to good use and entered the mall through sliding doors and metal detectors. We found ourselves on a higher floor of the mall and searched for the nearest map that could direct us to a grocery store. We ended up at a Walmart.

With Claire pushing the shopping cart, me searching for items on the shopping list I made, and Becca sitting with her legs crossed in the cart, we went on a shopping spree for groceries. I watched as Claire and Becca acted like kids, running around and pushing each other around, laughing and attempting to keep their voices down. I had difficulty trying not to laugh while hissing at them to stop. We got some dirty looks from other bystanders, but they didn't seem to care all that much. Neither did we.

As Claire and Becca both slowed to a halt, I noticed that Becca was looking at Claire a certain way.

At first, it reminded me of feelings that I've had for‚Äîwell, all of my friends, but mostly them‚Äîfor the longest time.

When I first befriended both Claire and Becca, I couldn't help but notice how pretty they both were. I'm not attracted to them, obviously, but they always seemed so happy and free of doubt. They were like those models that you'd see in those ads about make-up or perfume. Both of them combined, they were the ideal image of who I wanted to be. They both knew how to dress, they both knew how to impress. I've always wanted to be like them. Claire has always been a fashion idol of mine and Becca has also had such a great influence on my art. They were both intimate, loving friends, and powerful, independent women. I loved them. I was _in_ love with them. But, platonically.

It really seemed like they loved me, too. And they loved each other as well. That's really all I wanted in high school. Thankfully, I'm a grateful person.

But, even then, the way Becca was staring at Claire as she laughed began to confuse me a little. It no longer came off as the stare of friendship.

She almost seemed a little too infatuated with Claire.

But, who knows, maybe I'm wrong.

"How's Jonathan, Claire?" I asked, scanning the aisles as Claire suppressed her laughter and continued to push Becca down the aisle in a calm and collected manner.

"He's good," Claire spoke after a bit of hesitation.

"Just 'good'?" I pressed, a little suspicious.

"So, Sky, let's continue our conversation from earlier," Claire changed the subject. "What do you want in a career?"

"That's the issue: I don't know," I admitted as I turned my attention to the aisles of wheat products, pulling out two loaves of bread in plastic wrapping.

"Well, what do you want to do with your art?" Claire said, halting the shopping cart to wait for me.

"I've never really wanted to do anything with it... I just loved to make it," I continued as I looked at both of the packages, deciding which one was the better deal. "There was never a purpose other than me, just, learning and expanding my range of skills."

"Do you ever see yourself as a person who would make art for companies and stuff like that?" Becca questioned, tossing¬†a jar of peanut butter up and down.

"I'm open to anything, art-related, but the thing is, I can't see myself working under‚ÄîI don't know‚Äîbig-brand, multi-million-dollar corporations. I don't want to be like a loose cog in a system. I want to have freedom with my work and take control over what I make. I want something that I can have for myself, I don't want to feel like I'm property or I'm owned by businesses just to cough up media for their own profit," I sighed, starting to get agitated that I couldn't decide on which bread to get. "That's why I can't find anything, no job whatsoever, that gives me that freedom or power. Charlie found it. Not me."

"Okay, Sky? Reality check," Claire interrupted, grabbing the bread in my right hand and placing back the bread in my left hand. "First of all, in the world of employment, there's no such thing as freedom or power. It's all money. So, don't go chasing false hopes." Claire tossed the bread she chose to Becca, who caught it and placed it beside her in the cart. "Second of all, have you ever thought about running your own business?"

"How would I do that?"

"You could make a career online," Becca added, pointing her finger to the sky. "It's actually pretty easy, I would know. And I could help as well."

"Yeah, you could have your own online business, like a shop, but instead of merchandise being sold, you could sell art commissions," Claire leaned her arm on the handle of the cart and raised her eyebrow at me.

"That... actually sounds like a possibility..." I nodded my head, liking the idea of it.

"Yeah, and plus, you'd be able to control what you make by setting rules for buyers, while simultaneously learning new things and expanding your range of skills," Becca said, sugarcoating the idea to make it seem even better. "You kill two birds with one stone."

"And, in the end, I'd still be doing what I love."

I smiled, a sudden feeling of glee coming over me.

_This could be it. This could just be the answer to my problems._

"See? All you needed was a talk-down with ol' Claire and Becs and you're already on the right path," Claire smirked, grabbing the handles of the shopping cart and pushing it down the aisle.

Once we had items, in all the main food groups, stocked piled on top of Becca in the shopping cart, we made our way to the check-out lanes. I went to pay, only to realize that I didn't have enough money. _Makes sense, I'm unemployed. For now, that is._ That was when both Becca and Claire offered to help. I resisted, they insisted. We eventually scraped together enough bucks, a combination of money from the three of us, and handed the crumpled-up dollars and loose change to the irritated cashier. The three of us just stood there and tried our best attempt at a friendly smile.

We left the Walmart, our wrists adorned with the stretched-out handles of various plastic bags hanging from our arms. Our plan was, after we carried the groceries back to the van, we would then stop by somewhere for lunch. We ran down the busy, white-tiled floors, our eyes taking their own visual tours of our surroundings. There were people everywhere, coming in and out of stores, riding up and down escalators, sitting by the water fountain that stood in the middle of the mall and taking selfies... It was everything you could imagine in a shopping mall, but it was an LA shopping mall, so that made it even more busy and hectic.

As we made our way back up the escalator that would lead us to the floor that would lead us to the exit that would lead us to the garage that would lead us back to Red Velvet, we passed by a few women's clothing stores. Becca and Claire kept looking at them, gushing as they saw large posters of stunning models and cute outfits on mannequins, set up to display and attract customers.

I rolled my eyes and followed them, turning my head to see what they were finding so mesmerizing.

That was when I felt my body slow to a stop. There was a certain flower pattern dress that stood in one of the display cases of one of the stores. I had stopped at the perfect time to see the reflection of my face plastered onto the blank head of the dormant mannequin.

I just stood there, looking at my reflection with the image of the dress on me.

I didn't really feel anything in that moment other than... _attraction...?_

_I don't know... Oh, god..._

_No... Stop it, Sky..._

_What's wrong with me..?_

"Whatcha looking at?" Claire asked, tiptoeing up and startling me.

"Huh?" I shook my head, caught off guard.

"Pretty dress," Claire admired, staring at it as well. It felt like she was trying to get something out of me, but I was at a loss for words at the moment. I didn't know what was going on with myself, either. I just felt like a blank slate. No thoughts, head empty.

"Yeah, it's pretty..." I told her, my voice a little quieter than usual. "You should get it. It would look good on you."

I then turned my body back towards the exit and made my way forward, following Becca as Claire remained close behind.

"Skyler?" I heard from behind me.

I would've expected it to be Claire, since she obviously sensed something fishy from that interaction, but the voice sounded nothing like her. It wasn't Becca's British articulation either. I watched as Claire entered the right side of my peripheral vision, joining Becca as they both stared at the source of the voice that stood behind me. They took a few steps backward, in shock.

I turned around, not knowing what I would find on the other side.

It was most definitely a shock.

  

"Skyler Clawfield?" Hugo, Charlie's father, called from the distance, hurriedly making his way over to me.

I felt my body tense up once again. He was a scary-looking adult, yet the similarities to Charlie in his face put me slightly at ease. His fur was a tinge darker than Charlie's fluffy white coat, if not a little messier too, and he was much taller and bigger. If I thought Charlie's size was sometimes intimidating, there was no contest when it came to Hugo. I felt like a rodent under his eyes. He frightened the hell out of me whenever we had crossed paths.¬†

Though I've heard Charlie go on and on about Hugo for over four years, I've never really seen him in person. Or got to meet him, formally. The closest I ever was to him was at graduation. That was the first time he ever spoke to me. I'm sure Charlie has told Hugo about me plenty of times, since he knows my name and what I look like.

Other times, he was either in another room and Charlie had done a thorough job of keeping me out of sight, or Charlie had protected me so much that he had sent me away every time Hugo came to CIVA. Hugo has been trying to reconnect with Charlie on multiple occasions, but he never found a way to get through to him.¬†

Now, here he was, right in front of me.

He didn't seem angry, though, which struck me as odd.

_He seemed... strangely, happy to see me... almost... a little desperate?_

"M-Mr. Cooperton, Hi‚Äî" I stuttered, trying to maintain my stability. I felt a little out of balance.

"Hugo, please, call me Hugo."

He stuck out his hand, the tips of his mouth slightly rising, yet not enough to form a smile. Somehow, we were both at the same level of awkwardness.

"H-Hugo..." I trembled, my tiny paw grabbing the tip of his fingers, which were humongous by comparison, and slightly shaking it up and down. "What are you doing here?"

"Well, I'm..." Hugo placed his paws on his hips. "...I'm moving to LA!"

"You are..?"

"Yes, I, uh... I had an opportunity and I took it."

"An opportunity for what?"

"Well, uh, for my business," Hugo nodded his head, scratching the back of it. "Yeah, there's, um, there's an empty lot, just eastward along the coast of Santa Monica, and it seemed like a great business opportunity. We're building a hotel, you know how those tourists are..."

"That's... That's great! Congratulations!" I tried my best to look happy for him.

"Thanks, Sky. Can I call you that? Charlie likes to refer to you as that, so‚Äî"

"Oh, no, definitely, you can call me Sky. I prefer it, actually."

"Ah, ha, that's cool! Yeah!" The pauses in between sentences made me uncomfortable. Knowing him, he could break into a fit of rage at any moment. Each pause felt like the tick of a bomb. "So, um, how is Charlie, by the way? With his new job as... uh..."

"...Director of photography?"

"Yes, yes, that!"

"Yeah, it's going well! He likes it‚ÄîI mean‚Äîhe loves it."

"Ah, that's good, that's good... And, how are you two?"

"Us?"

"Yeah, how are you guys?"

"We're good. Yeah. We're alright."

"That's great. Yeah."

"Yeah."

"So, uh, I guess I'll see you around?"

"Yeah, totally."

"Um, if you and Charlie ever want to stop by my new place, here's the address," Hugo suggested, handing me a pre-written slip of paper as if he had planned it. "Come by anytime."

"Thanks, Mr. Cooper‚ÄîI mean, Hugo," I stammered, looking at the address on the paper.

"Alright," Hugo pressed his lips together and widened his eyes to try and lighten the mood as he took a few steps back. "Have fun, you guys."

"Of course."

"Oh, and tell Charlie that I'm here for him, if he ever needs me."

"Will do."

"See you, Sky."

"See you, Hugo."

I watched as Charlie's father turned around slowly and walked back into the crowd of the mall, disappearing on sight.

_He..._¬†

_He didn't seem all that bad..._

# 11. DADDY ISSUES

\~~~

## Skyler

I stood in front of the kitchen, taking in the sight of my little romantic dinner date that I had set up. Two plates were set atop red placemats on opposing sides of the small, stainless steel dining table; silverware organized accordingly, a few candles and a vase of flowers sitting in between. The plates were occupied with two large helpings of spaghetti, red tomato sauce drizzled over each plate, and three meatballs in a cluster, resting on the peak of each dish like a mountain. They were still steaming as I had just finished up. The sight was starving me, but unfortunately, I had to wait a little longer.

The girls were gone now, but earlier, before they left, Claire had helped me cook her famous spaghetti and meatballs, and Becca had helped set the table. It was good to have actual ingredients in the cupboards for consumption and not live off ramen noodles for the rest of our lives. It was a sign that I was getting better. And I felt better.

I pulled out my phone and looked at the time, reading 9:30. Charlie gets off of work at different times, but usually, if they're not doing a night shoot, it's 9 PM. The drive back home is an added half an hour. I put my phone back into my pocket and held my paws together, standing contently with my craft. I exhaled in relief, the wait for Charlie beginning.

The house was quiet without the laughter of Claire, the British pronunciation of Becca, the words of comfort from Charlie, or the voice of me, filling the empty spaces. I didn't like being alone, even if I did love the house.

After a few minutes of listening to the silence of the home slowly morph into a soft buzz in my ears, that strange hypnotic ambiance broke once I heard the jingle of metal keys and the smooth click of a door unlocking, just outside. I turned in place and smiled, excited to surprise him, looking through the open doorway that separated the kitchen and the living room. All the lights in the house were off, the kitchen candlelight being the only source.

The door opened and the familiar fluffy white husky entered, accidentally tripping in the dark and dropping his keys onto the floor. "Shit," He muttered to himself, reaching down and picking them back up. I giggled lightly, but not loud enough for him to hear. "Sky?" Charlie called, turning his body to the left, reaching for the light switch, only to land his eyes on me through the doorway.

"Hey," I gushed, my smile wide, slightly biting my tiny fangs down on my bottom lip.

Charlie, with his eyes still centered on me, put his briefcase and belongings down on the coffee table that stood next to the front door. A smile grew on his face as well, mixing with confusion and surprise once he had seen the stacked dining table.

"Sky..." Charlie gasped in disbelief, joining my right side and placing his arm around my waist. We both stared at the banquet, mesmerized. He let out a slight chuckle, in awe of the warm and romantic scenery that I had worked hard to perfect. It was something straight out of a rom-com.¬†

"How was work?" I asked in a flirtatious tone, brushing my paw against the side of his face. Charlie looked at me, closing his eyes as sunk into the feeling of my touch.

"You're amazing, you know that?" He cooed, enjoying my thoughtful caressing. I couldn't help but smile once again as he opened his eyes back up, taking in the sight of me. "I see you're finally getting back to dressing like a model," He complimented, eyeing my clothes, causing my face to go red. "God, you're so beautiful."

"You're beautiful, too."

"Hey, you don't get to say it back, you're the submissive one in this relationship."

"I didn't know there were rules to this stereotype."

Charlie burst with soft laughter, looking back at the dining table, the food that was calling our names.

"How did you manage this?"

"I have my ways," I told him, leaning up and kissing his cheek.

"Did Becca and Claire go shopping for you?" Charlie asked, looking back down at me.

"No, I went shopping with them," I answered.

That was when Charlie's amazed expression disappeared for a small moment.

I could already tell I was in for one of his overly-protective-boyfriend speeches.

"Sky... what did I say?" He spoke in a calm and caring manner, as not to disrupt the moment. He placed his paws on my hips and turned his body to face mine. "I don't want you going out when you're sick."¬†

My smile dropped a bit as well. I sighed deeply and left Charlie's side, pulling out one of the chairs from underneath the table for me to sit. "At least appreciate what I've done for you..."

"I appreciate it. I do," Charlie expressed, walking over to me as I sat down. "But you know how scared I am about your condition, Sky... I just want to protect you..."

"I feel fine, Charlie," I tried to convince him, looking up at the husky as he stood over me in the chair. "Better actually. Weirdly enough, my... cold went away."

"Are you sure?"

"Are you gonna stick me with a thermometer again or are you going to sit down and eat dinner with me?"

"I'm sorry."

I exhaled slowly through my nose, staring back down at the floor.

_Don't ruin tonight, Sky. Don't ruin it._

"It's okay, Charlie," I nodded my head, placing my paw upon his shoulder. "Let's just enjoy this. Claire and I worked hard."

"Ah, I knew it. This looks exactly like something Claire would cook."

I snickered in response, the tense atmosphere lightening again. Charlie went to the opposite side of the table and sat in the chair across from me, looking at his food with a craving.

"Wait, why do I have to sit here?" Charlie laughed as he shifted in his seat, getting a better angle.

"What do you mean?" I queried, crossing my arms and sitting with my back straight.

"I feel so distant from you in this seat," Charlie complained, using his hand to show how long the table was and how separated we were. "I want to sit right next to you."

"If you want to, go ahead, but I made it that way specifically," I rolled my eyes, picking up my fork and pointing the teeth at him.

Charlie sat up and picked up his chair by the rim in one hand and held the plate of spaghetti in the other. He then waddled his way over to my side of the dining table and pulled up a chair next to me. I couldn't help but chuckle as he did so.

"Much better," He grinned, leaning in and kissing me on my cheek.

We both utilized our silverware and began to dig in. Charlie started for a meatball as I twirled my fork in the pasta, collecting a good amount for my first bite. I fit the morsel of food into my mouth and slurped up the pasta‚Äîalmost a little too quickly, though, as one loose strand slapped me on my nose before disappearing through my lips. Charlie giggled as he chewed, picking up a napkin off of the table and dabbing the tip of my nose a few times, wiping off the sauce that the rogue spaghetti had left behind.

"You're the cutest," Charlie teased.

"How many times am I gonna have to say it, chew with your muzzle closed!" I pestered, touching my finger to his chin, closing his maw with a clack of his sharp teeth.

After a few eventful minutes of Charlie complimenting me and Claire's hard work as the ASMR-like sound of chewing filled the atmosphere, I shifted in my chair so that my entire body would face Charlie's. I had finished my meal before he did (I usually give myself a smaller serving since my stomach is pretty small, while on the other hand, Charlie devours food like the husky he is...) and was ready to break down the many things that had happened today.

"So, I have news," I began, slapping my paws onto my legs in order to get his attention.

Charlie nodded with a subtle grunt of approval and turned his body in the chair as I had just done, choking down his mouthful of food.

"I... have a business opportunity."

"Oh!" Charlie mumbled through a still-not-empty mouth, clapping his paws together and holding them in front of his face, his eyes widening in excitement. "Do tell," He spoke after he finally swallowed his food.

"So... Becca and Claire suggested that I start my own online business. For, like, art commissions and stuff." The more I talked about it, the more excited I was about the idea, and I was eager to hear feedback from my boyfriend. "I'd be able to have control over the things I produce, I'd be working for myself, and I'd be able to learn and grow my expertise."

At that moment, it looked as though Charlie had a spasm, his head jerking around excessively with thrill. He then threw his hands up as his jaw dropped into a wide smile, his eyes bulging with glee.

"SKY!" He exclaimed, lunging forward and pulling me into a deep and suffocating hug, swaying us left and right. "There we go!" He pulled back and held me by the shoulders, his gaze sweeping me off of my feet. "That's so perfect for you! I'm so happy!

"Are you just happy because I found a possible job opportunity and I won't have to live off of your earnings?" I joked sarcastically.

"You're getting out there, Sky. You're doing it," Charlie spoke in a low voice, almost like a whisper. He shook my body back and forth gently from the shoulders, causing me to blush and look down in embarrassment. I never knew how to handle appreciation or support, I was never one for gratitude. Especially from him. "You're doing it, sweetheart. I'm so proud."

"You say that all the time," I whispered back, trying to hold back a smile, but it was stitched onto my face. I loved the way he made me feel.

"It's because I'm proud of you, all the time," Charlie swooned, placing his paws on my cheeks, holding my face caringly as he stroked my whiskers with a tender sweetness.

I love him... I love him so much...

Everything felt so beautiful about the situation... but the issue had to be faced.¬†

I knew what it would do to Charlie, I knew what it would do to the moment, but I couldn't lie and forget about it. I couldn't keep a secret from him.

There's no way that I could lie to Charlie. _He couldn't lie to me either, right?_

I softly grabbed Charlie's paws and lowered them from my face, pushing them slowly away.

"Charlie... there's something I need to tell you."

As expected, Charlie's face then shifted to concern. It always did that whenever he noticed that something was up. He was that attentive to my needs.

_Here goes._

"Today, while I was shopping with Claire and Becca, I... I bumped into your father..."

Charlie's expression went blank, which is what scared me the most.¬†

Out of everything in his life, he was the most sensitive about Hugo. Usually, Charlie is a kindhearted, fun-loving, goofy, gentle, sweetheart of a husky... but just one mention of his father can turn him into a raging werewolf. The only times I've ever seen him _really_ angry was when Hugo was the point of interest. It shows how much he pains over that man.

"He... He's moving to LA. He said he had picked up a job, building a hotel near the Santa Monica pier. He... He gave me his new address..." I reached into my pocket and pulled out the slip of paper, holding it with two hands. I held it close to me, fearful that Charlie would try and take it and dispose of it somehow. But, Charlie just stared at it.

"It's not near here, don't worry... But, I... I feel like..." I cleared my throat, staring at the slip of paper, scared to look Charlie in the eyes. "In my honest opinion, I think he's trying to get closer to you..."

"Of course, he's trying," Charlie monotoned, his expression and attitude still difficult to discern. _Was he angry, disappointed, scared? I couldn't tell. He was just blank. And that was the most frightening emotion of them all._ "He's trying to get close to me. He wants to win me back. So he can use me again."

"Charlie, I don't think that's it‚Äî" I attempted, only to be cut off by a deep, rumbling, scary tone of voice.

"Sky, you can't..." Charlie grumbled, his eyes closed, his head shaking slowly. It almost sounded like a growl, a low roar. "You can't assume anything, you never knew him."

"You never let me _get_ to know him."

"There's a perfectly good reason for that."

"Charlie, he's your family."

"That man is not my family."

"He is your blood. And if that is so, he's my blood, too."

Charlie then shot his face up at mine.

"No, Skyler. There's no way. I can't possibly allow you to compare yourself to that... that... monster."

"Charlie, he wants to make amends."

"I gave him unlimited second chances. I have to stand my ground, Sky."

"He loves you!"

Charlie stared at me for what seemed to be the longest three seconds of my life.

He scoffed, breaking out into a small, passive-agressive chuckle. I suddenly felt my body shrivel in fear.

Hesitantly, he stood up from his chair and picked it up with his hands. He then slowly treaded back over to the other side of the table, making the disconnection between us even more obvious. He sat back down into the seat and rested his chin on his fists as the arms they were attached to stood firmly on the table. I sat there, lost, not knowing what to do or what to make of the situation.

"Charlie?" I asked, a little uncomfortable.

"Love isn't ownership. Love isn't abuse. Love isn't torture," Charlie muttered, looking at the table and not me. "And yet, he did all of those to me."

I went quiet, not knowing what to even say now.

Charlie could tell the position he had put me in.

He had always tried his best to never let me feel that way, and by the worry lines under his eyes, it was evident that he was regretful of the mood he had brought upon us.

"Sky..." Charlie sighed, shaking his head at a slow pace. "I don't know."

"What do you mean?"

"I don't know if I'll ever be able to allow myself to forgive him."

"He's your father, Charlie. He's trying to fix things. If you had made a mistake with me, wouldn't you strive to fix it?"

"I just can't handle him at this moment," Charlie continued, rubbing his eyes. "I need to be in a place of forgiveness to do that, and right now, I'm not there. I'm nowhere near that area. Maybe, one day I will be, but right now, I want nothing to do with him. I'd rather focus my attention and stress on something to actually be concerned about. Like, my career, this house, my job, and... you, Sky. You are ten times more deserving of my attention than _he_ is. So, right now, I'd rather just leave it behind me and forget about it. Just for now. I want to experience being an adult without the weight of my responsibility over him on my shoulders. I just want to experience a life without him, for once. That's why I ran away in the first place. I ran from home. I ran and found a safe haven in CIVA. I ran... right into you."

I could see his eyes water, but something was stopping me from believing it. I still felt myself becoming more persistent. I guess I presumed he was being unfair.

That he wasn't being grateful.

"So, you're saying that the only reason we met is because of your father?" I interrogated, my attitude becoming a little hostile. "If that's true, you have to make it up to him."

"Sky, I just said‚Äî"

"It doesn't have to be now. Like you said, one day, you'll be in that place of forgiveness. But, you have to promise me you will. One day, you'll forgive him. You have to promise me‚Äî"

"‚ÄîSky‚Äî"

"‚ÄîBecause one day, it might be too late. And you might lose him without being able to say goodbye. You might lose him and regret being able to apologize and right your wrongs." I hadn't noticed, but as usual, my cheeks were damp with tears. "Who knows, one day he might grow old and sick and spend every day in a bed. And even though he's suffering constantly, he'll keep pushing. He'll keep pushing to stay alive because he hopes that someday, anytime soon, he'll be able to see your face and know that you loved him back." My voice broke at that last sentence. I sniffled, squeezing my eyes shut, trying to control my breathing.

Charlie had then realized where the emotions were stemming from, immediately feeling remorse over everything he had said before.

"Oh, Sky..." Charlie whimpered, sitting up from his chair and running over to comfort me. He grabbed me by the shoulders and pointed me towards him, getting a long, stressed look at my guilt-ridden face. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," He whispered, pulling me into another hug, cradling my head in his chest.¬†

"No, no, this is my fault, I made it about me again, I'm sorry..." I mumbled into the warmth of his torso.

"No, I should've known about your father... I should've handled this differently..." Charlie huffed, disappointed in himself. "He'll be okay, Sky. I know he will."

I pulled back from his embrace, allowing myself to catch a breath. I wiped away my tears, hoping that the night wasn't ruined. I looked up at Charlie, seeing his saddened, red, tear-stained eyes.¬†

"Now we're both crying," I chuckled, providing some comic relief to the gloomy situation.

Charlie laughed in response, covering his eyes with his paws as he cleared them of their tears. He sighed in exhaustion and rested his paw on my head, ruffling his fingers in between the strands of my blue and pink fur. "Welcome back to being an adult, buttercup."

There's that word again. 'Adult'.

I still don't understand it, the meaning of the word.¬†

And, as I had said long before, I don't think I ever will.

"Just please, promise me you'll try," I compromised, grabbing his larger paw from my head and holding it tightly. "One day, you'll try and forgive him? Soon? Please? For me?"

"I will, Sky. I promise."

And that was all I needed to hear.

  

Little did I know that he would be making up to his promise sooner than I expected.

The evening eventually picked back up. We cleaned the table and washed the silverware and plates in the sink together. As the night went on, Charlie and I snuggled each other to sleep, the comfort wishing our burdens and strife away. The next day continued in it's usual fashion, Charlie went to work as I slaved over the painting, this time, with the added addition of researching how to start my own business. The house grew in decor as we constantly added more to make it feel like home. And 'home', as in, our bedroom at CIVA. Where everything began. Where we met, fell in love, spent our nights for four years straight. The next days that followed repeated the same process, and as the hectic month of April just nearly came to a close, Charlie had told me something I would never forget.

Something that would start a long line of events, like Dominos, one occurrence causing another.

He said he was ready. To talk to Hugo.

He was ready to talk to his father, after neglecting him for almost twenty-three years.

He wasn't sure if he'd be able to forgive him, but he was willing to try.

For me.

# 12. GOOD LUCK CHARLIE

\~~~

## Charlie

I sat in the passenger seat of the moving car, staring out of the window as things passed by, reminding me of the waning distance, notifying me of my impending doom. I rested my chin on my fist, which was positioned on the edge of the car door. We were in a more local area of California, a small town just a few miles off from Santa Monica.

I turned my head over to Sky, who was in the driver's seat of my Mini Cooper, his paws on the wheel. His eyes kept darting back and forth from the road to his phone, standing on the dashboard, displaying Google Maps to help him find his way. I was the one who taught Skyler how to drive during our stay at CIVA. I was proud to know that he had gotten the hang of it, even if he didn't have his own car. He used to be so nervous at the wheel; just one press of the gas pedal and he'd jolt from the sudden movement.

After he had sensed my head turn, he spun his own head back over at me.

Through my facial expression, I told him what he already knew: _I'm scared._

He exhaled through his nose as we stopped at a red light. Sky took the moment to reach out and grab my paw, turning it over to put his own paw in it. He gave me a look that calmed my nerves. _God, just one glance at those beautiful pink eyes and I just melt inside..._

"I'm going to be there with you, the entire time," Sky assured, snapping me out of my daze. "I'm not gonna leave your side. Okay?" He looked back at the road as the green light flashed, careful not to steer us down the wrong path.

"Okay," I muttered, holding Skyler's paw with both of my hands.

"If it gets too much, just notify me and we'll leave."

"Okay," I mumbled once again, pulling Sky's paw up to my muzzle, giving it a tender kiss. Sky then grabbed onto my hand and pulled it towards his own mouth, kissing my paw back.

"We should have a safe word," Sky suggested, fondling my hand as he went back to focusing on the road.

"What do you mean?"

"Something we can drop into a conversation that only we understand. Like a signal."

I immediately found myself turning to the one word I've spoken the most times over the past few years.

"'Adorable'."

"N-no."

"'Kitten'."

"Something less cute and more serious."

It took me a minute to think. _A word or a phrase... Something serious that only we understood... not an inside joke or a sweet pet name, something solid. Something that represents the both of us._

"Ten-eighteen," I told him.

"What's that?"

"It's the address of our old apartment. Where we first met. Where we first fell in love."

Sky looked at me, a hint of nostalgia blended with melancholy tinting his gaze.

"I like that," He stated simply.

"Ten-eighteen," I repeated.

"Ten-eighteen," He repeated back.

I looked at his phone on the counter. It's still the same phone he got from his mother all those years ago. I tried to convince him to let me buy him a new one, considering how incredibly slow it was and the fact that there was a huge crack across the screen due to his clumsiness. Even then, he insisted that he was fine with the setbacks. He was never really one for technology and he only used his phone for necessary purposes. Yet, on the screen, the words were clearly visible. "One minute until destination arrived."

"Are you sure you want to do this?" I asked, searching amongst the passing buildings, trying to guess which one he lived in.

"He's your father, Charlie. We have to."

"No, I mean _you_. Do _you_ want to do this?" I spoke with a different tone of voice. "After everything that I said about him, it amazes me how open you are to this. Why are you doing this for me?"

"Because I would want the same to be done to me."

I sighed. I figured I would be doing that a lot today. "I'm still sorry about your father."

"It's okay, Charlie. Mom keeps in touch," Sky told me as he scanned his surroundings for parking. "He's doing fine. Better now, actually."

"And Cal?"

"Like you said, he's a strong kid. He's handling things his own way." Since it was a more reserved neighborhood, Sky had found a parking place to back up in. He shifted the car into reverse and twisted the wheel, turning his body to look out the back window. "...And he might be gay."

"Wait, what?"

"I'll explain later."

Before I knew it, the car was parked.

Sky took another deep breath and dropped his paws from the wheel, landing them on his knees. He turned back to me with another hopeful look in his eyes. "You ready?"

I nodded my head, unable to give a verbal response.

Sky opened the car door on his side and I did the same on mine. I exited out into the brisk, dewy environment; the air felt moist yet calming, the birds were chirping, and dead leaves danced across the sidewalk in small cliques. It was late in the afternoon, and since there was a two-day break from filming, I didn't need to be heading over to any film sets soon. Yesterday was my first day off, and Sky and I spent it together, lying in bed. We didn't move a finger all day. All we did was lie down and cuddle. He tried his best to relieve some of the stress of the showdown that could possibly take place today, but the fear still lingered inside of me.

I looked at the buildings on the block. It was obvious which one was his new place, there was a huge three-story modern building standing in the middle of the sidewalk. I made my way towards it, until I heard Skyler's voice behind me.

"Where are you going?" He called. I turned back to him and pointed up at the building as if it weren't obvious. "No, this way," Sky directed, motioning me with his arm. I didn't expect it, but I complied and followed. I looked back at the house, surprised he hadn't claimed it. There was a for-sale sign on the steps and everything.

After walking down the block in the opposite direction, we came upon the right side of an apartment complex that was about ten stories tall. The beige cement walls and trimmed bushes that surrounded the perimeter of the building made it seem like it was both luxurious and rundown at the same time. I followed Sky as we turned the corner of the sidewalk, bringing us to the front of the complex. We entered through sliding double doors into a pristine main lobby, a young woman wearing a suit and tie at the front.  

"Charlie Cooperton for Hugo Cooperton?" I told the woman, a little nervous. I never liked his name in my mouth. It left a terrible taste.

She picked up the telephone on the marble counter and dialed a number, placing the receiver end up to her ear and speaking subtly into the microphone. I watched as her finger twirled in the spiral cord delicately. Sky placed his paw around my waist, rubbing his fluffy little fingers back and forth against my side.

"Floor 4, room 432," The woman instructed.

Sky and I found an elevator and entered it. I started to feel a little nauseous as we ascended in stories, but I didn't know if that was because of motion sickness or what was about to come. I assumed the latter.

We exited the elevator into dimly lit halls. It was a little noisy and unorganized. We could hear loud sounds coming from every apartment as we walked by each door, ranging from obnoxious voices, blasting music, and even sexual moaning. I placed my paws over Skyler's ears and raced ahead.

We eventually made it to room 432. We both stood before the white, wooden door, anxious of its contents. Sky kept squeezing my paw, an action he usually performed in uncomfortable or tense situations. And this definitely was one of them.

_This was happening._

I mean, I've talked to him in many circumstances before, but this time it felt different. I was trying to make amends. That's something I never imagined I'd be doing.

I looked down at Sky. "Stay by my side at all times. I don't want you near him."

He nodded at me, although he doubted that Hugo was that much of a threat. He didn't know who he was up against. That scared me. I can't let Hugo hurt him the way he hurt me. I can't. If only Sky knew that he was heading into the lion's den. I tried so hard to convince him not to go, but he put up a good fight. He made a pretty compelling argument, saying he will _not_ be forced to stay home again. I couldn't hold it against him.

I turned towards the door and lifted my paw. I knocked three, short and simple, times.

"Good luck, Charlie," Sky wished under his breath.

It was all I needed to hear.

The door had opened with haste, revealing my father in the cold light of day. I felt my body stiffen as a chill ran down my spine. The sight of him always had that effect on me.

Before he had spoken a word, time seemed to stand still for me as I analyzed him. It's been a minute since I saw him last. _Well, it was like a week, but to me, it still felt pretty long._

It was obvious that he had frantically prepared the moment he had gotten the call that I was on my way up. He pulled together a somewhat presentable outfit that could've made a reasonable impression. It was the same outfit he wore to my graduation, his plaid flannel and jeans. It was like he wanted to make himself look the most approachable. Fancy and sophisticated clothing would've been overwhelming and a little pretentious. Casual and laid-back clothing would've been uncomfortable and off-putting. He was no short of both, but instead, he went for the middle ground. Deciding to go in between the two categories and wear the most millennial clothing I have ever seen was a dedicated choice.

He had also shaved recently. His fur was trimmed and cut to charm, while his hair was a little messy, most likely the result of bedhead. He had a few lines under his eyes, showing that he probably hasn't been getting sleep recently. _Was it because he knew that I'd be coming?_

"Charlie and Skyler," He spoke aloud, taking the sights of us in. His voice was deep and bruting as usual. It always sounded like a cross between Dermot Mulroney and Hugh Jackman in my personal opinion. "I never thought I'd see the day where you two would be in front of me, together." I tried my best not to roll my eyes.

"It's good to see you again, Hugo," Skyler greeted, smiling. I just kept staring intimidatingly at the older husky.

Hugo smiled back at Sky. I could tell that he enjoyed Skyler's aura much more than mine.

"Come on in, boys, please," Hugo gestured as he disappeared into the apartment. Sky clutched my paw and lured me in, though I was reluctant.

It was nicer than I expected. The apartment had enough space to hold a living room, a dining room, and a kitchen, all in one area, even if it was separated by a divider that was as tall as a fence. To the left, there was a hallway that led to other doors and rooms, presumably a bedroom, or a bathroom, or an office. In the main room, a couch sat to the right, a TV mounted on the opposing wall. That wall attached to the divider between the living room and the kitchen, but they weren't fully separate, as there were two entrances on either side of the divider that led to the dining area. I walked through one of those entrances, finding a small kitchen: a fridge, a counter, cabinets, the usual. Right next to the kitchen, a small, circular dining table sat in the free space of the room. Hugo motioned for us to sit at it.

I pulled up a chair for Sky and took a seat myself. Hugo did the same, sitting across from us. Even though the table distanced us from my father, it was still too close for comfort. "How have you boys been?" He tried to strike up a conversation, exhaling swiftly.

"We've been doing pretty well," Sky spoke for the two of us. "It's been about a week since we moved in together and it's been hectic, but we've survived," Sky added a little chuckle at the end of his sentence, glancing at me out of the corner of his eyes.

"Remind me, how long have you two been together?" Hugo interrogated.

"Well, we, uh..." Sky doubled down on his thoughts. "It's been on and off mostly, but overall, four years?"

"Four years? Wow, have you two tied the knot yet?"

"Dad," I growled in a low voice.

"I don't mean sex‚ÄîWell, if you have, that's totally fine‚ÄîI meant, like, marriage or‚Äî"  

"Dad!" I increased in volume. Not a yell, but enough to show my annoyance.

"C-Charlie, it's okay," Sky fretted, caressing my shoulder frantically to calm me down before I got worse. Something about being in the presence of Hugo makes me so eager to snap. "We, uh, we haven't thought about it. Let's talk about something else."

"Sorry, um," Hugo shook his head, standing up from the table.

I looked around the place as he headed into the kitchen, in search of something. He opened the cabinets and acquired two glasses.

"Dad, how are you gonna handle owning two different places at once? In different states?" I wondered aloud.

"Oh, I'm selling the old house," Hugo answered my question, heading to the fridge. My eyebrows furrowed, a little shocked and confused. "Do you guys want anything?"

"Wait, you're selling the house?"

"Yeah. Why?"

"To live here?"

"Well, obviously, not here. I'll find a real place eventually. I'm in the middle of moving out of the old house." He informed me as he pulled out both a pitcher and a carton of milk from the fridge. He poured water into one glass, milk in the other.

"But you're selling the childhood house?"

"What? You never liked it, so why are you getting upset?"

"I'm not‚Äî"

Sky touched my arm and patted it gently, easing my temper to just a spark. Sky was like my own physical chill pill. "I'm, just... a little caught off guard."

"How come?" Hugo wondered, walking over the dining table, setting down the glass of water in front of me, the milk in front of Sky.

"I don't know, I..." I was at a loss for words. Sky awkward took a sip of his beverage. "We... grew up there‚ÄîI did, I mean."

"And yet, you were so passionate in leaving." Hugo's responses irritated me more and more.

"I wanted to get away from you, not the house," I stated, truthfully and shamelessly. Sky squeezed my wrist.

"Charlie, can we please go at least one minute without fighting?"

I scoffed, opening my mouth to say more, until I realized the promise I had made to Skyler. I looked down at him. By the way Skyler gazed at me, it seemed he agreed with what Hugo had said.

"I'm sorry," I murmured, grabbing the glass of water and taking a sip. I suddenly felt compelled to talk about things I hadn't been open about in years. "It's, just... so much happened there..."

I thought back to that dream sequence I had a while ago.

"One of my happiest memories took place on the street outside of that house... I was riding a bike for the first time, Mom was trying to help, and you watched as I fell into the grass of another neighbor's lawn and smiled..."

I could tell Sky was growing more and more concerned. He was beginning to hear a side of me that I never revealed to him. Never.

"Mom loved that house. She loved it. Before she ran away, I mean." Every time I mentioned Mom in front of Hugo, he hid his face in what seemed to be regret and shame. He never liked to talk about her. "Mom always wanted to move to LA. That's where she was going before the plane crash, right?"

"Charlie, let's change the subject..." Hugo spoke in what seemed to be a whisper.

"I moved here thinking, I don't know, maybe I'd find a part of her here."

"Wait, what?" Sky piped up, adjusting the way he sat in his chair. I glanced at him, noticing his confused and staggered expression. I began to regret admitting that last thing, but I was so caught up in the moment. I always got like this in front of Hugo. "You didn't tell me that."

"I..."

"You moved here for your mother?"

"I... I didn't want you to know," I confessed, the atmosphere growing tense.

"Why not?" He pressed, leaning in. "You told me, like, years ago, that you wanted to move to LA to start your career."

"Well, yes, I did, I wanted to, but... I don't know... I also hoped that... maybe, I'd feel closer to her."

Sky began to feel overwhelmed, I could see in it the way his eyes cowered in worry. He was easy to read when you've known the feline for four years of intimacy. To me, it wasn't that big of a deal, but to Sky, everything was important. I had just unleashed a new aspect of myself to him, and it was a lot to handle at once.

"Charlie, why didn't you tell me?" Sky urged, placing both of his paws on my arm. I began to feel a little out of sorts. "You never talk to me about your mother."

"For a good reason."

"I'm your boyfriend, I should know," Sky spoke in a tone that made it seem like it was common knowledge. The strain inside of me was rising, causing me to commit actions without thinking.

"You don't need to know everything about my life, Sky."

"I want to," Sky reasoned in opposition. "I want to be supportive, I want to be helpful!"

"You already are, I just don't feel comfortable talking about my family."

"Well, shouldn't we work through these issues together?"

"It's not _your_ family."

"You told me that I _was_ a part of your family, doesn't that make them my family, too?"

"Maybe it's not your place!"

"What?"

"Sky, you always do this," I grunted, clenching my fist. Sky began to hesitate, growing quieter.

"What do you mean?" Sky wondered, suddenly taken aback.

"You try and meddle in my personal life all because you think you're a part of my family. You're not."  
  
  

"W-what..?" Sky mumbled, taken by a tragic surprise.

With his tone of voice, I could hear the moment his heart shattered.  
  
  

I regretted everything immediately.

_That wasn't what I meant. It came out wrong._

"Sky, that's not what I meant‚Äî"

"Okay, guys, let's not do this here," Hugo interrupted, cutting the tension.

I watched as Skyler's eyes slowly watered.

Sky wasn't holding my hand anymore. They were resting on his own lap as he looked at the floor, saddened and abashed.  

If we were alone, he'd be having a panic attack by now. Instead, in the presence of my father, he wiped his tears before they fell and collected himself, sniffling and taking a deep breath.

I was so ashamed of myself.

I wanted to comfort him, apologize, do anything...

Instead, I foolishly directed my sights at my father, glaring at him.

_This is his fault._

_He brings out the worst in me._

"Dad, I'm thinking we should go," I suggested, now heated.

"What? You two just got here," Hugo perplexed.

"And we never should've come." I sat up and grabbed Sky's paw. He was reluctant, yet he still held on. I helped him up and coaxed him away from the dining table.

"Guys, wait, please," Hugo pleaded as I carefully guided a devasted Skyler towards the door. "Let's figure this out together."

"You've done enough," I grumbled, grabbing the handle of the door and opening it.

"Me? I've done enough?" Hugo protested, suddenly ticked off once again.

_Here we go._

_Like he said, we can't last a minute without fighting._

I stopped in my tracks before storming out of the apartment. I let go of Skyler's paw and turned to Hugo, who stood behind us.

"Every time I'm with you, something goes wrong, is that not weird, Dad?" I provoked, standing firmly in front of him, taking slow steps towards my father. "Every single time."

"Charlie, please," I heard Skyler whisper, tugging my shirt delicately from behind. "Ten-eighteen."

"I'm trying, Charlie, but you can't use me as an excuse for your shitty behavior," Hugo huffed, pointing his finger directly at me. We were a few inches away from biting off each other's faces.

"I could never make amends with you," I began to chuckle with rage. "I don't know what the fuck I was thinking before."

"You could at least have the decency to say thank you!"

"What the fuck would I thank you for?"

"Raising you‚Äî"

"‚ÄîYou barely raised me!"

"Giving you life‚Äî"

"‚ÄîYou made that life a living hell!"

"Charlie!" I heard Skyler whimper from behind me.

"Well, at least say thank you for trying to change!" Hugo yelled, his voice close to maximum volume. His face began to go red. "'Cause I'm really trying, Charlie! I am! But every time I even get close to you, you push me away and insult me! You're the one who's not making this work, not me!" Every time he raised his voice, he pointed his finger at me repeatedly with domination and ferocity. "Sure, I made mistakes, and I feel so ashamed of them, but I gave you life, I gave you a bed to sleep in, I put food on the table, I provided for you, I RAISED you! I even paid for your FUCKING HOUSE!"  
  
  

His voice echoed in the void that became my mind.

Hugo's eyes were filled with anger, his chest puffing rapidly as his breathing seethed with fury.

"What did you say?" I asked, my speech now quiet and timid.

"I... I owned that house, Charlie," Hugo admitted, sighing deeply and regrettably. I felt my body relinquish into a sense of doom, as if I had dropped down fifteen stories of an imaginative building.

"You... You what?"

Hugo took a deep breath, prepared to unveil a variety of things.

"Before you graduated college, I looked for a place for you and Skyler. I found that house and bought it in its entirety, only to put it back up for sale for a much smaller price. Kiernan is a realtor, but she was also my assistant when you were in high school. I'm surprised you didn't recognize her when you saw her, she met you a few times before when she was just a teenager. I got her to email you about the house. I got her to show it to you and Skyler. I got her to sell it to you two for one-third of the actual price."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

"Because of me, you have a house."

I couldn't stand it.

My own eyes were welling up with tears.

"You're welcome, Charlie."  
  
  

"Sky, you should go," I spoke without facing the feline. My sights were centered on Hugo the entire time. "Wait in the car."

# 13. BORED

\~~~

## Charlie

I stormed out of the apartment complex, marching firmly down the sidewalk. I saw the car in the same place it was before, Skyler sitting in the driver's seat once again.

I strode angrily to the passenger car door and opened it, climbed inside, and slammed it closed behind me. Sky looked at me, concerned and afraid, as I leaned against the door with a moody disposition. I'm at my worst when I'm angry, and he knew it.

"Are you okay?" He questioned with a deadpan, emotionless tone of voice.

He was most likely angry with me. He had every right to be.

"Just drive," I muttered, rubbing my temples with my paw.

"What happened?"

"Please, Sky, I just want to get out of here," I exasperated, breathing heavily and wiping the sweat away from my forehead.

_I'm being such a jerk to him._

I expected him to yell or cry or unleash his anger on me in any way, but instead, he mumbled, "Okay," and started the car. He pulled out of the parking spot and exited onto the road.

I watched out the window as the complex disappeared from sight.

\~~~

After the silent and tense drive, it was much darker out. The sun was setting just beyond the horizon.

As Sky parked the car in the driveway of our house‚Äîor should I say Hugo's house‚ÄîI immediately threw open the car door and speed-walked up to the porch, taking out my keys and unlocking the front entrance. I then raced inside the dark house, illuminated mostly by the golden rays of the falling sun, rushing over to the kitchen. I hastily reached the sink and smacked the faucet handle, letting the tap run. The water poured into my hands as I splashed it onto my face, in the midst of a meltdown. I controlled my breathing in order to save myself from hyperventilation, delving deeper into the sound of the water running for a prolonged sequence of time.

I heard the front door close behind me, as well as footsteps.

_He's probably going to sleep without me._

_It's probably for the best._

_I fucked up. Big time._

_I don't deserve him._

_He doesn't deserve me._

_He has every right to be angry with me._

_He has every right to be pissed._

_He has every right to fight me, shout at me, slap me in the face‚Äî_  
  
  

Abruptly and out of the blue, I felt two arms wrap around my torso, a loving embrace smothering me from behind.

I stared at the bottom of the sink, disoriented by the action.

_Was that even Skyler? Or just my mind playing tricks on me?_

I turned the faucet off and raised my head, almost blinded by the sunset's rays shining through the window above the sink. I attempted to turn around, yet the clutch of Skyler's arms was tight enough to restrict me to one place. But, of course, I was the stronger one, and I managed to perform a 180¬∞, looking down at the cat who was holding onto me for dear life.

_I broke his heart, yet, here he was, holding onto me in my time of anguish._  

He turned his head up to me, revealing his big, beautiful pink eyes, troubled and haunted with fear. Respectively, I clasped onto him with my own arms, reaching them all the way around his backside to his hips, holding Sky close and delicately. He felt so fragile when I cradled him.

_All he wanted to do was care for me and protect me, and I insulted him._

_He didn't deserve that. He doesn't deserve the colossal mess that is Charlie Cooperton._

_I'm never letting him near my father again. I'm never letting him get involved with my family, ever again._

_That's a promise I'm making to myself._

I began to kiss the top of his head repeatedly, pressing the tip of my nose to his as our foreheads collided.

"I'm sorry, Skyler," I whispered. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry..."

I kept mumbling that same phrase over and over as I held onto him, afraid that I could lose the only solid thing in my life. My eyes began to well up with even more tears as I squeezed his body even tighter by the second.

"It's okay, Charlie," Skyler whispered back. "I forgive you. I forgive you."

I couldn't stop apologizing. I couldn't.

I just kept saying it and saying it, over and over again until it lost its meaning.

I felt my body give way as I sunk down, pressing my back up against the counter.

"Charlie‚Äî" Skyler grunted, trying to maintain his hold on me as I slid down the side of the counter, but I was too heavy for him. I hit the floor as my tears burst out from my eyes, along with the painful sobs that ripped out of my soul.

I broke down, allowing myself to cry in front of Skyler. He almost never saw this side of me. He's seen rage, love, happiness, but almost never did he see sad. I've learned to suppress my emotions from all the times my father had beaten and hurt me. I've trained myself to keep it in. But this time, I had hurt Skyler, and I hadn't had trained for that.

My knees curled up, shaping myself into a cradled-up ball. Skyler dropped to his knees as well, shifting towards me. "Charlie!" He exclaimed, watching as I pressed my paws to my face, covering it.

He reached his hands out, gently grasping my paws. Slowly and surely, he pulled them away from my face, revealing the tear-stained fur and red-tinted eyes. I couldn't let him see me like this. I tried my best to turn away and hide my depressed expression, but Sky wouldn't let me. He placed his own paws to my chin, caressing my fur softly.

"I forgive you, Charlie," Sky repeated, staring tenderly into my eyes.

I couldn't hold myself back anymore. I lunged forward and captured him into another embrace, my arms and chest suffocating him wholly. He hugged me back, his arms reaching from under my armpits and his paws hooking onto my shoulders.

I howled, I wailed, I sobbed, harshly and painfully, into his shoulder, soaking his t-shirt. "I shouldn't have said that, Sky," I announced in between sniffles. "You are my family, you are. You are my only family, ever. I didn't mean what I said, I just meant... I meant..."

"I know what you meant," Sky tried to assure me, but I couldn't let him push my explanation aside.

"No, no, I meant... I meant... You're my family, Sky, you are... But, Hugo is my _blood_ family... and _that_ one you're not a part of. I can't let you be his family, Sky... I just want to be in your family, only... Yours, not his. And that's why you're not my blood family, because there is no way you could ever be related to that man, that monster, that evil thing... No way."

"Charlie, he's not a monster," Sky continued. "You've had a terrible past, but he's trying to make it right, what's so difficult‚Äî"

"No, no, Sky, I can't!" I whimpered, digging my forehead into his shoulder, rubbing my face repeatedly into the cloth of his shirt.

"Why can't you, Charlie?" Sky asked.

"I owe it to my mom, I owe it to her, I..." I went quiet. I rocked back and forth timidly and in an anxious fret, Sky still brushing his paws up and down my back. "I owe it to my mom..."

"What do you mean, Charlie?"

I began to confess. I had never told Skyler about my mother, ever. I never even told him her name.

But, it was time I told Sky the truth.

"Long before my eighth birthday, she had been telling me that she wanted to get away from Hugo for a while... Seven-year-old me didn't understand why she wanted to leave so badly, and I never did find out... until years later, I discovered that she was being abused by him..." I heard Skyler sigh and shake his head, tightening his grip. "On my eighth birthday, she... Before she left, she gave me an ultimatum... Come with her to LA, or stay in that town with my father for the rest of my life... I didn't understand why she would ever do that, plan to leave and give me that choice... so I believed that she was the one at fault, not my father. My dad had known about her plan to escape for a while, but he didn't do anything about it, because he _knew_ that I would choose him over her. And I did. It was 1 AM. My mother had woken me up on the morning of my birthday. She told me to get my things and to come with her as she had a birthday surprise waiting for me. I watched as my mother lost hope, tugging my arm at the front door in the middle of the night... I stood still, refusing to leave Dad... I still remember her voice... She said to me, 'Please, Charlie, please', over and over... My dad had awoken to the sound of her pleading and ran to stop us... My mother, she had tears in her eyes... She didn't want to leave me... but my father, he had his hooks in me, and I never knew it... The last words I ever heard my mother utter to me, while crying uncontrollably, was, 'I'm sorry, Charlie.' She had let go of my arm. She ran from the house with her suitcase. My father chased after her. She raced over to the taxi and entered it before my father could grab her. The taxi pulled away and disappeared down the road... leaving me with my father. Forever."

"Charlie..." I heard Skyler gasp with sorrow.

"He was always evil... He was always a monster... and I owe it to my mother to never forgive him. Because if I had gone with her, I would've died. And I never would've met you, Sky. So, I owe it to her. I owe it to her."

My tears had dried up at that time. Skyler kept brushing his paw down the fur on my back, relaxing and easing my agony.

"My family is cursed, Skyler," I murmured, unable to pronounce words properly. "The Coopertons are cursed... Never to truly be happy... Never to find real love..."

Sky then grabbed onto my shoulders and held me back from the embrace, looking at me in the eyes. "I love you, Charlie."

"But I hurt you."

"And you won't do it again."

I closed my eyes and exhaled with distraught, sinking my head down.

"Tell me more about your mother, Charlie," Sky initiated, stroking the sides of my face.

"No, no," I shook my head, trying to break away from his touch. "I've said too much."

"Talk to me, Charlie," Sky reinforced. "I want to know about her."

"No, no, I don't want to talk about her, please," I mumbled constantly, my head shaking and jittering uncontrollably.

"What was her name?" Sky asked once more, touching me softly and caringly. I squinted my eyes and gaped my mouth open, unable to close it, allowing my face to be fondled lovingly by him.

"I don't want to, I don't want to, I just want to forget about it," I stumbled, ranting relentlessly under my breath like an insane person. "I don't want to think about it anymore, I don't want to think about her, I don't want to think‚Äî"

Suddenly, I felt my body perform actions subconsciously once again. Without warning, I shoved my muzzle into Skyler's, kissing him fiercely.

It was almost too strong for Skyler to handle, as I began to push weight onto him, causing us both to fall over onto the cold floor. Sky squeaked as we hit the ground, but I just kept kissing him. I kept kissing him, again and again. I wanted to get it out of my mind. Sky just allowed himself to be kissed as I let loose onto his lips. I didn't stray, I didn't hold back, I didn't slow down. I just kept kissing him. The more I kissed him, the more turned on I became, and the more turned on I became, the more I forgot about my mother and my father.

I fastened my arms around Skyler's torso, shoving them underneath his back. I then maneuvered onto my feet, standing up as I picked him up off the ground. Skyler yelped from the sudden motion, his head whipping forward, locking his legs around my waist. I continued to kiss him as I carried Skyler from the kitchen, through the hallway, and into the bedroom.

The bed was right where we had left it, and before we knew it, we had collapsed onto the mattress, luckily with no head injury this time.

I crawled on top of Skyler, planting my mouth all over him. Quiet moans of ecstasy escaped Skyler's throat as I proceeded to make out with his lips, moving my muzzle down underneath his chin, kissing his neck. Sky kept moaning, at a loss of breath, overcome by the amorous feelings that generated from the movements of our bodies. He tried to push his body up, only for my arms to thrust him back down into the bed. I grinded my body against his, breathing heavily and erotically. I continued to advance farther down, dragging my snout across his chest, past his stomach, touching his body with my paws for every inch I explored.

"Charlie..." Sky whimpered, yet I didn't know if it was good or bad.

I wanted to stop, just to make sure if Sky was okay, but my body wouldn't listen. It was so desperate to rid itself of the negative emotions that festered in my brain by feeding off of lust. It was hungry for intimacy.

I reached the belt loops of his jeans, clawing at the button and fly. I wanted to tear his pants off so badly and show my love for him in ways I've never shown it before.

But, Skyler began to freak.

"Charlie‚ÄîCHARLIE!" Sky shrieked, kicking his feet and shriveling up, retracting his legs and arms into his own makeshift cocoon.

I caught my breath, realizing what I had been doing.

I sighed, glad that he was able to snap me out of it, but Sky still stared at me with fright adorning his expression. I slowly backed away, raising my paws to show that I wasn't going to hurt him. I carefully rested back onto the mattress beside him, lying down on the left side of the bed. The right side was always reserved for Skyler. We hadn't designated a side for the two of us, but it just became an unspoken rule.

"I'm sorry, I..." Skyler stammered, facing me in the bed, clenching his fists with regret.

"It's okay, Sky," I told him, resting my head in the pillow. "You're still not ready for sex, and that's okay."

"You always say that," Sky whined, guilt building up in his tone of voice.

"Because I mean it, Sky, I don't ever want to force you to do anything you don't want to do." I always said that too, but again, I meant it.

"But, we've been together for _four years_!" Sky scrambled and laid on top of me, resting his paws on my chest. I placed my paws on his back in response. "Aren't you tired of me cowering away yet? Don't you... want it from me? Aren't you longing for it?"

"Of course, I want to, Sky, but I'm not going to take it from you with force."

"I'm trying, Charlie, I really am!" Sky attempted to convince me. "I've been trying for so long... I've been trying to prepare myself... But... I can't get turned on... I try to play along and be in the moment, but... I can't feel anything down there... It's, like, from my waist down, my body is disconnected to my brain. I can't feel anything, Charlie. I can't... These fucking meds..."

"Sky, you don't need to convince me, I know," I reassured him, nuzzling the fur on his face with my paws. I felt so sorry for him.

"But you wanted it, you've wanted this for so long‚Äî"

"And I'll wait even more if I have to. I love you, Sky, and just because you can't have sex with me doesn't mean I love you any less."

"I... I feel like I'm holding you back... like I'm trapping you..."

"You're not."

"But... that time we broke up a few years ago... the first thing you did was sleep with some girl‚Äî"

"‚ÄîSky, we promised that we wouldn't mention that. I was not in my right mind when that happened. I fucked up. You know that."

"Can I ask you a question?"

"Of course you can, Sky."

"It's a serious question. And you have to promise me that you'll answer truthfully, okay? Do you promise?"

"I promise, Sky."

"You have to swear on it, you can't lie just to make me feel better."

"I swear on my life, Skyler."

"Okay..." Sky took a deep breath and looked at me sincerely.

I began to feel nervous.

Skyler opened his mouth.  
  
  

"Are you getting bored of me?"  
  
  

"What..? Sky, how could I‚Äî"

"Answer the question."

"No, God, no, I could never get bored of you!"

"Are you sure? After all the breakdowns and the emotions and the crying and the constant straying away from‚Äî"

"That doesn't bore me‚Äî"

"It's the same thing with me, every single day, I'm delicate and I'm angry and a nuisance to you‚Äî"

"I am not bored of you, Sky."

Skyler stared me down.

"You are..."

"No, I'm not."

"You are."

"I'm not, Skyler!"

"You are," Sky laughed, brokenheartedly, as he sat up and dismounted me.

"Sky! I'm not!" I urged, sitting up after him and grabbing his wrists.

"You are!" Skyler snapped, smacking my hands away and removing himself from the bed. He stormed off into the hallway and disappeared from my sight.

"Skyler!" I shouted, jumping off the bed in pursuit of him.

I ran towards the hallway, chasing after him, only to see Skyler marching back into the room, carrying a heavy can of white paint and a blue tarp. I stopped in my tracks, staggered by confusion. I watched as he walked up to the semi-finished painting and threw the tarp over the floor, setting down the can of paint.

"Sky?" I called his name, only for him to ignore me and walk back into the art studio, emerging with paintbrushes, his palette, and a smock. He threw the apron on and tied the strings together, reaching for the can and removing the already pried-off lid.

He dipped the paintbrush into the can and started to blot it on his palette rhythmically, attracting the right amount of paint to apply to the mural.

I took a few steps back and sat on the edge of the bed, watching him paint the wall with the tiny touches of white. He dotted the image in certain places to add a sense of light refraction and illuminate what seemed to be a starry night.

"What is it supposed to be?" I questioned, examing the painting in full.

"Don't you know?" Sky monotoned, his paw dabbing the wall repeatedly in a skilled fashion.

I leaned in, taking a better look. I combined all the dots in my vision together to form an image in my head, clear enough to be identifiable.

"It's the view," I stated. "From the top of the rock. At CIVA."  
  
  

Sky sniffled, reduced to more tears.

He just kept painting the wall, even when he was silently bawling.

My heart began to ache for him.

I stood up from the bed and approached him slowly.

He began to breathe in and out rapidly, unable to control his emotions.

I carefully put my hands on the palette and the paintbrush, slowing his actions to a stop. Once he had given in, I gently took the items from him and set them down on the tarp.

More tears began to stream down Skyler's face, even if he wasn't audible with it.

I couldn't stand seeing him like that.

He put his arms on top of one another and hugged himself, not knowing what to do.

I didn't know what to do either.

I just stood there, providing him with the company I didn't think he needed.  
  
  

"Is this what it's like to be an adult?" Skyler had asked me.

"I don't know, Sky."

"It's not going to be easy, is it?"

"No, it's not."

"I don't want to continue like this."

"Me neither."

"But we're gonna have to, aren't we?"

"I think so."

"I guess this is adulthood, then."

"This is adulthood."

### ACT II**:** THE SEARCG FOR AN IDENTITY

\~~~

## Skyler

### MAY

"Alright!" Becca beamed, clapping and holding her hands together. "How does it look?"

Becca spun my laptop around on the coffee table in front of the couch on which she sat. She faced it towards me, sitting on the armchair that stood a few inches away from the couch, catching me off guard, in the middle of eating a bowl of cereal.

"Hm?" I mumbled, a mouth full of Fruit Loops and milk. I sat up and placed the empty bowl with only a tiny level of milk remaining on the coffee table, next to the laptop. I leaned in, staring at the screen. "Woah!" I exclaimed with a closed mouth.

"Told you I could make you a sick website," She bragged smugly, resting her chin on her fist with a suave demeanor.

I began to drag my two fingers across the trackpad, scrolling down on the page.

It was beautifully done. Becca had designed me an online business, using the knowledge she had gained after becoming a popular internet influencer and making her own website. There was a beautiful, pastel pink and baby blue watercolor theme that swept around the empty spaces of the website that surrounded the main information. There were graphics that made every text box and button look like a sticker or a cut-out from a craft journal, with ripped grid paper and segments of patterned tape. It was easy to navigate and rendered surprisingly well, with no glitches or uneven spacing that could confuse users. At the top of the page, stylized letters that were reminiscent of ransom note typography spelled out the name, 'Skyler Clawfield', along with tabs that could be clicked on to show more, reading, 'My Portfolio', 'Commission Info', and, 'How To Contact Me'.

"This is amazing!" I gawked after choking my food down.

"Told you. Give me a few days and I can whip up anything, lickety-split," Becca boasted, snapping her fingers together.

"Thank you, Becs," I whined, scrambling over to the couch to give her a giant hug. We both clasped our arms around each other and shoved the sides of our faces together in a smothering embrace. We had gotten so used to being this close to one another.

"Of course, Kit, you know I'm always gonna be here for you, if you ever need it," Becca assured me, holding me back by my shoulders. I smiled and grabbed ahold of her paws, removing them from my body.

"Hey, I wanted to ask," I began, gripping onto Becca's paws lightly. "How have you been, recently? With the, you know, living-in-a-van-and-trying-to-save-up-money-to-travel-and-stuff thing?"

"I've... been doing fine," Becca faltered, sucking in air through her teeth and retracting her arms back to her lap. "It's just been stressful, you know? The whole world piling up on me while you, Charlie, Claire, and Jonathan seem to have everything in order? It gets hard, doing all this and not having a partner to share it with."

"Oh, Becca," I sighed, brushing my paw against the side of her face. "I'm sure one day you'll find a girl that loves you for who you are... and maybe, who knows, you'll travel the world together..?"

"Ugh, I really hope so," Becca nodded. "That sounds like the life."

"And trust me, I don't have things in order. Not as much as you think. We all seem like we're doing fine with ourselves at first, but sooner or later, we'll just find ourselves in another hole. I've been a colossal mess these past few weeks, but I'm getting better. And I'm sure you will, too."

Becca released a heavy sigh of relief, extending her arms out and back around my body. "I love you, you know that?" She mumbled into my shoulder.

"I love you, too, Becca."

"It's getting late, I should go sometime soon," She notified, pushing back and stretching her limbs after a long day of hunching over a computer screen.

"Really?" I turned around and looked out of the wall of windows, finding a pitch-black sky. "Oh, wow, time really goes by so quick. You can always stay the night, your house isn't going anywhere," I chuckled, the joke going over Becca's head. "Literally, it's in our driveway."

"Oh, no, please, I don't want to take up any space from you and Charlie's den of romance," Becca snickered, teasing me. I blushed and shook it off, slapping her on the shoulder. "Seriously, you and Charlie are living the dream here. You're both so relaxed and laid-back... I don't know why, but, there's something so intensely intimate about what you two have. I've stopped by Claire and Jonathan's place, and yes, they are a happy couple, they have a beautiful house, but something just seems so... _off-putting_ about it. Like, _white-picket-fence_ off-putting."

"What do you mean?"

"When I'm with Claire by herself, she's free and silly and exactly how I remembered her, but ever since she got married, she always acts so Barbie-doll-ish when around Jonathan. It feels like they recreated the set of Wandavision. Something's off."

"I'll stop by sometime soon to see if they're okay."

Becca nodded her head once again, a little awkward. She then shook away her concerns as her face lit up, ready to change the subject at hand and mood overall. "So, you ready for your website to go live?"

"I want to wait for Charlie, he gets back from work at any time."

"Oi, that's my cue to leave, then," Becca jested, sitting straight up from the couch and gathering her things. I sat up after her and followed the wolf to the door. "So, make sure you're promoting your business on social media, Facebook, Instagram, you know the whole routine."

"I've never used social media before, so thanks for making the account for me, and, like, all of the sponsored posts," I expressed my gratitude as I opened the front door for her, a cool breeze making its way inside.

"Of course, babe, and if you ever need help with navigating the internet, you know who to call."

"Thank you. God, I'm such a grandparent, aren't I?"

"No, not a grandparent, just a sad, inexperienced, old-timey, retro-kitten." My smile drooped as my expression changed to offended. "I'm just kidding, love, come here."

The glee returned as Becca hugged me, pushing away the cold that had overstayed its welcome.

"Bye, Becs," I dismissed as the wolf let go of me, giving me a quick peck on the forehead. She waved and walked out onto the porch, disappearing into the night. I made sure she got into her van and drove off safely before closing the door.

Once she was out of sight and the door was shut, I let out a sigh of relief. A tiring day to say the least, but now I can gladly wait for the love of my life to return.

_Three weeks have passed._

Charlie and I have had a few more arguments since then, but we're in a much better place now. They've only ever really been arguments and never _actual_ fights. I don't think we've had the ability to fight each other ever since that really bad occurrence in the back of Amber's, four years ago. Charlie was considering putting the house back up for sale since he didn't want to live under a roof owned by his father. He had tried so desperately to escape it when he was younger, but he had somehow found himself right back where he had started. I convinced him not to, since it would be torture, financially and realistically, to our already incredibly busy schedules. So, we decided to keep the house.

Charlie has been filming nonstop for the past few weeks, but thankfully, the shoot has neared an end... _we hope._ Apparently, some footage went missing in the process of being exported to the post-production crew, and they've been frantically searching their files nonstop. If they can't find it, then that's one more week tacked onto the shoot, delaying the scheduled premiere. On the other hand, I went through with the business opportunity. It was everything I wanted in a job, I couldn't pass it up. So, I enlisted the help of Becca to make it possible.

I walked back over to the couch and sat in Becca's place, turning the computer back around to face me. I clicked on the tab that read 'My Portfolio' and looked through the various pasted images of my work. Charlie had taken photos of every piece of art I had made with his photography skills and sent them to Becca, who edited them into the website. Charlie had even taken a photo of my CIVA mural. The 'Commission Info' tab listed strict rules about submissions and pricing options, as the 'How to Contact Me' tab had, well, my contact information.

I sat back and felt a wave of calm brush over me.

_Things were beginning to look up, finally._

_I can only hope it stays this way._  
  
  

"Skyleeerrrr!" I heard a voice whine with extreme exhaustion.

Frightened by the sudden cry, I jolted my head to the left to see that a weary Charlie had entered the house, surprisingly. I was too busy daydreaming to notice at first.

Groans of misery came from the husky as he slinked across the floor with a limp, dropping his briefcase and keys on the ground and shutting the door closed behind him. His head hung in‚Äîwhat seemed to be‚Äî_shame_ as his arms swayed back and forth.

"Hey, what's wrong?" I asked, instantly concerned, jumping off of the couch and running over to his aid.

Before I could even step foot in front of him, he snapped out of his miserable-fatigued act, lunging forward and scooping me up. He lifted me in the air with a laugh, spinning me around in circles with his arms locked onto my waist.

"Ah! Charlie, what the heck?" I yelped, becoming dizzy.

"Nothing's wrong, I just missed you," Charlie whispered, stopping in his tracks and lowering me from the air, landing his muzzle on mine.

"Ugh, you scared me, you dumb dog," I snickered in between kisses. As he made out with me, he slowly lowered me to the floor. We both parted our lips with a long and drawn-out breath and a gasp.

"I stopped by the store on my way home and got something awesome, you wanna see?" Charlie prompted with a smile, joining my side and wrapping his arm around my shoulder. We walked towards the couch together, Charlie seeming a little too excited.

"Sure," I moaned, rolling my eyes teasingly.

Charlie reached into the breast pocket of his polo and pulled out a small item, connected to a miniature chain and key loop. It took me a moment to analyze the silver object for what it was. That was when I noticed the little red button on the side of the tiny cylinder.

I stopped immediately and glared at Charlie, who was being a little too obvious.

"What?" He asked jokingly, a smile taking over his face.

"Don't do this, Charlie," I muttered, staring him down with a sense of irritation in my gaze.

"I don't understand what you're talking about," Charlie bantered, not able to keep in his maniacal laughter.

"Charlie, please," I spoke once again with just a hint of vexation.

"You wanna see what it does?"

"No."

"I think you do."

"I don't."

"Ready?"

"Charlie, STOP‚Äî"

Charlie pushed down the button as the laser pointer flicked on, projecting a red dot on the floor. I immediately faced away from it, staring Charlie in the eyes. I didn't take my sights off of him, no matter how hard I tried.

"Look at it, Sky."

"I'm not gonna look at it."

"You should, it's really cool."  

"I hate you."

"Seriously, you're missing out."

I could see it in Charlie's eyes, the reflection of the red glow on the floor, just slightly out of my vision. I felt a tick begin to surge inside of me. A small tingle in my veins. A chill running through my nerves. One part of me told me to enact my inner feline instincts while the other told me to stay still.

I held on as hard as I could, but eventually, the tick in my head broke all concentration, ditching the confrontational stance I was portraying. I gave in, unable to deny the haze of the red glow that was calling for me. My whole body jerked towards the red dot in a blink of an eye, almost giving me whiplash. I pranced down onto the wooden floor, my paws reaching out towards the light, only for it to disappear in my grasp.

I got ahold of myself, shaking my head from the stimuli. I was on all fours, awkwardly frozen above the floor. I could hear the sound of Charlie quietly sniggering.

I slowly stood back up onto my feet and turned about-face, staring at the husky who had tried his best to contain himself.

"You suck," I grumbled.

"I know, it's so cool, right?" Charlie said, shining the laser once again, humorously pointing it with his paw underneath his leg, as if it were a trick shot. The red dot hit the wall behind him, next to the front door.

Before I knew it, I was already at the other side of the room, blazing past Charlie in a matter of milliseconds. My instincts were acting up like a lion high on catnip. I had basically teleported, finding my paws cupping a certain section of the wall. I removed my paws to find nothing caught, much to my dismay.

"I think you missed it," Charlie goaded, shining the light back onto the wall beside me.

"I hate you so much."

"Look, it's right there, get it!"

"It's not gonna work on me," I said, while simultaneously reaching for the red dot with lightning-fast paws. Every time I went for it, Charlie guided the red dot a little farther, just out of my reach.

"Yeah, you're right, it totally doesn't work," Charlie spoke nonchalantly, watching as I kept reaching for the dot. "You think the laser is broken? I should probably bring it back into the shop and return it for another one." Charlie sat down on the couch, now guiding the red dot across the west wall, the one with doors and a fireplace.

"Why did I fall in love with you?" I whimpered, unable to stop myself.

"I was pretty handsome back then, I think," Charlie kept his teasing going, now directing it onto the floor in front of him, next to the coffee table.

My body whipped around like the Flash, finding myself right where the red dot was, clawing at its scarlet glow with claw-less paws. Charlie inched the red light closer to where he sat on the couch as I followed instinctively, resting the side of his head on his fist with a smirk on his face.

"So close, kitten." He then pointed the red light at his crotch, which immediately forced me to shoot my head straight up at the ceiling.

"Charlie!" I scowled, keeping my vision directly at the roof.

"I'm kidding, Sky," Charlie cajoled, laughing a bit. He removed himself from the couch and dropped down onto his knees, coming closer to me. "Here," he said, prompting me to look back down.

He was pointing the red light at his mouth.

I scoffed and rolled my eyes once more, knowing what he wanted. I leaned in and kissed him, giving Charlie his sweet satisfaction after a long day. Charlie tugged me in, wrapping his arms around my torso, holding the kiss for longer as he leaned back, pressing his backside against the bottom of the couch. We proceeded to kiss on the wooden floor, not bothering to take a seat.

In the middle of our make-out session, Charlie grunted in pain and backed away.

"What's wrong?" I questioned, only for Charlie to place his paws on my cheeks, carefully entering my mouth with his thumbs. He brushed those thumbs along the rim of my front teeth, feeling up a certain, reflected groove on both sides of my jaw.

"Your fangs are getting sharper," He admired, touching his thumbs to the tips of my two fangs.

"Is that bad?"

"No, it's adorable, you're like a little vampire. Smile for me."

I had done so, it was inevitable at that time. Charlie continued to giggle his heart out.

"Cute thing," He sighed, ruffling the fur on my forehead.

He leaned back in for another desirable kiss, which he got, but as he planted his mouth on mine, I reached into his closed paw and snatched the laser pointer away at the last second.

"I'm confiscating this," I ordered, shoving it into my back pocket and shifting my eyebrows.

"Dammit, I knew that'd happen. I can't believe I distracted myself."

"You're lucky I'm such a forgiving boyfriend."

Charlie brushed his fingers across my cheek, feeling the lines of my whiskers.

"How has your day been?"

"It was good, yours?"

"Still no news yet about the footage."

"You guys could wrap, right? If you eventually recover the footage, that is."

"Yeah, if it's found, then that's the whole movie done."

"It didn't feel that long to me."

"It's a short film, so it takes less time than usual," Charlie discussed, rubbing his paws up and down my legs. "At least it pays, though. How's your website? Is it live yet?"

"I waited for you!" I bubbled, sitting up from him and jumping back onto the couch, crossing my legs. Charlie sat up and joined me on the couch, looking at the lit screen of the computer. He analyzed the website with acute attention to detail.

"Wow, this looks really good!" Charlie gasped, leaning in and grabbing the computer, placing it on our legs in between the two of us. "Becca did all this? She's crazy talented."

"You ready to go live?" I enticed, bobbing up and down on the cushion, unable to contain my excitement.

"Let's do it," He smiled, grabbing my left paw.

I reached for the computer with my right hand, scrolling the mouse up to the editor bar on the top, landing on the bright orange 'publish' button. My paw hovered just above the trackpad, hesitant to press down.

Charlie sat there, waiting for me to click the button.

"I'm nervous," I winced, retracting my hand at the last moment.

"What are you nervous about?"

"The moment this website goes up, I'm committed. Fully."

"Yeah, Sky. That's how it is when you have to run your own business."

"I, just... I'm a tad worried..."  

"Oh my fucking god," Charlie scoffed, grabbing my paw and moving it back over to the trackpad. "Together, alright?"

"Alright," I took a deep breath and shook out my worries. "Together."

"Three, two..." Charlie counted down, slowly lowering our hands towards the trackpad. "One."

We both pressed down, making the screen go white with a buffering animation in the middle of the page. Charlie and I watched with anticipation as it spun around for several moments.

Finally, it reloaded and we got to see the page, live and in full for the first time.

The two of us stared at the website contently. It was published and ready for customers.

For some reason, I expected more from this situation. The website was published and I officially had my own business. I didn't think it would leave me this impatient.

"Huh. That was anti-climatic," I vacillated, sitting back on the couch.

"What did you expect, a thousand notifications of potential buyers blowing up your phone the moment you post a website no one has the link to?"

"I dunno what I was expecting," I muttered as Charlie grabbed me by the shoulders and began to lower me down. My head hit his lap as Charlie began to pet my body gently, soothing my doubts and strife.

"Well, a brand new internet page won't gain viewers immediately."

"That's what Becca's sponsored posts are for."

"Better give it a few hours. Let people find it overnight."

"Sounds good to me."

"Did you eat dinner yet?"

"All I had was a bowl of cereal."

"You're weird."

"I'm alive and choosing how to live."

"I'll order us your favorite dish to congratulate you on your work."

"You mean‚Äî"

"‚ÄîSushi, yes."

"Yes!" I cheered, clutching my paws into fists and jamming them into the air, my head still in his lap. Charlie laughed at my excitement and gazed down into my eyes lightheartedly, caressing the side of my face.

Things really were looking up for us.

\~~~

The next morning, I awoke to the familiar scent of Charlie, as my face was basically smushed into the fur of his bare chest. He has a distinct smell; not gross, not like a can of Febreeze, but something different. He smelled like home sometimes, and the scent comforted me every night as I had been sleeping with it for the past four years. Snuggling with Charlie is like entering your childhood bedroom, a place you grew and thrived in. Those walls have seen you age as the years gone by, just like how Charlie himself has watched me mature.

His right paw was wrapped around me, resting on my back, as his other paw lied on the pillow beside him. Once again, I was on top of him, one of my favorite sleeping positions with my husky boyfriend. I feel safe and protected, in a way, when he holds me as I lay upon his chest.

I wanted the moment to last forever, but soon, it would be ruined just like every other morning. Charlie would wake and tell me he has to get to work. I would beg for ten more minutes, he would compromise with five. Then, we'd spend half an hour in the bed, until Charlie suddenly becomes aware of the passing time, jumping straight out of the covers and directly into the shower.

This morning, however, it was different.

It started with the sound of my phone ringing on the bedside table. We both had the same ringtone, but I knew it was my phone since it came from the right side of the bed. Charlie's belongings usually lie on the left bedside table, mine on the right, since those seemed to be our designated margins of the bed. I didn't really like how we had conformed to a bed routine like a lame, boring married couple, but I'll take what I can get.

Charlie began to quietly groan as the phone chime got louder, tugging me back into the real world, leaving the realm of peaceful, quiet sleep. I pushed myself up from Charlie's chest and reached over to the right bedside table, attempting to grab my phone. Charlie and I were in the middle of the bed, and since it was a pretty large mattress, I had to practically crawl off of Charlie, even when he held onto me, physically begging for me to stay. _Well, well, well, how the turntables... That's not the correct phrase..._

I grasped the phone with the tips of my fingers, as far as they could reach, and carefully brought it over to me, cautious not to drop the phone onto the floor. Once it was near me, I grabbed it with my left hand and shifted back over to Charlie's chest. I looked at the number to find a random caller ID.

Charlie opened his eyes, shooting a glance at me that spoke, 'Who is it?'

I placed my finger up to my mouth, signaling him to be quiet, as I answered the phone and brought it up to my ear. I cleared my throat before saying a single word.

"This is Skyler Clawfield," I greeted, loud and clear like a talk show host.

Charlie watched intriguingly as the voice of a middle-aged woman on the other end spoke the word to me. He began to open his mouth to speak before I shoved my paw over his muzzle, trying to keep it cool over the phone. Charlie went quiet as I cleared my throat, trying my best to sound as awake as possible.

"Yes, that's correct," I responded.

...

"Oh, really?"

...

"Wow, thank you! That means so much to me!"

...

"Yes, of course! Just send me the information using the contact info, that, I'm sure you have already."

...

"Ah, alright!"

...

"Yes, haha! Thank you!"

...

"Definitely keep in contact! Of course!"

...

"Whenever sounds great! I'll see you then! Alright! Talk to you later!"

I took the phone away from my ear and pressed the red button, hanging up the line.

I looked down at Charlie, removing my paw from his muzzle to see he had a slight smile on his face, an expression that expected an answer from me. I'm sure he already knew what had happened, but he wanted to hear me say it.

"Well?" He asked, looking up at me as he raised his paws in suspense.

"I've got a customer," I chuckled, collapsing my head onto Charlie's chest, flustered.

"Sky! I'm so happy for you!" Charlie cheered, grasping his paws onto my cheeks and shaking my head back and forth. "Come here, buttercup," He giggled, luring me close and kissing me to his heart's content.

I kissed back, using up every ounce of serotonin I had received from this moment.

"I knew you could do it," Charlie whispered, giving me an Eskimo kiss, nuzzling the tip of his snout against my tiny nose. "Talk to me, what's the job? What's the commission?"

"She‚Äîthe woman‚Äîdidn't say much, we'll be communicating about the job over email, the call was basically just to confirm that she's a buyer. But, all she really said was that she loved the painting on our wall, so she's willing to pay me to paint a mural for her church."

"Wait, like a whole mural?" Charlie's eyes widened, stunned.

"Yep."

"Not, like, digital art? Like, an actual mural?"

"Yessir."

"You're fucking incredible, you know that?"

"She's going to email me an address soon, but all I know is that it's not near here. I'll only be spending, like, a few days out of town."

"So, a long-distance relationship? I thought we said we wouldn't do that," Charlie joked, a grin swelling up on his face.

"Shut up," I scoffed, lightly slapping the side of his face.

"Whatever happens, I love you, Skyler, and I'm so fucking proud of you. I am."

"Thank you, Charlie. Really. I couldn't have done this, any of this, without you."

"The same goes to you, Skyler." I couldn't help but smile uncontrollably as Charlie stroked his fingers across my face tenderly. "Look at us, we're both in the workforce now."

"We'll both be making money."

"We'll be true adults."

"Things are really starting to look up for us."

"I couldn't agree more."

"I hope it stays that way."

"I'm sure it will."

"I'm sure, too."

**Charlie**

Sky and I trod down the sidewalk at dawn. There were two heavy duffel bags in my paws‚Äîbelieve me, paint cans unbelievably weigh a ton‚Äîand a suitcase and a foldable art set in Skyler's paws. The sun was just peeking above the horizon, breaking into the dark blue sky, glimmering off of the small houses that stood along the side of the hill we walked on, above the beach. It was about 7 AM and the morning breeze cooled our sweaty limbs as we tugged the items towards the nearest bus station. The quiet atmosphere made it feel like we shouldn't be out this early, as if we were on the run.¬†

We reached a bus station by the end of the sidewalk, an endless road ahead. It was a small building with a parking lot that had many entrances and exits for vehicles to drive through. We walked into the establishment through the front doors, finding a minimal space with many seats lined up throughout the room. It was mostly empty due to the early time, apart from a few travelers with luggage, asleep in the chairs, headphones in their ears. At the end of the room was a counter with a receptionist, multiple signs above, attached to the ceiling, reading scheduled departures and destinations. Sky placed his items on one of the seats next to me and made his way up to the counter as I stood by the luggage. He handed in a few bills and got a ticket in return, walking back over to me.

"Wanna take a seat outside?"

I nodded in response and we walked back to the doors, exiting the building. We made our way around to the parking lot, filled with many buses, and sat on one of the benches.

"You got everything you need?" I asked Skyler as he double-checked if he had all his belongings. Luggage, check, art equipment, check, phone and keys, check, wallet, check, ticket, check. Sky nodded his head and exhaled through his nose, lying back onto the bench.

"I'm kind of nervous," Sky told me as I sat back, mirroring him.

"Don't be. You'll be staying for, like, two days."

"You know that traveling alone has always made me anxious."

"You sure you don't want me to drive you?"

"You have work. And we only have one car." Sky leaned forward, resting his arms on his knees as his foot tapped repeatedly, waiting for the bus. "So, if they found the footage, today could be your last day, right?"

"Yup. We'll be done and everything will go over to post-production."

"I'm sorry I couldn't be there."

"Are you kidding? This is your first job. I'm more than happy for you."

"But, I never got to be your assistant, either. Hell, I never went to the filming location."

"I'll send the address to you and you can stop by if the shoot _does_ run overlong."

"Thanks, Charlie."

In the distance, we could see a lone bus on an empty road drive into view. I looked at the anxious cat and felt it was my duty to comfort him. I inched a little closer to Skyler on the bench and put my arm around him, warming him up in the chilly temperature. It's always freezing in the morning by the beach. "Hey, you okay?"

"Yeah, I... I can't believe I'm really doing this."

"Remember, it's only two days. Well, a day and a half if you think about it."

"I said that to you before, and when you got back, I was in the hospital."

"That was four years ago. This is different. Nothing will change. When you get back, I'll be here, waiting, with open arms."

The Greyhound pulled up to the station, the tires hissing as it slowed to a stop. The bus driver came out and opened a small compartment on the side of the bus. Sky and I stood up, using our strength to carry the luggage and paint equipment to the little compartment that held all carry-on items. Before Skyler had entered, I placed my paws on his shoulders.

"It's just a few towns over. You have a room at a comfy motel waiting for you."

"Will you survive without me?"

"I'm sure I'll find ways to busy myself."

Sky squinted his eyes as I smirked at him.

"Is that a joke about fappi‚Äî"

"‚ÄîOkay, on you go."

Using my paws, I pushed Skyler towards the entrance of the bus. He rolled his eyes and brushed off his shoulders, getting ready to board the large vehicle. He looked back at me before placing his foot on the first step. He waved with a small smile. I waved back with my right paw, a grin on my face, my left paw in my pocket. It was all the courage he needed.¬†

He walked up the steps and entered the Greyhound. The bus driver boarded after Sky and shut the doors behind him. It hissed once again and lurched forward, pushing on into the distance in the opposite direction it came.

\~~~

"I was thinking, instead of the 50mm, we could use a 28mm lens to really capture the entirety of the beach. I think 50mm would be too tight on Elena, it should show the landscape around her," I thought aloud, my bare feet sinking into the sand beneath me. "And should the camera pan to Elena or should she walk into shot?"

"Whatever you think is best."

"But, before you told me that you wanted a specific shot for this scene since it's the last shot of the short film and the most important."

"Before, yes, I did, but now, I trust that you'll handle it perfectly. You've got skill, Charlie. I'm glad I found you."

"Thank you, Mr. Yuvi."

"Deno."

"Right, sorry."

The blue tundra wolf then raised his trusty megaphone to his mouth, ready to direct orders into it, towards the many people that stood on the wide and lively beach. We've been filming at this location for the past month, a small beach house that was closely similar to me and Sky's house but more modern. Deno's entire psychological thriller took place in that house, which gave a sense of claustrophobia and tension to the film. It was about how isolation can screw with a person's mind and the script was incredibly mind-blowing. Usually, it would be terribly hot when we shot on location due to the California temperatures, but this time we were filming in the morning, so it was much more cooler. The gorgeous sunrise was still evident in the sky.¬†

It wasn't as crowded as it usually was for a Hollywood movie, but it was a budget film, so our crew was more compact. We had more freedom that way, if you thought about it, with multiple people handling multiple things at once. It allowed for easier control and more productivity. A shepherd would have more difficulty rounding a massive flock of sheep than rounding only a few sheep. Even then, it still looked pretty busy at first glance.

"Okay, good news, guys!" Deno spoke, his voice booming over the megaphone, grabbing everyone's attention. The actress Elena stood in the distance, turning her head as the hair and make-up artists tried to keep her still, applying blush to the areas where her fur was a little darker and messy. My first and second assistant cameras, Arlo and Oliver, walked up to my side as the gaffer, Tyler, and key grip, Joshua, looked up from the Steadicam as they tampered with it. "I just got a call from Miles, the footage was found."

I could hear a resounding sigh of relief shared by all of us together once we had heard those words.

"Music to my ears!" Tyler shouted, making us all laugh in response.

"So, yes, that means that today will be our last day," Deno continued, laughing off Tyler's comment. "I'll give a whole speech later, but yeah, this will officially be the last scene we will film. It's a short one, but still, bring your A-game, it's an important moment. Back to work. Let's do this, guys."

We all applauded and prepared to begin filming the last scene.¬†

_Thank god_, I thought in my mind, unable to brush the smile off of my face. _Now I have more time to spend with Skyler when he gets back._

"What's got you so cheery?" Deno asked, setting his megaphone down on his personal 'director' chair, planted into the sand, sitting beside other chairs with names and labels for their respective roles. Before the seats stood a viewfinder on a stand, displaying the camera feed.

"Oh, nothing," I said, shaking off his question.

"Well, quit standing around and operate that damn camera, DP!" Deno pressed jokingly.

"Alright, alright!" I chuckled, turning away from him and making my way over to the Steadicam. I operated the camera since, again, it was a budget film. Deno went over to Elena and began to give her directions.¬†

"So, what's the plan, boss?" Arlo, the deer, asked as I took the Steadicam rig from him, holding it with care and delicacy. It was massive and extremely heavy, but I had already gotten my workout from Skyler's paint cans, so I could handle it.

"Please, don't ever call me boss, just Charlie," I laughed, adjusting the knobs on the Steadicam to stabilize it. We shot the whole movie on film since it was more appealing to the eyes and felt very vintage and artistic. "Elena's going to walk into shot. The camera is going to be still," I told him, looking out onto the beach horizon, the waves crashing in the distance. "Where's the tripod?"

"Got it!" Oliver, the Dalmatian, called as he brought over a three-legged camera stand. He tossed down a blanket over the sand and rested the tripod on top of it.

"Thanks, Oliver," I said, placing the Steadicam rig onto the tripod and fastening the lever, locking it in, tight.

I signaled to Deno that everything was in place with a thumbs up. He nodded his head and continued to instruct Elena with what he wanted. She was an arctic fox and one-half of the minimized cast, the other character had been killed off earlier in the script so he had already wrapped. He let Elena rehearse the scene once and I watched as she moved behind the camera and then ran forward, kicking off her high heels and racing towards the water. Deno stopped her before she entered the waves as we didn't want her wedding dress costume to get wet, even if it was soaked in blood. Deno then clapped his paws together, happy with her performance.¬†

_Watch the film when it releases and everything will make sense._

"Alright, let's do this!" Deno yelled, running back to his seat. Everyone got into place, ready to start filming. It was an important scene to the plot, since Elena's character had finally broken free from her abusive husband's grasp, but just like every other scene we had filmed before, I had goosebumps when behind the camera. I looked through the viewfinder, angling the lens to the exact position I wanted it in. I pressed the red button on the top of the camera.

"Cameras rolling," I spoke.

"Sound speeding," Kelly, the boom operator, yelled out.

"Quiet on the set!" Deno shouted without his megaphone.

We were all prepared and ready.

"ACTION!"

\~~~

After washing my hands, I took out my phone and looked at my messaging app. My texts weren't delivering to Skyler, which struck me as odd. I shrugged it off and put my phone back into my pocket, opening the bathroom door and leaving, entering a long hallway. I walked back into the main dining area of the restaurant, returning to my table. The sounds of clinking and subtle conversation filled the area as I walked down the carpeted floor, passing by tables with candles and nicely dressed animals. The restaurant owners had pulled together two tables, forming them into one, in order to fit the entire film crew for our little celebratory lunch. Deno was at the end of the table, of course, he was the director, and I sat in the chair on the side, next to him. I could see that he was in the middle of a speech when I came back, and once he had noticed me, he grabbed me by the shoulder and put his arm around me.

"Right on cue!" He exclaimed, his smile wide. "And last, but not least, I would like to give my thanks to Charlie Cooperton. He gave his own eyes to the camera, allowing for a much deeper look into the film, which I admire." Everyone else at the table began to applaud as they had done for the other people mentioned in his speech. Oliver added a small, high-pitched whoop, extremely happy for me. I could tell that he looked up to me. I was doing what I loved and inspiring younger people as well, it was everything I wanted in a career.

I chuckled and nodded my head. "Thank you, Deno. But, most importantly," I grabbed my drink and held it in the air. "I feel like you deserve the most thanks, man. You put this whole production together and made a family of sorts with your work. You're such a kindhearted guy and I think we all should take a lesson or two from you. I see it in every person you interact with, whether it's talking or the sheer mention of you, you make everyone's day. You know nothing but kindness, dude, and some people would say that makes you soft, but trust me, you've helped so many people. We're on your side, Deno."  

Arlo, Oliver, Elena, Tyler, Joshua, Kelly, and everyone else clapped and cheered. When spread apart, our film team looked much smaller, but when put together and shoved into a fancy restaurant, we could be mistaken for a whole audience.

"Oh, stop it," Deno chuckled, flustered, warding me off to sit down with his paw. He grabbed his own glass and proposed a toast. "To the film."

We all did the same. "To the film!"

"And that, my friends, is a wrap."

Deno bowed teasingly, which made us all laugh as we applauded him. The tundra wolf sat down, allowing us all to dig into the lunch that we had ordered. I played with my plate of lasagna, twisting my fork around in the dish, yet, unable to take a bite. I took a sip of ice-cold water, hoping it would push me to eat, but nothing stirred.

"Hey, man, you good?" Deno asked, his voice low.

"Hm?"

"You're not eating."

"Oh, I'm..." I mumbled, trying to focus my thoughts. "I think I'm just anxious, my boyfriend isn't getting my texts."

"Skyler, right? You mentioned him before."

"Yeah. I just wanted to tell him I'm free because we've been wanting to spend more time together. We've been through a bit recently, but we're slowly getting back to a state of... 'normalcy'? I don't know the word."

"Ha, I know how that feels. I used to have a boyfriend, too, when I was in college, and I just kept worrying about our relationship all the time and stuff..."

"What happened?"

"Eh..." Deno shrugged. I could tell it wasn't something he wanted to talk about. "Tell me, what's been going on with you two?"

"Well, Sky and I moved here together, hoping for the best, but then I found out my father had moved here as well, trying to get close to me, using a job opportunity as an excuse. I don't have the best relationship with him, he gets me really angry at times and I would accidentally take it out on Sky. Mostly because he's been the one pushing me to make amends with him... and I love how much he cares about me and my family, I... just... don't want him involved."

"So... I mean, I don't know your relationship with your father so I can't be the best judge, but Sky's been your boyfriend for four years, right?"

"About, yeah."

"So, it's possible that he might be right in pushing you."

"You think so?" I asked, looking back down at the plate.

"I had a... friend... who lost his father suddenly and abruptly and... I could tell, there was so much he regretted not doing, not being able to have a real, final conversation with him before he left. He just felt incomplete after that. I wouldn't wish that on anyone else. I wouldn't wish that on you, Charlie."

I nodded my head, conflicted. Sky had basically given me this conversation before, relating it back to his own father, but Deno had related it back to someone who had actually lost his father.

"So, I think you should at least try and find a happy medium with your father. Before it's too late."

I didn't take another bite of my food until lunch was over.

\~~~

_He paid for half the house, he moved to try and get closer to me, maybe I do owe him a thank you?_  

Thoughts ran around my mind like gerbils in a cage as I sat in the driver's seat of my car, sitting in the parking lot of the restaurant. Everyone else had left and gone home, treating themselves to their well-deserved breaks. Lunch had ended a few minutes ago and I was ready to drive back to me and Skyler's place, but something was stopping me. I just kept thinking about what Deno had said.

_Maybe... I can find a happy medium._

_Hugo did say he was in the middle of moving out of the old house... Maybe..._

I pulled out my phone and opened Google Maps. I typed in my childhood address, reading that the distance from here to there was a three-hour drive. It was currently one in the afternoon.

_Sky wouldn't be with me this time._¬†

_He'll be gone for tonight and will be back tomorrow. That's enough time to sort things out. Or at least, try to._

_I can do this on my own._

_It's time I make my own decisions._

_It's time I handle things, myself._

I tapped on the 'go' button on Google Maps and set a destination for home. Not me and Skyler's home, my childhood home.

I started the car and pulled out of the driveway.  

_It's time I face my father, for once and for all._

# 16. COMISSION

\~~~

## Skyler

_Shoot, my phone lost reception._

Makes sense, I was passing by terrain at fifty miles per hour, my phone can't latch onto a new signal every second. Well, the newer phones can, but I couldn't care less. I like my old, broken, familiar phone that's constantly in cardiac arrest.

I pulled out my earphones and put the buds in my ears and plugged them into my phone, resuming my downloaded playlist of music. I rested my head against the glass window, watching the sunrise over the small layer of trees that whizzed by every millisecond.

I had been packing and hauling luggage this entire morning with Charlie. Now that I was alone in a quiet bus, the soft sound of the tires covering the tar road humming at a low pitch, I felt it was the right time to catch a break. I allowed myself to rest on the bus, falling asleep to the music that swept wonders into my head.

When I woke up, the bus driver was calling out to me. He had told me that we had reached our destination. I immediately snatched the earphones from my head and put them in my pocket. I jumped up from my seat, grabbed my foldable art set, and made my way down the aisle, heading for the exit.

"Thank you," I chuckled, a little awkward and embarrassed. The man tipped his hat and opened the doors for me.

I hopped my way down the large steps since they were pretty big for my size, landing on the concrete of the sidewalk outside. The bus driver exited the vehicle behind me and opened the compartment, heaving my luggage and paint down on the sidewalk for me as I looked around to see where I was.

I found myself in the middle of a secluded, suburban-meets-urban neighborhood, a town with city-like amenities, small shops and corner stores lined up down the street. Pedestrians were making their way about, strolling up and down the pavement and crosswalks, heading into stores, talking with acquaintances, and so on. Sacramento, California.

It was about lunchtime when I had woken up, and my stomach was gurgling as a result of a tiny breakfast and a long drive.

Luckily, I am meeting my buyer at a cafe. I wouldn't be eating a whole lunch, but I'd get something to tide me over. I'll order actual food tonight when I check into my motel room.

I turned around and waved to the bus driver, who had climbed back up the steps and sat back down in his seat. He nodded and closed the door, pulling off down the street.  

I opened my phone and looked at the screenshot I had taken of the email with the buyer. Her name was Autumn Wingrave. She was a middle-aged woman, around her 40s to 50s, a disciple, and a youth group director in her church.

I had to paint a mural for her church, which made me a little nervous. Everything that happened with my parents and their religion just put me on edge.

I made my way down the sidewalk to the coffee shop we had agreed to meet at, hoisting my luggage and the heavy duffel bag of paints along with me. It was almost too heavy for me, which forced me to drag the duffel bag of paint cans across the concrete, earning me a few weird looks by passing strangers. I put my back into it, tugging on the two straps, losing my breath.

"Skyler Clawfield?" I heard a woman's voice call from behind me.

I dropped the two straps and turned around, holding my paw up to block the sunshine that was blinding me from sight.¬†

I guessed that the woman in the yellow-sunflower-patterned dress, standing ahead of me, was Autumn. She was a canine with a thick, white coat of fluffy, poofy fur. I couldn't really distinguish her breed, she was like a poodle or an Eskimo dog.

Autumn paced quickly back over to me, grabbing one strap of the duffel bag as I held the other.

"Oh, no, you don't need to‚Äî"

"Nonsense, let me help you out," She offered, her smile giving off a warm aura.

We both pulled on the straps, lifting and holding the duffel bag between us.

"Jeez, this is heavy," She grunted with a chuckle, her voice a little strained. "If I would've known how heavy paint cans were, I would've told us to meet at the church."

"It's okay, I got it," I pressed, to which Autumn declined and kept lifting the other end's handle.

We hobbled down to the cafe as the weight of the duffel bag seemed to grow lighter. The cafe was at the corner of the block and was lined with large brick walls and arcs towards the main front doors. Letters above the building read "New Helvetia" and some customers were sitting at tables on the outside. Autumn and I entered, finding a modest and roomy coffee shop. Nothing could compare to Amber's, though. _Well, except for the long title, maybe. The shop probably doesn't have the added slogan of "Sacramento's Best Coffee and Tea"._

Autumn and I took a seat at one of the circle-shaped coffee tables, lying down the duffel bag on the floor beside it with a heavy sigh of relief. I placed my luggage and art set right next to it.

"Hi, how are you?" Autumn began to laugh as we had forgotten to introduce ourselves, sticking her paw out as she gasped for air. I took it and shook it.

"I'm good, how are you doing?" I returned with a smile, trying to be as polite as possible. I wanted to make a good impression. This was my first job.

"Good as well!" Her voice was smooth like honey and her demeanor was very calming. "Thank you so much for doing this, Skyler. I appreciate it."

"No problem, just trying to make a living, I guess," I forcefully exhaled through my nose. "How did you find me, if you mind me asking?"

"Oh!" Autumn chimed, pulling back memories as if she were excited to share things with others. "I was browsing around for artists that did commissions and I found your social media profile. I was attracted to one of your paintings, it was a portrait of a husky. It reminded me of family members, so it caught my eye. I then looked at your website and found your portfolio. You're incredibly talented, Skyler."

"Thank you, ma'am," I blushed, unable to take compliments with a straight face.

"Please, just call me Autumn. It's my favorite season, actually! From the variety of artwork you made, I'm guessing you've done a ton of commissions before? Is this your first one in person?"

"This is my first commission... ever, actually."

Autumn's jaw dropped. "Really? I would've thought thousands of buyers had picked you up already! I was expecting to be placed on a waitlist!" She giggled. I nodded my head, at a loss of words. I couldn't stop smiling. "Well, I'm glad to be your first customer!"

"I'm glad, too."

"Now, question, do you attend church?"

I felt the atmosphere grow a little tense. I hated being asked questions like this, but I had to be truthful in order to get through.

"Oh, uh, I used to. But, when I became an adult I decided not to really get involved anymore. It wasn't exactly my place and I didn't really see myself going to it in the future, so I left." There was also the factor of my parents, but I decided to keep that one to myself. I noticed that Autumn had been looking at me with a bit of concern. "I'm sorry if that, like, offends you or anything‚Äî"

"‚ÄîOh, pfft, don't worry," Autumn cut the tension, putting my stress at ease. "It's my job to ask and invite people to my congregation. Plenty of people have turned me down. I won't force anything upon you. But, may I ask just one question? How come you didn't see yourself attending church in the future?"

"Well... I've always believed that, um, well, LGBTQ members weren't accepted. And I know that times have changed and churches are more accepting these days, it's, just, I can't really feel comfortable with it. I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize, it's okay, Skyler," She shook her head, sympathy showing in her gaze. She touched my arm slightly and pulled back, careful not to frighten me. "As a matter of fact, you're job is going to be painting a mural that celebrates acceptance and all sorts of LGBTQ members. Our youth group has had a few in recent years, so we're trying to make our congregation members feel more comfortable and safe, so I thought this would help."

"That's a really sweet thing to do, Autumn."

"Well, love thy neighbor, right?" She giggled, making me giggle as well. She leaned over the counter and reached into her handbag, pulling out a folder. She opened it and set down various slips of paper displaying ideas for the mural. They were a bunch of clich√©, yet, motivational symbols and sayings with tie-dye rainbow colors that portrayed acceptance and love. "So, here are some of my thoughts‚Äî"

"‚ÄîHey, uh, before we start discussing, is it okay if I order something to eat?"

\~~~

After about an hour of sharing ideas and getting a full picture in my head, we left the coffee shop and hauled the duffel bag down the lovely, naturalistic streets of Sacramento. This town was beautifully bohemian and aesthetically tasteful. Once we had gotten into the house terrain, I was able to look at all the pretty suburban homes along Apricot Avenue. I counted all the building numbers, _171, 172, 173,_ admiring how each house had a different style and unique way of displaying its address and features. It was a safe and tranquil neighborhood, one that felt like such a breeze compared to the busy streets of LA.

We then passed an art museum on the way to the church. On the walls outside, many paintings and pictures were used to advertise the museum and lure in visitors, like posters outside of a movie theater.¬†

Before we had made it off the block, I suddenly found Autumn frozen in her tracks, gazing deeply into one of the paintings. The last one on the side of the building. I walked up to her side, looking at it as well, wondering why she was so infatuated with it.¬†

It was an abstract painting of a mother and son, riding a bicycle. The son was attempting to steer as the mother pushed the bike from behind, carefully guiding her child down a busy park street with kids holding red balloons and ice cream in their paws. It was like what Charlie had said about photography, a moment trapped in time. This moment was blissful, joyous, and exuded childhood innocence.¬†

"I look at this painting every time I walk home from church," Autumn spoke under her breath, leaning in towards me.

"It's beautiful," I swooned with a light tone of voice.

"It's my favorite painting in the whole wide world. It feels like... Like a..."

"A moment trapped in time?"

"Yes, that." She pointed at me with a hint of cheeriness while still keeping a calm disposition.

I liked Autumn. She was sweet. Kindhearted. Similar to me, she admired certain, specific aspects that she saw in art. I could get used to her being around.

We then found ourselves near a Christian education establishment. I didn't even notice this was the church since it looked exactly like a suburban high school.¬†

Autumn guided me across the street to the main entrance, unlocking it with her keys. She began to catch me up on the history of the church and that it used to be a regular, everyday school, but was shut down due to a decimated budget. Her congregation picked it up and bought it, and they've used it ever since. Today wasn't a Sunday, so it was empty for now.

We headed down the vacant, unoccupied hallways, doorways on each side of me, leading to classrooms and study halls. There were also many colorful and decorative bulletin boards and posters outside of every classroom, except for one. Autumn escorted me towards a large, blank wall made of painted cement, stretching what seemed to be ten meters, in-between two entrances to separate classrooms.

"Does it look like the picture?" Autumn joked as she reached for the nearest light switch, flicking on the fluorescent beams hanging above. It shed more light on the wall and helped me scope out my canvas.  

"This will do just fine," I agreed, placing my luggage and art set on the concrete floor.

"Awesome! I trust you enough that you'll make something spectacular," She beamed, coming over to me and placing her paws on my shoulder. "And, remember, you don't have to feel afraid. You're accepted here, Skyler. I'm sure you know that."

I nodded my head hesitantly.

"Thank you, Autumn."

"Alright, so you're all set?"

"Yes, ma'am!"

"Autumn!"

"Sorry!"

"Make that money, cat," Autumn slapped me on the shoulder and left me to my own devices. "I'll be in my classroom if you need me. Room 421." I watched as she walked back down the school hallway and disappeared into one of the rooms.

Even though they were an accepting congregation, I always felt uncomfortable near religion. I kept telling myself it would be one job, over and done with by the next day. Yet, here I was, stuck in my own head.

_I've, just, always had doubts about my sexuality._

_And my gender identity._

_I still don't know whether I'm gay or... trans or... I have no clue what to think._

_Sexuality has always been a strange, gray area for me. E__ver since Charlie swept me up off of my feet,_¬†_I've just been trying to exist in that realm carefully. I didn't mind labels or terms or pronouns, I just ignored the idea of zeroing in on my identity. Sort of like how I ignored religion. It didn't matter to me. I just wanted to exist without their burdens. I like to see myself as undecided, unbiased. Not siding or favoring anything._¬†

_I'm just Sky. I don't need to have a purpose for my existence other than existing._

I took a deep breath and grabbed the zippers of the duffel bag, unzipping the opening. I reached in and unloaded my trusty blue tarp, throwing it down on the floor beneath the selected wall. I grabbed tape from the bag and applied it to the side of the tarp, sticking it to the base of the wall.

I pulled out my tape measurer and used my technique from before when I had painted Charlie's wall. I hooked the end of the strip on the corner of the doorway that led to one of the classrooms. I then extended the tape, walking back towards the other end of the wall, where the other classroom doorway was.

I looked at the measurement, memorizing it in my head.

Suddenly, the tape measurer jerked in my hands, which caused the hook at the end to fall off the side of the doorframe. It rapidly pulled back into the roll, the metal hook at the end colliding with one of my fingers that grasped the tape measurer.

"Ow!" I let out a suppressed shout, the tape measurer dropping to the floor.

I shook my paw back and forth a few times, the abrupt sting catching me by surprise. I looked at my ring finger, noticing a cut that had opened up from the impact. A small drop of blood began to stream from my finger, running slowly down the backside of my hand.

I winced and reached for the duffel bag, grabbing a roll of paper towels. I pressed them to the wound and stemmed the blood. I then pushed my towel-covered finger towards the ground since I needed my un-wounded hand to grab the box of band-aids in the duffel bag. Injuries like this have happened more than once, so I'm always prepared.

Using my teeth, I ripped open the wrapper and peeled off the tiny pieces of paper from the adhesive, taking my paw away from the bloody paper towel and wrapping the band-aid around my wound.

And just like that, the bleeding stopped.

"Whew," I sighed, catching my breath. I took long, excessive inhales and exhales, resting my paws on my knees and bending over from the relief. Blood has always scared me, but luckily, I was able to give myself first-aid all on my own.

Charlie was usually the one who had been my nurse.

I took a moment to collect myself before getting back to the grind. I couldn't waste a moment. I had to get this mural done.

I retrieved my sketchbook from the duffel bag and equipped a pencil. I held the notebook sideways and outlined a rectangle with the measurements. I then sketched a model for the mural, tracing thin lines and subtle designs. When I was content with the idea, I applied the pencil sketch to the wall, expanding the pencil lines to fit the canvas.

I grabbed my smock, stuck my head through the collar, and tied the strings behind my back tight.

Using two hands, I grabbed the handles of the paint cans and pulled them out, one by one. Red, Orange, Yellow, Blue, Green, White. Other colors, I could make from scratch by blending and mixing.

"Alright," I muttered to myself, reaching into my pocket and pulling my phone and earphones back out. I still didn't have cell service, but my downloaded playlist of music was always there waiting for me.

I put the earphones in my ears and resumed the queued music I had been listening to earlier. Music usually helps my process of creativity, so it got me in the mood. The wire connecting from the phone to my ears was a little annoying, though.

I used to have Bluetooth headphones, but I had given them to Cal.

I unzipped my art set and acquired a paintbrush and a palette, sticking my thumb through the hole and getting a good grip. I removed the lids from the already-opened paint cans and dipped my paintbrush into the red, adding it to one of the pockets on the palette. I then did that for the rest of the cans, leaving some pockets on the palette empty for mixing and blending.

I brought back the image of the mural from my head and touched the tip of the paintbrush to the red, obtaining a good amount on the bristles.

I walked up to the wall, resting my wrist on the surface.

The tip was just inches away from hitting the empty canvas.

I remembered the painting technique that I had used for several years prior.¬†

It succeeded every time.

  

_Just start a line and see where your heart takes it._

I pressed the paintbrush against the wall.

  

# 17. THE URN

\~~~

## Charlie

After a long three-hour drive, it was now five in the afternoon.

My sweaty palms rested on the steering wheel, exhausted and aching from constant grippings and turns.

I scanned the surroundings of the car, finding my old, childhood neighborhood, exactly how I had left it. I admired and reminisced every single detail of the town basked in sunlight, every stop sign, every telephone pole, every crack in the sidewalk.

I drove down the road, finding the familiar pathway that led to my childhood home. I took it, knowing each and every twist and bend of the street, surrounded by suburban households and trees planted in grassy plains. Every time I drove back into town during these past four years, I grew emotional, realizing how much my life had been wasted on me.

I wish I knew Skyler in high school. I wish I knew him as a kid. I wish I could've had a romance with him that lasted a lifetime.

I wish I could've been there to help him through his worst times.

I wish he could've been there to help me through my worst times.

Pulling up into the driveway of the house, I could see some boxes on the front porch, but not many. He might be at the beginning of his moving process because there's no way four boxes could fit the entirety of that house's contents.

I opened the door and got out, closing and locking the car doors behind me. My shoes sounded out light footsteps as they hit the stone pathway, leading up to the front door.

After walking up the steps, I stood on the front porch and took one last breath for good measure. I raised my fist and knocked it against the front double doors, shoving my paws back into my pockets as I waited for Hugo. I closed my eyes and focused on my thoughts.

_Don't explode. Don't freak out. Don't get angry._

_You can do this, Charlie._

_You can do this._

_Inhale, exhale._

I opened my eyes, ready for what was about to come.

The doors had opened. Hugo stood in the doorway, suddenly caught off guard by my appearance. His eyes widened. He froze and stumbled back a bit, taking in the view of me. He was wearing only a white shirt and cargo shorts. He obviously didn't prepare for this.

"Charlie, what..." He mumbled, placing his paw on his chin and rubbing it a little. "How did you know I'd be back here?"

"You said you were in the middle of moving," I told him, but not with an attitude or an intimidating glare. I just spoke to him normally.

Hugo kept staring at me, confused and taken aback by my presence.

"Need a hand?" I asked, conveying no emotions.

Hugo's stance of perplexion slowly changed to a subtle grin. He nodded his head and backed up into the house, allowing me to follow him inside.

I walked in and examined the interior of the house as Hugo stood to the side. There were half-filled boxes everywhere, stacked on top of one another. Some sheets were thrown over furniture. Picture frames housing golden memories were taken off the walls. It was so strange to see twenty years of my life, packed up in one room altogether. It felt as though there was no point in my childhood.

"I'm going to need help clearing out my study today," Hugo hesitated, not knowing how to act around me. "Does that sound good?"

"Yeah," I agreed, willingly.

I walked into the dining room that led to the hallway, Hugo following close behind. We both made our way down the hall, coming up on the door that led to Hugo's study.

Over the years, things have changed about his office. It was less dark than I'd remembered and had more rays of light shining through the open windows. The atmosphere wasn't thick, or haunting, or nerve-wracking like it was before. The big, illustrious painting of him was gone from the wall and so was the fake bear head. All that was left was the furniture, the folders, the piles of documents, the rolls of blueprints, and the picture frames hung on the walls, displaying certificates and deeds. On the floor were three empty cardboard boxes varying in size and shape.

Hugo had instructed me on what to do, pointing and directing his finger to help me understand better. "So, the frames go in the smaller box. All my work and documents will be filed neatly into the medium-sized box, and the blueprints go in the long, vertical box. The furniture we're going to move out onto the lawn."

I nodded my head and consented, getting right to work. I began to remove the picture frames from the wall as Hugo organized his paperwork into tidy piles, carefully ordering them into the medium-sized box. We then both grabbed the rolls of blueprints and cartography maps and tied these blue silk ribbons around them to keep them fastened and in place. We dropped them into the long, pole-like box.

My father handed me heavy-duty, packing duct tape that was connected to a dispenser gun. I extended the clear adhesive and ripped it off on the tear mark. I folded in the edges of the cardboard boxes and applied the tape. Hugo then took the tape from me and told me to do it two times over, which made it more sturdy and secure. He showed me how to tape the boxes in a way that wouldn't rip or wrench.

Then, the packages were filled, sealed, and ready to be moved.

I picked up the heavy box of stacked picture frames in one arm and fit the blueprint box in the indent of my arm, opposite to my elbow. I carried them both out as Hugo handled the box of his files. We transported the items back through the house to the front doors, which were left open. We rested the boxes near the others on the porch and took the chance to catch our breaths.

Hugo placed his paw on my shoulder and nodded his head. I nodded back with a sigh of relief.

"Can I ask you a question?" Hugo brought up as we trod back through the house, finding the door to the study once more.

"What's up?" I asked as we entered the study, ready to move the furniture.

"Why do you always act so pessimistic towards me? Whenever I'm close to you, you always seem to blow up in a fit of rage," Hugo interrogated as he aimed for his large, leather chair. I settled for the seat on the other side of his desk, where recipients would sit.

"Uh..." I contemplated, my mind going blank. _I didn't feel like fighting him today. It wasn't the time for that. I was supposed to be turning over a new leaf. For myself. For Skyler._ I exhaled deeply, ready to share honesty. "There was so much that happened in the past... every time I saw you, I just couldn't help but think of all the bad that you committed. And it would, just, make me so angry that... that I wasted my life trying to please such a terrible influence."

"Charlie..."

"I know, dad. I know you're trying to change. But, of course, it's going to take me time to get used to a life where I'm not living in your shadow. I need to be my own person. For myself and for Skyler."

"I see," Hugo muttered, nodding his head. He walked behind the large leather chair and clasped his paws onto the sides. He then pushed it, using his strength and might, thrusting it around the desk and through the doorway on its wheels. Mine didn't have any wheels, so I had to lift the seat in the air.

I followed Hugo as he propelled his chair down the hall, the wooden seat still in my arms.

We went our usual route, back to the front doors through the house, and pulled the chairs down the front steps, moving them out onto the grassy lawn. We both took another break for air to flow through our stifled lungs.

"What do you like about him?" Hugo questioned. "I never really got to ask."

"Why are you asking?"

"You always try to keep him away from me, Charlie. I want to know him. He's been dating my son for over four years, of course, I'd want to know him."

"I keep him away for a reason. I don't want him involved in this relationship. It's ours and we have to deal with it on our own," I dismissed, turning away from him.

I walked back into the house, ready to move the next piece of furniture. Hugo followed closely behind, seemingly a little disappointed in himself. This was the first time we've talked honestly without arguing or raising our voices. It was strange, but, it wasn't terrible.

We both walked back into the study and aimed our sights at the large wooden desk. This would take a team effort.

"You get the front side, I'll get the back," I ordered, walking around the desk to get to the other end. Hugo reached his end and clutched his paws onto the underside of the table. I had done the same.

"Three, two, one," Hugo counted, cueing us to both to lift the desk on our own. It was definitely heavy, but we were both able to slowly lure it through the doorway of the study and down the hall.

"You want to know what I like about him? He's a good person, Skyler," I continued, grunting from the cumbersome weight of the desk in my arms. We slowly inched down the hallway, careful not to knock into anything. "All he is is good. There's nothing not good about him, there's not one bad bone in his body. All he knows is how to be good. A good person. A good friend. Just good."

Hugo made eye contact with me as we maneuvered into the dining room, tiptoeing around the dining table, careful not to cause a collision.

"I couldn't let someone so good cross paths with someone who had done so much bad throughout my life. I was just so protective over him that I didn't even think about his own well-being."

We reached the front doors once again and made it out onto the porch. We cautiously walked down the front steps and rested the desk on the grass, once again, taking a break to breathe.

"He's everything to me," I confessed, out of breath, gasping for air. "You took so much from me, dad. I couldn't let you take him, too."

Hugo hung his head down in shame.

I could see the guilt and remorse taking over his demeanor.

He had changed so much.

He had changed so much from that evil, manipulative monster I had grown accustomed to for so many years. He was different now.

He was just a husky.

_But, deep down, his past still festered inside of him._

"You hurt me. Not just me, others. You hurt my friends. You hurt my girlfriend. You hurt mom." I had never said these types of things to him with such a calm and collected tone. I was being genuine, not ill-tempered. "Skyler has been hurt and beaten by the world far too many times to count. He's fragile, dad. He's always on the edge. He's always one step closer to falling apart. I need to hold him together, because if I don't, I lose control, and I end up hurting him. I can't do that to Skyler, dad. I can't. He doesn't deserve it."

I left him on the lawn. He didn't respond, he didn't try to fight me. He was just quiet, lost, shameful.

I walked back up the steps with a weary limp, entering the house once again.  

I walked through the living room and reached the spiral staircase.

I hobbled up the stairs, the metal material clanging as I ascended from the ground floor.

At the top of the balcony stood another hallway, one that led to my bedroom.

But this time, I stopped in my tracks in the middle of the hall.

It was mostly empty, except for one thing. A small table to the right, holding my mother's urn.

It was sapphire blue, a marble-like pattern glazing the shiny, reflective surface. Every feature of the object drew me in. The narrowed neck above the rounded body and footed pedestal. The flattened lid on the top.

I felt more consumed by it than I've ever been before.

I found my paws reaching for it.

Never in my life did I touch that urn.

I was too scared to feel the weight of what was once my mother.

It was too horrific for me.

Yet, here I was, my paws suspended in the air.

They were inches from the vase. I couldn't stop them from touching it.

Before I knew it, they were resting on each side of the metallic, sleek-surfaced pot. The touch of the glass vase was cold and electrifying.

I gripped my paws even tighter around the urn.

I picked it up.

_It wasn't heavy at all._

I brought it to my chest, my arms closing around the sides of the vase. I hugged the urn, feeling the emptiness it brought me.

I thought that I'd feel something, anything, but it just felt lifeless. Dead and cold.

Only then did I notice that my eyes were beginning to water.  
  
  

"Charlie?" My father called from down the hallway. I hadn't had heard him follow me up the staircase.

I didn't turn to look at him. I just faced the wallpaper of the hallway above the small table, unable to move.

"Charlie, what are you doing with that?" He asked with a calm tone, trying his best not to frighten me. He tiptoed his way closer to me at a slow and steady pace.

"Why..." I muttered to myself, the word escaping the dry edges of my lips and the coarse tip of my tongue. "Why..."

"Why, what, Charlie?" Hugo was closer to me now.

I found my body turning to the right, my sight rotating towards my father.

"Why did you hurt her?" I heard my voice crumble like a slip of paper dropped into a puddle of water. It was soft, not even a whisper. It wasn't a yell. It wasn't a confrontation. It was barely even a question. It just came from me. I had no control over my words.

"Why did you hurt her, dad?"

"Charlie... please..." Hugo sighed with a hint of sadness in his expression.

He tried to approach me, taking small steps forward. I took small steps back, shaking my head. My breathing began to build up, rapid and restrained.

"Why did you hurt her?" My vocals were now high-pitched. Like a whine or a whimper. My body was trembling. A tear was streaming down my cheek, dampening my fur. "Why... did... you hurt her..?"

"Charlie, are you okay..?" Hugo worried under his breath, placing his paws against my arms as they cradled the urn. I didn't want to let go. I kept holding onto the vase, unable to loosen my grasp.

"You hurt her... You manipulated her... You made her miserable... Why, dad?"

_I wasn't trying to be intimidating._

_I wasn't trying to confront him._

_I was crying in front of my father._

_I hadn't done that in years._

_I was lost._

_I felt hopeless._

_All I wanted to do was cry._

"Why did you hurt her, dad?" I began to cry, tears falling from my eyes like drops of water pouring down from freshly frozen icicles.

Hugo then did something I didn't expect.

He closed in, wrapping his arms around me.

_He had hugged me._

I wanted to hug him back, but my arms were locked tight around the urn.

"I'm sorry, Charlie," He whispered. "I'm so sorry."

"You... You hurt her... You..."

I pressed my face into his shoulder.

Tears fell like waterfalls, staining his shirt.

_Why am I crying in front of him?_

_Why am I allowing him to cradle me?_

_Why am I like this?_

_What's wrong with me?_

_This isn't you, Charlie. This isn't who you are._  
  
  

_Or maybe, it always was. And you've suppressed it for so long._  
  
  

_You just need to let go._  
  
  

"Charlie, can you give it to me? Please?" Hugo asked politely, slithering his paws onto the vase.  
  
  

_You just need to stop hiding._  
  
  

"Let me take it," Hugo pleaded, brushing his hands across mine, trying to shake them loose from the firm hold they had over the urn. "Please, Charlie. Let go."  
  
  

_Just let go, Charlie._  
  
  

"Let go, son."  
  
  

_Let go._  
  
  

I felt the urn drop out of my hands.

The sound of glass shattering ringed in my ears.

I shut my eyes closed, unable to bear the horrors that I had just committed.

I felt my father's embrace pull away from me, stumbling back.

I stood there, my arms still held out in the position of where the urn used to be.

My eyes were closed. My fur was coated with tears.

I stood there, unable to open my eyes.

Unable to face what I had done.

Unable to look at my father.

Unable to do anything.  
  
  

Against my wishes, my eyelids cracked open, revealing slivers of sight, one inch at a time.

My blurry vision focused on my father, who was staring at the floor beneath me.

_I have to face what I've done._

_It's my fault. My responsibility._

_I need to see it for myself._  
  
  

I slowly tilted my head downwards, bracing myself for a truly horrific sight.

I expected a mess of dust and ash. Everywhere.

Broken shards of glass, covering the carpeted floor.  
  
  

What I saw was something I did not expect.

It took my eyes a few seconds to adjust to what was below me.  
  
  

The broken urn sat on the floor, shards everywhere.

But inside, there were no ashes.  
  
  

Several red envelopes laid sprawled out amongst the floor.

No writing, no address, no stamps, nothing.

Just pure, red envelopes.  
  
  

My face shifted from devastated to shocked. Then to concern. Then to fear. Then to nothing.

I didn't know what to think. Or what to understand. Or what to feel.  
  
  

I lowered to my knees.

I picked up one of the envelopes.

I turned it around and opened the flap, revealing a folded-up slip of paper inside.

I removed it from the envelope and unfolded it.

_It was a letter._

At the top of the page, the letter was addressed to 'Charlie and Hugo'.

The date read November, three years ago.

I read the scribbled-out words, written in flawless cursive.

**_Today, I took a walk in the park. I saw some happy families with their kids and thought of you two. The moment I got home, I wrote this letter. From time to time, I can't help but think of what we could've been. I can't help but imagine a scenario where we were perfect, the happy couple, the happy family. I would've given everything to you, Charlie. I would've done everything to help you, Hugo. We could've been so much more. I know it's been years, but I still can't help but think about it. I'm sorry if this was a little emotional, I just needed to tell you both. I know I won't get a response, but Charlie, if you read this, I'm sorry. I tried to be the best for you. I wish I could've given you more, but I failed. I'm sorry._**

A tear fell on the paper.

I dropped the letter and reached for another envelope.

I opened the flap and took out what seemed to be another letter.

At the top of the page, it read, 'To Charlie and Hugo'.

I dropped that letter and reached for another. I ripped opened the envelope and read the top of the page. 'To my dearest Charlie and Hugo'.  
  
  

"What are these, dad?" I spoke, a hint of a growl forming in my chest.

I looked up at him.

His eyes were red and sweat was dripping down his forehead.

"What are these, dad?" I asked again.

He didn't answer.

His face was full of regret and guilt.

"What is this?" I asked once more. "Dad, what is this?"

My voice became louder.  

"What is this, dad?"

My voice transformed into a yell.

It began to break and fall apart.

"DAD, WHAT IS THIS?!"

It was a shout now.

I was still on my knees.

I was still crying.

He was still silent.

"DAD!" I begged. "DAD! WHAT IS THIS?!"

He was quiet.

"WHAT ARE THESE DAD?!"

He was still quiet.  
  
  

In an instant, I reached for one of the shards of the broken urn.

I gripped it in my paw and pointed the sharp edge at my father's face.

I stood up and held it out, directing the blade at him.

"TELL ME! TELL ME WHAT THESE ARE!"

Hugo held his paws up, trying to block the shard from coming near him.

"Charlie... I know you're confused, but‚Äî"

"FUCKING TELL ME!" I screamed at the top of my lungs, marching forward with the shard still pointed directly at him.

"Charlie!" Hugo fretted, backing up hastily, his paws shaking violently. He tripped and stumbled backward, trying to avoid getting cut.

"TELL ME! TELL ME WHAT IT IS! TELL ME! TELL ME! TELL ME, DAD!" I kept shouting, over and over and over again. He didn't answer. "TELL ME!"

I kept closing in on him. Hugo had backed up into the fence of the balcony.

He had nowhere to go.

I approached him, dangerously and violently.

The shard was inches from his snout.

"FUCKING TELL ME WHAT IT IS!"

"OKAY!"

My hand was having a spasm, quivering and convulsing vigorously with the shard still held firmly in my grasp.

Hugo cleared his throat.

He took a deep breath.

Whatever he was about to say, it would be huge.

Massive.

Life-changing.  
  
  

"Your mother..." He whispered, his eyes shut and body wavering.  
  
  

"She didn't die in that plane crash."  
  
  

With tears streaming down my face, my hand clutched so tightly around the shard it began to make my paw bleed, I asked one more question.

"How did she die?"  
  
  

My father stared into my eyes, sullen regret and fear taken over his complexion.

"She didn't."  
  
  
  
  
  

"She's alive."

# 18. GIRLS BATHROOM ONLY

\~~~

## Skyler

_I wonder how Charlie's doing right now._

It was currently nine at night, and I was yawning profusely. My arms were weak and frail from stretching and maneuvering them all day. I was sitting in the bed of my sleazy motel room that I had bought, slurping lo mein noodles from the Chinese takeout restaurant I had ordered from. The room was small, but not too far from the church, so it was the best I could get. I could hear cars passing by outside, honking and blaring their horns, along with shouting voices beyond the walls of my own room. I felt uncomfortable, as always.  

I had been working on the mural for several hours, and the only thing that ran through my head was Charlie. I hated being away from him for this long. I could only complete half of the mural, the bottom layer. Tomorrow, I would complete the top layer and finish the mural in full.

I looked at my phone, staring blankly at Charlie's contact. I tapped the icon of my recent calls and found that I had tried to call him six times already in the past hour, but none of them were answered. I still had almost no cell service, which could be the issue. Only one bar. I sighed, shoving the noodles into my mouth as I tapped his name once more, calling him again.

I placed the phone up to my ear and listened to it ring for a solid minute.

"Hey, what's up?" I heard Charlie's voice speak over the phone.

"Charlie?" I answered, excited to hear his voice. I choked down my food and wiped my mouth with a napkin frantically. I didn't think he'd answer.

"Hello?" He questioned as if he couldn't hear me.

"Can you hear me?"

"Hello? Is anyone there?" He continued. I checked to see if I was on mute, which I wasn't.

"It's me, Sky. Can you hear my voi‚Äî"

"Haha, just kidding, it's a voicemail. I got you again, Skyler, didn't I? Leave a message."

I felt the excitement leave my body like a hole in a bottle of water.

I closed my eyes and sighed, hanging up the phone. I smacked the screen to my face a few times in shame. _He's had that same voicemail for three years now.¬†I can't believe I fell for that. Again. For, like, the hundredth time._

I dropped the phone on the mattress and picked up the box of lo mein. I chowed down even more, almost ramming the chopsticks down my throat. I picked up the remote on the bedside table and pressed the power button, flicking on the TV. I flipped through channels, finding something that interested me. That was when I found a channel playing Bob Ross painting tutorials. I sat back and relaxed, finding comfort in it. I had nothing else to do.

Well, I guess sleep was an option.¬†

But, without Charlie, I can never get to bed soundly.

\~~~

Somehow I did. It took a while, though.

I laid on the motel mattress with my face smushed into the cushions. My arms were wrapped around a large pillow with a certain size that could be compared to Charlie's torso. My earphones were in my head. I was listening to my sleeping playlist that consisted of soft, slow songs.

But, of course, my sleep had to be taken from me.

My phone rang with a loud alarm, surging through my headphones and straight into my ears. It frightened me, causing me to jump up in bed with a scream. I took a deep breath and gathered myself, sitting up straight with the blankets over my lower half. The room was dark and scary, the only source of light emitting from my phone as it vibrated. I grasped my phone and looked at the caller ID, reading Charlie's name.

He was calling me at one in the morning.

I immediately tapped the green call button and held it to my ear.

"Charlie?" I spoke, my voice a little shaky as I had just woken up. I rubbed my eyes with my fist.

"Hey," He responded.

He sounded blank and monotone. It struck me as odd.

"Hey, are you okay?" I asked with a hint of concern.

"How was your day?" He changed the subject, his tone still unexpressive and empty. It sounded like he didn't want to talk to me but was forcing himself to. "How was the first day of work?"

"It was good," I nodded my head, yet something felt off. "Yeah, it was great, actually."

"That's so good," His quiet and hoarse voice sighed with relief. "I'm so happy for you, Sky."

"How are you? Are you okay?"

"I'm fine, Sky. Just tired."

"Well, how did filming go? Did you wrap?"

Charlie went quiet for a moment.

"Sorry, my audio is breaking up, I'm losing connection."

"Huh?" I questioned. "But my audio is working just fine?"  

"I don't know, I'll have to talk to you tomorrow," He dismissed, causing me to feel disheartened. I was looking forward to having an hour-long talk with him like we usually did. "I'll see you later, okay, babe?"

"Yeah, o-okay‚Äî"

I heard a small click as the phone line went dead. He hung up.

_I was feeling a lot of strange emotions at the moment._

_First of all, he called me at one in the morning._

_Second of all, he seemed sad. His vocal expression was extremely worn out and drained of energy._

_Third of all, he changed the subject, like, twice._

_Fourth of all, I don't think his audio was breaking up. He sounded fine on my end._

_Lastly, he called me babe. He never does that. He knows I hate it._

I sighed and dropped my phone back onto the bedside table, resting my head back onto the pillow. I couldn't get the troubled feeling to go away.

_I'm probably just overthinking things. I seem to do that a lot and I've been trying to get better at controlling my emotions._¬†

_Just calm down, Skyler. Calm down._

I took a deep breath and squeezed my eyes shut, trying to fall back asleep.

But, somehow, my mind kept attacking me.

I couldn't stop it.

\~~~

I had made it through the night with only a few hours of sleep, but fortunately, it was enough to maintain my energy to paint for another several hours. I had checked out of the motel in the morning, since I wouldn't be going back to it, and left for the church. Autumn let me back inside and helped unload my painting equipment. I got straight back to work and didn't stray from the wall for the whole day. When it comes to art, I could get lost in a project for hours upon hours.

The mural was coming together nicely. Before I knew it, afternoon had rolled around and I was adding the finishing touches to the painting. There were blotches of dried acrylics all over my smock, my shirt underneath, and my fur. I looked at my messy paws and felt the need to wash them, but I was so close to being done, I couldn't stop now.

Using my palette, I dipped my brush in the white paint and touched my fingers to the bristles, pulling them back and releasing them. Microscopic white dots splattered over the mural, giving it texture and composure. I repeated the same action to various spaces of the mural, staining the fur on my fingertips white.

Once I was done adding the white dots to the last few places needed, I dropped the paintbrush onto the tarp and took a few steps back, taking in my work. Of course, it didn't turn out as expected, nothing ever does for an artist. But, I was proud of it.¬†

I tried to go for a more minimalistic style to the mural, adding modest shapes and colors to represent figures of people and flags. I had used a strictly pastel-based color theme throughout the mural for consistency and went without the usual black outlines to make it abstract. It was a simplistic, yet colorfully diverse piece. I was happy with what I had done.

I glanced at all the different sexualities that I had represented and colored. I must've painted about twenty different LGBTQ flags on the mural. I looked at the rainbow flag, the pink-purple-and-blue flag, the pink-_yellow_\-and-blue flag, and the pink-_white_\-and-blue flag.¬†

That last one had me staring at it for an elongated amount of time.¬†

It was always that flag that caught my eye whenever I looked at the whole array of LGBTQ flags.  

When I saw that flag, I felt lost. Conflicted.

  

_Who are you, Skyler?_

_Why can't you figure this out?_

  

I wiped my paws on the smock and reached into my pocket, pulling out my phone. The dried paint on my hands made everything I touched feel weird. I opened my phone, staring at Charlie's contact once again.

I've already called him, at least, ten times already.

_I should stop, I'm probably bothering him._

"I'm not paying you to stare at your phone!" I heard Autumn yell sarcastically from down the corridor. I rapidly turned my head at her, caught off guard. She was smiling and marching down towards me to see my work.

"I'm not!" I whined as she approached me, standing by my side and looking at the mural.

"Wow..." She gasped, taking in the view. Her mouth was wide open in awe as she placed her paws on her hips. She gently placed her paw on my arm. Autumn seemed really moved by it. "This is ten times better than anything I expected. It's, honestly, beautiful."

"Really?" I wondered, examining the mural, trying to see what she saw. For some reason, I can't detect the pride in my own work, I can only see what I can improve on.

"It's perfect, Skyler," She swooned with a hint of emotion. She looked at me with a face of gratitude. "Thank you. So much."

"Thanks for hiring me. I'm glad this was my first job," I chuckled, thinking of what else I probably could've been hired for and likely hated. I was lucky I got the assignment I did. "This place is amazing, honestly. I'd love to take my boyfriend here."

"Trust me, Sacramento is not as pretty as it seems."

"Really? It's so beautiful here."

"Don't judge a book by it's cover, hon. This congregation is the only truly good thing about it. I'm moving next month, so this painting is sort of like my small goodbye present to the church. I owe it to them. They took me in when I was struggling and on my own."

"I'm sure they'll love it."

"Let me get you your check and I'll send you on your way, alright?" Autumn told me, placing her paw on my shoulder before racing back down the hallway. I was so wrapped up in the mural that I forgot I was even getting paid for it.

"Yeah, totally," I took a deep breath, thankful that she was pleased with it. It was my first job and I had succeeded.¬†

I looked down at my messy paws and realized I had to wash them. "Um, I hate to ask, but where is the bathroom?"

"Oh, just down this hallway!" Autumn called out to me, pointing down a corridor to her left as she returned to her classroom.

"Thank you!" I called back, placing my palette on the tarp and untying the strings of my smock. I removed it from my torso and walked down the hallway, taking a turn into the corridor she pointed down.

At the end of the empty hallway, I could see a sign sticking out from the wall near the ceiling, reading "Restrooms". I made my way over to them.¬†

Under the sign, I found two doors next to each other, blue and pink labels adorning them. The blue one on the left read, "Boys Bathroom Only", and the pink one on the right read, "Girls Bathroom Only".

The choice was obvious.

I reached for the boys bathroom, but something stopped me.

  

My paw was against the handle of the door, yet I couldn't open it for some reason.

I was frozen.

Something wasn't letting me enter.

  

Without warning, I felt my head turn unconsciously to the right.

I looked at the sign "Girls Bathroom Only" for a few seconds or so.

Those seconds felt like hours.

Time seemed to slow down, if not stop completely.

I felt my hand lift from the bathroom door handle, moving over to the girls bathroom.

_What are you doing, Skyler?_

_Stop this._

I looked down the hall. No one was in sight.¬†

The school was vast and empty, apart from Autumn, who was still writing me my check.

I was alone. No one was watching me.

I set my sights on the bathroom door and placed my paw on the handle.

_Are you really doing this?_

I opened it, entering the female restroom.

I tiptoed across the tiled floor.¬†

I felt nervous and uneasy.¬†

_I knew I shouldn't be in here, but... something was telling me that I... belonged here..._

_Was it my subconscious? My mind? My anxiety and my fear?_

Something just drew me in, and here I was.

In the girls bathroom.

It was petite and surprisingly very organized. The walls were painted a dark green and had small decals of butterflies and flowers. You don't usually find a decorated bathroom, but this church seemed to really adore livening up the place, even if it was the restroom. There were three stalls to the left and many sinks and towel dispensers to the right. The windows in the wall ahead allowed for natural light to come through. It was completely silent and had a roomy echo, evident by the sound of the door shutting behind me.

I was inside. I was alone.

I made my way to the middle of the restroom.

I turned my head to the mirrors that stood above five individual sinks.

I saw my reflection in the mirror and stared at myself through the small smudges and scratches in the glass.

_Who even are you, Skyler?_

I shook my head, trying to rid the state of mind I was in. I walked up to the sink, lifting the handle to turn on the faucet. I drenched my painted paws in the stream, acquiring hand soap to scrub off the acrylics.

_What am I doing here?_¬†

_Why am I in here?_

I began to scrub my paws viciously, a sudden and overwhelming feeling of panic coming over me. I scrubbed harder as the soap bubbled and expanded into foam. The cut on my finger began to sting through the band-aid. Some drops of red fell into the sink and slid down the drain.

_What are you doing?_¬†_What are you doing here, Skyler?_

I washed off the soap and rinsed my paws free. The now clean and dampened fur of my paws reached the faucet handle again, shutting off the water.

I looked up at the mirror, locking my sights onto my reflection, once again.¬†

We made eye-contact.

I saw my face.¬†

My eyes, my nose, my mouth.¬†

My blue and pink fur.¬†

My whiskers, my ears.

My whole body.

My appearance.

_Who was I even looking at?_

I haven't focused on my reflection in so long. I see it a thousand times a day, but I never really focus on it.

The more I stared at my reflection, the more I saw behind it.

_I didn't even look like myself._

_Is this what people see when they look at me?_¬†

_Is this what Charlie sees?_

_I don't look like Skyler._

I watched a tear fall from my eye. I didn't even feel emotional. My eyes weren't even watering. I didn't even know where the teardrop came from.¬†

It just fell.

It streamed down my cheek, dripping off of my chin and collapsing into the sink.

I sniffled and wiped my face.

I mounted my paws on the edges of the sink and leaned over, still staring at myself.

"Who am I?" I asked under my shaky breath.

_Who am I?_

_Who is that feline staring back at me?_

_Who is Skyler Clawfield?_

_Is he even a male?_

_Or something else?_

## Charlie

_It was 7 AM. I woke up in my room._¬†

_The daylight was low and gray. The room was a little darker than usual. I sat up from my bed, yawning and stretching my limbs._

_I examined my surroundings, staring at all the picture frames and printed photos I had taken during high school, on the shelf to the left of my room. In front of me, stood my desk, with a computer, a few notebooks and toy figurines, and my trusty DSLR camera sitting atop of it. I used that camera for almost everything. I pulled the warm blankets off of me and sat up from the elevated bed frame, making my way towards the shelf._

_I looked at all the photos I had taken. Memories upon memories displayed on rolls of film, painted in velvety ink and shiny lamination._

_I adore photography. And film. They'll be my majors if I make it into college. I would love to make film and photography my official career if I really do graduate and get a degree in filmmaking. Maybe one day I'll direct a movie, who knows? I just hope I make it into the filmmaking business someday._

_I picked up a polaroid sitting against a picture frame of me and my mother. The polaroid was a photo of me and Cassie in New York. We broke up a few months ago, prior to her move out of town._¬†

_I was devastated, don't get me wrong. I loved Cassie. I still love her. But, it just didn't work out._¬†

_Maybe, one day, we'll get back together._¬†

_Or maybe... I'll meet someone new?_

_It doesn't matter, I graduate high school next week. I don't have time to focus on love and romance at the moment._

_After showering, brushing my teeth, and getting ready for the day, I grabbed my backpack and shoved all of my textbooks and notepads inside, zipping it closed. I dressed in my mandatory school uniform, adorning my navy blue blazer and pulling a tie around my neck. I could never learn how to wear a tie properly. I always had to search up videos on the internet to help tie it correctly._

_I would ask my father, but, I don't think he'd care. He'd probably just berate me for not being mature enough to do it on my own._

_I tied my shoes and headed for the kitchen. I grabbed a granola bar in the cupboard for breakfast since my father never cooked and made my way through the dining room, towards the front door._

_That was when I noticed the mail, sprawled out on the ground, lying before the front doors. They had been delivered through the letterbox in our door._¬†

_I quickly looked around for my father. When I was sure the coast was clear, I swiftly ducked down and scraped the mail together, skimming through each item, one by one. I searched for the envelope that would have the signature logo of the school I had applied to._

_A letter from my dad's business. Skip._

_A letter from the bank. Skip._

_A flat package containing paperwork from my dad's associates. Skip._

_A red envelope with no sender name or return address listed in the top left corner. Only our address was printed in the middle._

_It struck me as odd, but I've seen a few of these turn up in the mail for the past few years._¬†

_I couldn't care less, though. Skip._

  

_That was when my heart dropped._

_Once I had laid my eyes on the logo, my body went rigid._

_"Cloverland Institute of Visual Arts"._

_I felt my pulse stiffen as my heartbeat began to speed up._

_"Is that the mail?" I heard a groggy voice bellow from behind me._

_In a flash, I turned around to see my father in the least appealing way possible. He was a mess, his tank top had beer stains and cigarette burns, he was in his boxers and slippers, his face was dirty, and his fur was unkempt. He always looked like this in the morning. Soon, he'd clean himself up and make himself look like a multimillionaire in order to impress clients. If only they could see the real Hugo Cooperton._

_I held the stack of envelopes behind my back._

_"Yeah, do you want them?" I stalled, quickly tucking the letter from CIVA halfway into my pants, covering the other half with my blazer._

_"Give them here," He ordered, holding his hand out._

_I placed the stack of letters into his hands, knowing I had the one I wanted._

_He snatched them away with attitude and turned his back to me, going through each and every one of them._

_He stopped for a moment when he saw the red envelope. I didn't know why._

_"You okay, dad?" I asked._

_"I'm fine. Go to school."_

_My dad walked off without a second glance at me, towards the spiral staircase, leading up to the hallway that led to my room. The metal stairs creaked as he ascended each step, then disappearing into the hallway._

_I could hear the subtle sound of glass clinking together._

_He was probably caressing mom's urn again. I've caught him hugging that thing on several occasions as if she were still alive. It got creepy._

_The moment I knew he was gone for good, I eagerly stepped outside onto the front porch, closing the door behind me. Once I was finally alone, I tore open the envelope and retrieved the folded-up letter from CIVA inside._

_I held it to my chest and closed my eyes._

_I took a deep breath._

_This is my ticket out of here._

_Please, mom. Please tell me you granted my wish._

_I unfolded the letter and opened my eyes. I stared at the letter and skipped all of the unnecessary words, skimming through and scanning for the one sentence that really mattered. My heart raced as my eyes ran over each sentence, each word, each letter._

_That was when I saw it._

_"...you have been accepted into the Cloverland Institute of Visual Arts!"_

\~~~

I woke up in my empty childhood bedroom, having spent the night in the bed that had served me for almost twenty years. As always, it was drafty and abandoned, devoid of any life. I had slept on the floor with a blow-up mattress and a blanket from the living room couch.

I pulled the blanket off of me and headed for the door, exiting my room.

In the hallway, the carpet was swept clean of any remaining shards of glass that could cut our feet. I walked down the hall slowly with a limp, as I had slept on my legs in a funny position throughout the night. Once I had reached the balcony over the main hall, I could hear the faint sound of food sizzling on a pan and the crisp smell of bacon and eggs wafting from the kitchen. I journeyed down the spiral staircase, following my nose.

Entering the dining room, I walked in on my father setting down two plates of breakfast, beside each other, on the long dining table. A few eggs cooked sunny-side-up and two strips of bacon sat on each plate, hot and fresh. My father looked up at me once he had taken his eyes off of the meals, standing back as if he were caught.

"Hungry?" He shrugged, sitting down in his seat at the end of the table.

After careful hesitation, I nodded. I took the seat next to my father on the side of the table, acquiring a fork and knife, digging into the food.

I wasn't acting angry or petty or even passive-aggressive. I just acted normal, as if nothing happened.

The sound of chewing and the clinking of silverware against the glass plates filled the vast silence of the dining room. It went on like this for a few minutes.

_It was the calm before the storm. I knew there would be arguing today. I would just have to enjoy the peace and quiet before everything went to shit._  

When I was halfway through my eggs and done with one strip of bacon, my father cleared his throat. He was already finished with his breakfast.

"Do you want me to recap it for you again? Or was five times enough last night?"

"One more time. I need to get the story straight in my head, now that my mind's clearer after a good night's rest," I spoke sarcastically. I couldn't sleep one wink last night.

"Okay," He agreed under his breath, nodding his head subtly. He shifted in his chair and wiped his mouth with a napkin. I braced myself for it, even though I had heard the alibi several times already.¬†

"Your mother wrote to us, once every month, after she fled. She regretting leaving you, but she did not want to come back for me. So, she decided to send letters, directed to the both of us, in order to check in on how we were doing. Well, not really 'check in', more like brief us about her own life. We could never respond or send any letters back since the ones she sent were anonymous. The name and address were withheld. She didn't want me to find her. So, I never told you about them. I was so angry, yet fearful that you would read the letters and want to join her, so I told you that she died to keep you away from looking for her. I didn't want to lose you."

I scoffed quietly, yet remained silent in order to hear more of the story.

_He's so full of shit._

"I know how that sounds, Charlie. I didn't want to give you up. Because..." He halted, the sense of regret and shame overcoming him. I could tell he didn't want to admit what he was about to say. "Well, I wanted to use you... But, I've changed, Charlie. You have to understand that. You're not a pawn on my gameboard, no, you're my son. I should've understood that earlier. I don't want to use you for my own benefit anymore. I can't do that. You are your own person and a growing adult, and I've changed. I'm not that evil person anymore."

"You never know, dad," I whispered, stabbing the food with my fork.

"I mean it, Charlie."

"Oh, and did you _mean_ that mom was dead, too?"

"Charlie... I was a terrible man back then‚Äî"

"How come you never told me? How come I had to figure it out for myself? If you really wanted to change, how come you never confessed when you were on the path to 'getting better'?"

"I regretted lying to you, Charlie, I really did. But, as the years went on and the more aware you became, I realized that I was trapped. After I got out of prison, I wanted to right my wrongs, so badly, but... you hated me, and this would only make you hate me more. So, I figured, if I never told you, you would live your life without finding out and it would spare me the argument‚Äî"

"How could you not think I would find out? Do you hear how idiotic you sound right now, dad?" I raised my voice, glaring at him with an angry expression.

"I know, I know, it was a bad decision."

"It was an _awful_ decision! An utterly _cruel_ and _evil_ decision!"

"Charlie, I've done so much bad in my life, I just wanted to be good. For you. For once, I wanted to be the father figure you never had‚Äî"

"Don't give me that bullshit," I scowled, standing up from my chair and pointing my finger at him. "It's a shame that you had to be arrested and sent to prison for you to figure this out. It's a real shame."

My dad went quiet. He looked down at his empty plate.

I placed my paws on my hips and walked around in a circle, aimlessly, shaking my head. I didn't know how to handle my anger. I just kept trying to walk it off.

"You want to know how you're going to fix it?" I confronted him, facing him eye-to-eye. I rested my paw on the table and leaned over him with intimidation. "You're going to find her."

"I can't do that, Charlie."

"Why not?"

"I told you. The name and address were withheld on each letter. There's no way I can find her."

"She told us she always wanted to move to LA. The night she ran away, she said we were going to LA. Why don't we start there?"

"There are over three million people living in LA, Charlie. It would take years to find her."

"Well, then, maybe there's some sort of hint or clue in those letters that could lead us to her location?"

"I've read those letters, over and over again for years. I found nothing."

"When was the last letter sent? You told me she sent one every month, did you get one this month yet? What did it say?"

"Charlie..." Hugo looked at me. It seemed as though I wasn't getting the idea. "The last letter she sent arrived... about a year ago. She stopped writing them."

"No..." I felt my heart sink. I couldn't give up hope this quickly. "No... No, we can still find her. We just have to look. I haven't read the letters yet, maybe I can find something."

"Charlie, no."

"I have to, dad! I have to find her!" I slammed my hand against the table.

"Charlie, there's no point. You're in the middle of your film. I'm in the middle of moving. It's not a good time. Maybe it never will be."

I began to grow desperate.

"You can't move yet! What if you get sent another letter to this address? You won't be able to read it. She won't be able to know you moved!"

"I told you, she hasn't sent a letter in over a year."

"She could still send one! When do you move?"

"In one week."

"One week?! I have one more week to look for her?"

"She won't send another letter in one week, Charlie."

"I'll still look for her. This next week, I'll look for her. I'll spend the next week looking for her, I will," I promised, not Hugo, but myself. I had to commit to this. "And if I don't find anything, then you can move out, but let me look for her, please. Give me one week."

"Charlie, it's been fifteen years since she left."

"Fifteen years and you never looked for her?"

"I told you, Charlie. I tried. Nothing came up."

"There's gotta be something in those letters that can point us in the right direction."

"I don't know, Charlie."

"Where are they?" I interrogated with determination, storming back through the dining room into the main hall, heading back up the stairwell.

"Charlie!" Hugo called after me, following in pursuit as I made my way up the stairs.

Reaching the hallway, I looked around, having forgotten what we had done with them. I spun in circles, trying to figure out where Hugo may have put them.¬†

_His bedroom._

_I've never been allowed in there._¬†

_His study was off-limits. His bedroom was untouchable._

_They've got to be in there._

I jogged further down the hallway, passing the door to my room. The door at the end of the hall was my father's.

"Charlie, wait!" Hugo hollered, catching up to me.

Without hesitation, I placed my paw on the handle of the door and opened it.

Inside, I expected to find a messy, disastrously organized display, but it wasn't that at all. It was actually pretty basic.

I found a small, compact bedroom with a medium-sized mattress on an illustrious dark wooden bed frame to the right. To the left, stood a large and wide dresser, filling the wall, with multiple sections and drawers. Inside the two top cabinets that stood beside each other held articles of my father's more fancy and pristine clothing. In between them, there were platforms for a TV, some ornamental decorations, and some picture frames, housing photos of Hugo, my mother, and me.

Below them stood three drawers. I wretchedly grabbed the handles and opened the first bin to find more of my father's clothes, folded up into neat piles. These were the ordinary, everyday outfits, instead of the businessman attire. I closed that drawer and opened the second one, finding piles of pajamas and night gowns. I closed that one and opened the last one, finding my mother's clothes.

I looked at them for a long moment, taking in the sight of them.

The fabric. The dresses.

It began to give me nostalgia.

I could smell a certain scent that radiated past memories of her.

Happy memories, like the bike ride.

I felt entranced. Caught in the past.

I looked over each pile of clothing, brushing my paws over the material.¬†

My mind went back to the time where she was wearing the certain sunflower dress my hands laid on. I was seven, and my mother was tickling me. I tried to fight back by holding her arms, feeling the grooves and strings of stitched fabric covering her body. This was the exact feeling.

It felt like a surge of serotonin had washed over me.

That was until I saw a slip of red peek out from underneath the dress, bringing me back to reality.

"Charlie, don't‚Äî" Hugo tried to stop me as he barged in.

I removed the dress to find more letters.

Not the ones in the vase, there were more.

I grabbed the other pairs of my mother's clothing and tossed them aside, revealing the stash of envelopes, filling the drawer to the brim. It looked as though there were fifty to one hundred letters in there, all the envelopes colored a vibrant red.

"There's more?!" I gasped, standing up and pointing at them. I turned to my father, who put his paws up in defense.

"They couldn't all fit in the urn, I had to keep them somewhere else!"

"You know what?" I muttered. Hugo braced himself for another shout of anger from me, but he got something unexpected. "This is good. I'll be able to find her with more evidence to work with."

"Charlie, you won't be able to find her."

"I will. And you're going to help me."

"What are you going to tell Skyler?"

I went quiet.

_I had thought a lot about this through the night after that phone call._

_I looked down at the drawer full of red envelopes and knew in my heart what I was going to do. It wouldn't be pretty, but I had to._

"I'm not going to tell him."

"...What?"

"I'm not going to tell Skyler."

"Why not?"

"I can't tell him. I can't let him know about this," I sniffled, on the brink of tearing up. "I'll tell him when the time is right, but in the meantime, I can't let him know. He'll want to help and I can't let him try to budge his way into another issue. He's already going through too much. This will only make him worse. I need to keep him from getting involved. I promised myself I wouldn't let him get involved. I'll tell him when I find her. When it's over."

My father stared at me as if I were crazy.

"He's just so sensitive about these things. I don't want to break him even more." I tried to convince him. "I just need to hold him together until I find her. When everything's okay, I'll tell him. But for now, he can't know."

"Are you sure that's the right decision?"

"I need to keep him safe. I need to keep him away from this, from us. He can't be involved. I won't let him get involved."

"If you lie to him, you'll only start a downfall waiting to happen. I lied to you and thought I could cover it up, but as time went by, my guilty conscience arose. And now look what's become of us. I don't want that to happen to you."

"He won't find out. And I'll find her. One week, that's all I need."

"You told me yourself, secrets get out."

"This isn't a secret and I'm not lying to him! I'm protecting him. There's a difference. He's done it to me before. He didn't tell me he came out to his parents until after he did it so that he could have the courage to do it by himself. I need to find my mother for myself. This is a Cooperton issue. Our problem, only. We have to find her, together."

"And if Skyler finds out?"

"He won't."

"But if he does?"

"Then I'll tell him! But for now, he stays out of this. You hear me?"

"I hear you, Charlie."

"We have one week. She can be anywhere in LA. We have hundreds of letters. We'll find her."

"You really think so, Charlie?"

"I do. We'll find her."

  

"We'll find her."

## Charlie

After a long and obnoxious drive, I was back at home.  

I desperately grabbed my phone as I parked the car, reading the time. It was 9 PM. Sky got home about an hour ago.

"Shit," I muttered to myself, frantically unbuckling the seatbelt and opening the car door, slamming it shut behind me. I hurried to the porch and snatched out my keys, placing them into the lock. My hands were shaking.

I opened the door and stepped inside. Much to my surprise, it was dark and devoid of life. Dust mites blew through the air, shimmering in the fire orange rays of the sunset that came through the windows, before disappearing from visibility after falling into the shadows.

_Was Sky even home?_

"Sky?" I called out, my voice echoing throughout the seemingly empty house.

I dropped my keys on the coffee table and toted my briefcase along with me as I made my way to the bedroom. The briefcase carried something important inside, so I kept it close to me. I opened the door to the hallway and rushed down the polished wooden floor, coming up on the door to our bedroom.

"Skyler, are you home?" I raised my voice, hoping to hear a response.

I grabbed the handle and opened the door slowly, entering the bedroom.

"Skyler?" My eyes searched, coming up with nothing. The bedroom was empty. He wasn't home.

I took a deep breath and walked inside, dropping the briefcase to the floor. I pulled my phone back out and opened a text thread with Sky, typing in the message, "Where are you?"

I sent it, clicking off my phone and placing it back into my pocket.

That was when I heard a phone chime from behind me.

Instinctively, I turned around, only for two arms to lunge over me and wrap around my shoulders.¬†

"BOO!" Sky jumped on top of me, ramming his lips against mine as he kicked his feet in the air. I latched my arms around his waist and lifted him up, trying to gain balance after the sudden fright. "I missed you!"

Sky began to shoot rapid-fire kisses all across my face, not limited to my lips, making an overly dramatic smooching noise each time. He was clearly overjoyed to be with me again. His happiness almost made me forget about everything I had gone through the past two days.

"I missed you, too, Sky," I tried to speak through the repeated action of Skyler's lips hitting my face. I began to giggle as he kissed me over and over, spinning him in circles. We both laughed, overtaken by a delightful feeling.

I loosened my grip on him, dropping him back down onto his feet, but that didn't stop him from keeping his hands off. He pressed the side of his face against my chest, hugging me tightly, soaking up every ounce of affection he can get.

"Okay, okay!" I chuckled, patting his head. He was in such a better place than me.

I wish I could have his happiness.

"I made money!" Sky screamed at the top of his lungs, pulling out a small slip of paper and shoving it in my face. I looked at the check for nine hundred dollars in his hand, my jaw dropping at the sight.

"Sky! Nine-hundred?!" I gasped in bewilderment.

"I know!" He squealed, gripping the sides of the check and jumping up and down. It was hard for him to contain himself when he was like this.

"Oh, come here," I growled, grabbing the sides of his face and pulling him in for another fired-up kiss. Sky kept on laughing through the contact of our lips.¬†

I reared back towards the bed, Skyler following with our mouths still connected. He balanced his toes onto the tips of my shoes, raising his heels to grow taller. I sat down on the bed behind me as Sky climbed over me, rooting his knees on the mattress of either side of my legs. I kicked off my shoes and looked up at him as he wrapped his paws around my neck. He continued to kiss me. We both leaned back down, collapsing onto the bed as we made out. Once we hit the blankets, though, our teeth clacked together from the sudden stop.

"Ah, sorry!" Sky hissed from the pain, rising back up to his knees and clasping a paw to his mouth. I had done the same.

"Don't worry, you're good!" I laughed, touching my fingertips to the front row of my teeth.

Sky began to blush in embarrassment, covering his whole face with his hands. "I got too excited," He muttered from underneath his paws. That was when I detected a band-aid wrapped around the ring finger of his right hand.

"Hey, what happened?" I questioned with concern, getting out from underneath his legs, sitting up in the bed, and gently grasping his wrists. I pulled the hand with the injured finger towards me. Sky sat on his hind legs as I examined the bandage.

"Oh, I just cut it on accident, don't worry. I should really get someone to help me extend measuring tape other than doing it myself," He chuckled as I wrapped my paws around the finger, holding it to my lips. I kissed his bandaged wound a few times and looked at him with a genuine grin, showing no teeth.

"Be careful, alright?" I stressed, cupping my paws around his hand and fondling it tenderly.

"You wanna talk about being careful?" Sky grabbed my right paw and held it up, revealing the bandage of gauze wrapped around my palm. "What is this?!"

_The cut on my hand. When I had gripped the shard too tightly._

"Oh, I, just... cut it on camera equipment," I lied, pulling it away from his grasp.

"It's so much more bigger than mine," Sky whined, trying to caress it as I had done to his wound, but I kept holding it away.

"I'll always be bigger than you, cupcake, in every way," I teased, brushing my paw through his whiskers.

"Shut up, not the time," He grunted, smacking my hands away.

"How did the job go? Tell me about it."

"It was amazing, Charlie," He gushed, bubbling with glee. His bright smile could say a million words. I could tell he was in a really good place. "I got to see this really beautiful town, meet wonderful people, and paint such an inspiring mural. It was like a dream. If every other job is like that, I think I really found what I want to do for a living."

"I'm so happy for you, sweetheart," I whispered, looking at him with eyes full of love and affection. I was so happy to see him happy.¬†

"But, enough about me," Sky shook his head, inching in closer to me in the bed. "I was surprised to see you weren't at home waiting for me with open arms!" Sky referenced what I had promised him when he got on the bus. "Where were you?"

I felt a sudden surge of doom.

_It's now or never, Charlie._

_Are you going to tell him the truth and risk exposing him to danger?_

_Or lie to keep him safe?_

  

"Work."

Sky's expression changed from happy to sympathetic.

"Oh, no, did they not find the footage?" He worried, leaning in and pressing his paw to my cheek.

"Huh?" My excuse wasn't as thought-out as I believed. I was just going with whatever I thought of.

"Well, if you went to work today, I presume you have one more week, right?"

"Oh, uh, yeah," I stuttered. I guess that was my excuse. "Yeah, no, the footage was lost."

_Maybe this could also be my excuse to look for my mother without Skyler's knowledge. I mean, I do supposedly have one more week to find her... and that one week lines up with my one more week of "work"..._

"Aw, that's too bad," Sky whimpered, rubbing his paw in a circular motion against my back. He seemed really upset over it. More than _I_ was supposed to. _Is this really the right thing to do?_¬† "Either way, how was it?"

"Work?"

"Yeah."

"Good."

Sky paused and looked at me.

"...Is that it?"

"What do you mean?"

"You have nothing else to tell me..?"

I felt my body grow a little warmer in suspense.

"Why..?"

_Did he know..?_

Sky sighed with a hint of disappointment, climbing off of my legs and lying down on the bed beside me. He stared up at the ceiling and scratched his forehead.

"I just wish you'd tell me things, other than saying it was just 'good'."

"Oh, uh," I stuttered, relieved he didn't know about the issue, but also concerned about a whole new issue he was apparently bringing up. "I'm sorry, I..."

"You don't have to say sorry, Charlie, I..." Sky then bit his lip and chuckled a little. "Every time I came home from elementary school, my mom would always ask how my day was... and I would always reply with 'good' and nothing else. It was either because I actually had a bad day and I didn't want her to worry, or I just wasn't in the mood for talking with her."

"Are you saying that you feel like a boring parent?"

"Yeah. I do. I feel like a boring parent trying to connect with their short-attention-spanned family. So, did you have a bad day, or do you just not want to talk about it?"

"Sky..."

"I don't want us to become those couples who are boring and don't find interest in talking to each other anymore. I don't want light conversation, I want to talk to you, Charlie."

"I had a good day and I want to talk about it. And we won't ever become a boring couple, Sky. I can promise you that."

Sky's expression then morphed back into a tiny smile.

He hopped up from the bed and sat with his legs crossed, returning to excitement.

"Then tell me everything that happened," Sky beamed, resting his chin in his palms, ready for a story. "I'm totally down for staying up all night hearing about it."

_I can't do this to him..._

_I can't spew lies when it seems to be the only thing that Sky wants to hear..._

"Sky, I'd... I'd love to, but..." I hesitated, which caused Skyler's face to slowly droop from happy to displeasure. "...I'm tired. I really need to get some sleep."

Sky didn't say anything. He just stared at me with that disheartened expression for an extended period of time. I felt worse every second that went by.

"But..." He whimpered below his breath. "What about dinner?"

"What about it?"

"Did you eat dinner yet?"

"Yeah, I got fast food on the drive home. You?"

"I... I waited for you..."

_Fuck, this is terrible._

Sky looked at the floor, still deeply saddened.

"Hey, go eat dinner, okay?" I suggested, touching my finger to the bottom of his chin and tilting his head up a little. "I don't want you living on an empty stomach."

"I wanted to eat dinner with you, I thought we would make noodles and watch a movie like we usually did. It's only nine," Sky pushed, clawing for any chance to spend more time with me.

_I can't do this..._

_Fuck... I can't do this to him..._

"Sky, what's wrong?" I stalled, knowing damn well the answer to that question.

"Nothing, I'm sorry, I... I'm overreacting again..." Sky exhaled, wiping his face with his paws.

"No, Sky, it's okay. Just go eat dinner, alright? I'll be right here."

"But I don't want you to sleep alone."

"And I don't want you to starve."

Sky closed his eyes and sighed. He then turned away from me, scooting over to the edge of the bed and dismounting it with a dismayed attitude. Before he became out of reach, I gently clenched his paw from the bed and held it softly.

"Sky, I'm sorry."

He kept facing away from me.

"For some reason, we can't go one day without fighting now," He mumbled, staring ahead.

"Again, Sky, it's not fighting," I pressed, moving over to the ledge of the bed. "They're just arguments. We're on our own and making our own decisions now, we're not going to agree on everything."

"But, it's always been just the two of us. And we always seemed to figure things out. We were Charlie and Skyler. What happened?"

"You can't expect things not to change, Sky."

"I miss college. I miss our old apartment."

"I miss it, too, Sky, but we can't keep living in the past. We have to move forward."

"I just feel like bad luck has been on our side lately. We haven't been ourselves."

"'Bad luck'?" I stressed, standing up from the bed and placing my paws on Skyler's shoulders. I turned him around. He didn't look up at me, only staring at my chest. "Sky... We're so incredibly lucky. Look at us. We have a house... careers... Sure, we're gonna go through some rough patches sometimes, but Sky, we'll always have each other to rely on. We're so _incredibly_ lucky to even have someone to hold on to. So lucky."

"You really think so?"

"I fell in love with Skyler Clawfield four years ago. And now I live with him. I'm the luckiest man in the world."

That was when Sky looked up at me. His eyes were tearing up, yet, he wasn't crying.

"I know this is hard, Sky. I know that this is hard to adjust to... and I know it's not what you signed up for when you agreed to move in with me... but we can't live the perfect story. We can't have the perfect romance. Things change. Whether we like them or not."¬†

_Those last few words came from deep inside me. I guess I was alluding to the recent revelation. But, it felt fitting for the moment._

Sky wiped his eyes of any teardrops and sniffled, clearing his throat.

He then leaned up and kissed me on the cheek.

"Get some sleep," He told me, nodding his head with a weak, frail attempt at a smile.

He turned around and walked out of the room, heading for the kitchen.

I released a lengthy, shaky sigh.

My eyes wandered to the briefcase.

I grabbed the handles of it and sat down on my knees before it. I unbuckled the case and opened it just a crack, staring at all the red envelopes of letters I had salvaged inside.

I sighed deeply once again and pressed my paw to my forehead.

_God, what are you doing, Charlie..?_

\~~~

I had said a lot of untruthful words to Skyler, but the fact that I was sleepy was not a lie. I conked out right after I had brushed my teeth, showered, and hopped into bed. I was so exhausted. Things had been piling up on me, one by one, and I just wanted to relax. For one moment.

But, of course, sleep had to be stolen from me. In the middle of the night.

My eyes awoke to the ceiling. The cracks in the plaster.

I turned my head to the right to see the digital clock on the bedside table. It read, "2:45 AM".

I turned my head to the left to see Skyler cradled up against my side, hugging me tightly.

I felt my soul smile just a bit.

_It wasn't enough to soothe me back to a peaceful sleep, though._

I felt overheated and in need of quenching my parched throat.

I slowly pulled the blanket off of me, careful not to yank it off of Skyler. I inched quietly and cautiously out of Skyler's arms, trying my very best not to wake him. Once his hands had left contact with my body, I sat up and dangled my legs over the ledge of the bed. I wiped my sweaty brow and took a few deep breaths.

I looked back at Sky.

He slept so peacefully. He was a beautiful creature.

_If I could freeze this image in my mind and look at it whenever I felt stress as bad as this, I would never be stressed again._

I grabbed the blanket and pulled it back over him, tucking Skyler in. I sighed, knowing he was safe in this house.

I felt confident enough to make a small break for the kitchen for a glass of water.

I tiptoed out of the room and made my way down the hallway, entering the kitchen. I opened a wooden cabinet and acquired a glass.¬†

I approached the fridge, staring at the water/ice dispenser.

_Fuck, please don't be loud..._

A tiny beep sounded when I set the machine for water only. I knew that ice would make a loud noise, so I didn't choose that setting. _Water was enough. Plus, it was refrigerated, so it would be cold anyway._

I pressed the glass up against the lever as the built-in fridge light turned on, making it clear for me when the glass was filled. I watched as the water spilled into the cup from the steady stream, making some noise, but not a lot.

Once it was filled, I took a rather long swig, refreshing my thirst.

The cup was then empty. I set it into the sink and scratched the back of my head as I made my way back to the bedroom, closing my eyes from the weariness.

That was when I heard footsteps coming from the hallway.

I opened my eyes and saw Skyler, standing in the doorway of the kitchen.

He looked at me with a blank expression, rubbing his eyes.

"Sky, I was just getting water‚Äî"

Skyler had stormed up to me and hugged me firmly, wrapping his arms tightly around my torso.

"Warn me before you leave the bed," He whispered.

"I'm not gonna wake you up in the middle of the night, Sky."

"Then don't leave the bed."

I sighed quietly and hugged him back.

\~~~

Skyler was fast asleep.

My arms were around him and his face was pressed up against my chest.

A few hours had passed and the sun was now dawning over the horizon, just out the balcony window.

I couldn't sleep.

I spent the whole night cradling Skyler.

I spent the whole night staring at the window by the bed.

I spent the whole night doing something I've never done in my sleep before.

  

I spent the whole night crying.

# 21. WHITE PICKET FENCE„âë

\~~~

## Skyler

I woke up to the sound of a shower running from the bathroom at six in the morning. My eyelids took a while to adjust and open up properly, but when they did, I found myself alone in the bed, under the messy, disorganized sheets. I was always accustomed to waking up to Charlie, so it felt a little strange, but it didn't get me down. I shouldn't let my reliance on others get in the way of my own happiness.

My body was usually very weak in the mornings. I wearily leaned up from the bed on my elbows, looking at the bathroom door, a sliver of light glowing from underneath the door frame. I heard the knobs being turned as the water stream came to a stop. It was then followed by the sound of the shower curtains being drawn and wet footsteps being made across the bathroom floor.

The door then opened and Charlie emerged with only one, mangy towel around his waist. Our eyes met and the husky smirked softly. I blushed and hid my face, rubbing my eyes as an excuse. "You don't freak out as much as you used to whenever you saw me naked."

"You have a towel."

"Still." Charlie grabbed another small towel from the bathroom and began to dry the drenched hair on his head. "We've been together for four years and I still haven't seen you with your shirt or pants off."

"I'm really self-conscious about my body," I whined, jokingly pulling the blankets all the way over me, reaching my neck.

Charlie chuckled and made his way over to the bed, walking across the carpeted floor.

"You're dripping all over the carpet, Charlie," I grunted, sitting up and throwing the sheets off of me.

"It's my house, I don't care," He teased, approaching the edge of the bed as I slid backward on the mattress.

"Um, it's our house, and I don't want you getting things wet‚Äî" I complained as Charlie crawled halfway onto the mattress, droplets of water hitting the blankets and pillows of his side of the bed. "‚ÄîCHARLIE COOPERTON, IF YOU GET A SINGLE DROP OF WATER ON ME‚Äî"

"Hey‚ÄîRelax, scaredy-cat, I was joking," He laughed, retreating from the mattress and leaning down to my height on the bedframe. I grunted and rolled my eyes, scooting over to Charlie's side of the bed, facing him.

"You have to go to work?" I asked him, resting my chin on my paw.

A few awkward seconds went by as he just stood there, staring at me. It ended when he nodded very lightly. "Do you have work today?" He asked, turning the question back around to me.

"Yeah! Ever since the mural, I've been getting job commissions left, right, and center."

"That's great, Sky! Where are you headed to now?"

"This new commission is different. It's digital, so I can work from home. Now I just have to bust out that old Surface Pro," I planned, looking around the room, trying to remember where I had left it.

"Yeah, I haven't seen you use that thing in a while? Where did it go?"

"It's somewhere in the storage boxes of my art studio, so I'll have to do some digging."

"I hope you find it," Charlie exhaled, leaning in for a kiss. I smiled and gave him what he wanted, a quick peck on his damp muzzle. He pulled away and looked into my eyes.

Something felt off about him.¬†

_He seems different than before. He's been like this ever since last night._

"Do you want to talk about last night?" I suggested, hoping to get something meaningful out of him. He, just, didn't appear happy, although he tried hard to make it seem that way.

"It's okay, Sky. I'm fine." He tried smiling once again. I smiled back, yet I still didn't trust that everything was as A-OK as he said.

"Dry off and change, you'll be late for work," I told Charlie as he nodded again quietly. He turned his back to me as he returned to the bathroom. I shifted back over to my side of the bed and watched him, staring at his tail. _It wasn't wagging as rapidly as it usually was. It was still._

Suddenly, Charlie purposefully let go of the towel around his waist. It fell to the floor and left his rear end exposed, which drove me to immediately slap my paw over my eyes.

"CHARLIE!"

"Oops."

\~~~

"Have a great day!" I ran and hugged Charlie from behind just as he was stepping out through the front door.

He didn't respond. No verbal reply, no snort of laughter, nothing.

He just turned around and gazed at me. The tips of his mouth were curled upward into a subtle grin... but his eyes... _I could only see pain in them._¬†

_It looked as though he wanted to cry, yet he was holding it in and putting on a mask that displayed happiness. For my sake._

I returned the gaze with sudden concern. "Are you okay?" My right paw clenched his arm and my left paw caressed his cheek.

"Yeah..." He whispered, jerking his head and pulling away from my grasp. "I just don't like leaving you..."

"Hey, d-don't worry, I'm not going anywhere," I stuttered, trying my best to comfort him. _Something was obviously wrong, but he just wouldn't tell me._

"I know you aren't," He told me. He bit his bottom lip and looked at the floor, formulating an idea in his head. "Tonight, let's, just... do whatever we want. Have fun. We could watch a movie, or... eat ice cream, or... dance to your music, or, whatever. Let's do anything."

"Sounds like a nice night." _It really did._¬†

I tried my best to change my expression back to happy, but it just wouldn't stop scrunching with worry.

"See you tonight," His voice was breaking. He quickly turned around and left for his car, trying to act as cool as possible.

He got into the car with his briefcase and pulled off into the road.

I stood there, not knowing how to feel.

\~~~

The creativity to do another art piece wasn't coming to me for some reason.¬†

I sat before the desk in my studio with an empty mind, staring at the Surface Pro planted on the tabletop. I was basically experiencing writer's block, _or, artist's block, if you will._ I didn't exactly know where to start. The method of seeing where my heart would take a line didn't apply this time through. Everything I tried to draw ended up not sitting right with me, so I erased it.

_Was it Charlie's behavior on my mind that was halting me from drawing?_ _Possibly._

I stood up from the chair and walked around the room, hoping boredom would give me the motivation.¬†

Instead, I found myself falling down the deep, dark hole of procrastination.

My mind journeyed each and every which way, making me think over things that I should get done before I actually do the task at hand. _It was my way of thinking I was getting things done, when in reality, I was finding more things to occupy my mind from the most important chore._

I thought back to the plan I had made, but hadn't really planned out or scheduled. I wanted to visit Claire and Jonathan and check in on them after what Becca had told me.

And before I even decided I would do it, I found my body picking up the Surface Pro and shoving it into the messenger bag I still had from college. I grabbed my keys, wrapped the bag around my shoulder, and headed for the front door. I locked the entrance to our house and stepped down from the porch, turning my attention to the bike I had yet to use after living in LA for a few weeks. Apart from the mural job, I haven't done much traveling away from the house. I pulled out my phone and dropped the address Claire had sent to me into Google Maps. I plugged in my earphones, hopped onto the bike, put on my playlist, and pedaled away from the driveway, heading into town.

\~~~

I've only seen pictures of Claire and Jonathan's house, but when you get to see the real thing, you can't help but undergo intimidation.

One look at that house and I immediately felt poor. It was a two-story modern estate with large windows, platinum housing material, balconies on every side, a garage, a backyard, and a pool. _A freakin' pool!_¬†To get to their house, I had to bike my way down a street adorning luxurious houses in a wealthy neighborhood. I saw myself admiring each and every one.

_I think now is a good time to mention Claire and Jonathan's occupations, as it's explanatory to why they're so unbelievably wealthy. Claire is currently a popular chef judge in a hot new cooking TV series that's streaming on Netflix. Let's be honest, that service has enough originals, but I'll take it if my best friend is in it. It's actually a pretty series. Jonathan is a star football player and is currently performing in the big leagues, being the best player on his team, entitled, 'The K9's'. The name sounds a little weird to me, but sometimes I feel like I've heard it before. I don't watch a lot of sports (correction: I don't watch any sports at all) so I don't really know how to explain his current state of success, but Charlie has told me that his team is winning. So, I guess they're winning. Claire and Jonathan are both doing very well with their lives. It's hard to not feel overwhelmed, standing in the presence of royalty._

I felt sort of nervous to be meeting them at their house unexpectedly. They might be busy with their busy lives and busy relationship.

_But, I mean, it's Claire and Jonathan. My friends. It shouldn't be that bad._

I walked up to the gates and chained my bike to the tall, white-picket fence that guarded most of the house against being seen by the public. I tapped my finger to the little intercom system that stood on the pillar in front of the gated entrance. It began to ring like a telephone, and then, I heard the voice of Jonathan reveal itself over the scruffy speaker.

"Hello?" He asked, his voice a little groggy. _I mean, it was early in the morning._

"Hey, Jonathan! It's Skyler!" I announced myself, hoping my presence would be a delight to him.

"Oh, hey, Sky!" His tone now seemed much more upbeat. "What're you doing here?"

"I... just, thought I'd stop by and see how you guys are doing!"

"Aww, let me let you in, one sec," He prompted, hanging up the call.

After a few seconds of passing time, I heard the front door of their house open, followed by footsteps towards the large, white-picket gate. I stood back, ready to see Jonathan's face.

The large gate began to budge, but wouldn't open.

"Hehe, one moment," I heard Jonathan laugh awkwardly, trying to get the door to open.

"Everything alright?" I asked, watching as the gate began to shift and shake from Jonathan's attempts to bust it open.

"It's an electronic lock, it's been having issues ever since we've moved in. I'm gonna have to get it checked out," Jonathan grunted, pulling on the door with force.

I saw two lion paws grip the peak of the fence as the top of his head poked out from behind it. I saw his eyes as they looked down at me. "Give me your hands," He instructed.¬†

_Okay, I'm not that tall. I was 5'6 at best, so this was a bit of a challenge, considering Jonathan and the wall, together, were over six feet._¬†

I reached up, standing on the tips of my toes, trying my best to grasp his paws. Once I was able to hold on, he instructed, "Now, just climb up the fence with your feet."

"Oh, God," I whispered to myself, pressing my shoes against the wooden material. _I was not one for real-world activities, but I was pretty nimble and skinny, so it shouldn't be that hard._¬†

I began to walk the fence as if I were at a rock climbing gym, using Jonathan's hold as my rope. He was incredibly strong and I was very light, so he didn't have a problem. Once I reached the top of the fence, I planted my feet on the ledge, ready to jump over.

"There we go," Jonathan encouraged, letting go of my paws and holding his arms outward. "I got you, don't worry."

"I'm not having a love story with my boyfriend's best friend," I joked.

"I am one-hundred percent straight, Skyler."  

I leaped over the ledge and fell into his arms. We both laughed at the random exercise routine. "You good?" He asked, patting my shoulder.

"Yeah, thank you," I laughed, catching my breath.

"How are you, man? I haven't seen you in a while," Jonathan questioned, taking the sight of me in. Seeing him again made me realize how long it's really been since we've talked or interacted.

"It has been a while, hasn't it? Wasn't graduation was the last time we saw each other? I've been good, you?"

"Yeah, I've been great."

"How are you and your wife?" I teased, placing emphasis on the 'wife'.

"Don't remind me that she's my wife, makes me feel older," He chuckled.

"You're twenty-three, you're fine," I groaned with a giggle. "How's, um... How's the... gaming... going?"

"You still don't understand sports, do you?"

I shook my head awkwardly.

"Don't worry, I won't bore you with an hour-long recap of how football works. Come inside," He suggested, walking over to the front door and holding it open for me.¬†

_I don't understand what Becca was talking about, things seem perfectly fine._

"You're here to see Claire, I assume?" Jonathan theorized as I made my way through the entrance of the house.¬†

"I came to see both of you guys, really‚ÄîOh, my God!" I gasped, taking in the sight of the interior of their house.

At first, it felt like I had stepped into a club. The main hall was one large, wide, spacious room that housed the kitchen, dining table, and living room in one. There was no fourth wall, leading north, it was completely missing. It lead to the broad, expansive backyard, which had a few couches, a small coffee table, a fireplace, and, of course, the pool. The whole interior was designed with modern architecture and a blank white color scheme, making every surface feel clean and shiny. It was like I had walked into an Apple mobile store.

"You like it?" Jonathan reacted to my reaction.

"Of course, he likes it, hon," I heard a female voice echo in the vast living space. I turned my attention to the right, where the source of the voice had come from, to see Claire, entering the room from a hallway that lead to other doors and rooms. The fox approached us, wearing a beautifully natural, white dress. She had a flower tucked behind her ear and a glass of wine in her left paw. _I guess people who have recently moved in find themselves endorsing wine._¬†

She frolicked over to us and gave Jonathan a kiss on his cheek before reaching down and hugging me like her life depended on it. She was as light and bubbly as a balloon. She looked absolutely amazing, Jonathan was a lucky man.¬†

"What a surprise it is to see you here," Claire beamed, squeezing me tightly. Her aura could brighten anyone's day. "How are you, babe?"

"I've been doing well, you?"

"I've been just perfect," She smiled, pulling away and interlocking her arm with Jonathan, resting her head on his shoulder. He kissed her forehead in return, making her blush with pleasure.

_I felt a bit like a third wheel, but how could I get in the way of their happiness?_¬†

_They seemed so... perfect._

"How's the online business going?" Claire asked suddenly as if she had forgotten I was here, distracted by Jonathan's affection. _They've definitely been enjoying their time here together alone..._  

"Great! I've been getting jobs!" I told them, trying my best to sound as successful as I could be.

"Really? That's incredible, Sky!" Claire shined like a beam of sunlight.

"It's good to see you in the workforce,¬†_not_ as a coffee shop cashier," Jonathan bantered.

"Yeah, the business has felt very suiting for me. I get to do what I love and make my own money. I actually had to do a digital commission today, but I decided to stop by before heading back to work."

"Oh, would you want to work on it here? It's nice and quiet, you could focus and feel the sunshine outside... We'd love to have you!" Claire suggested.

"Oh, please, don't let me bother, I was just gonna pop in and out really quick," I pleaded, gripping the strap of my messenger bag.

"You biked all the way here on your own, I'm not making you bike all the way back," Jonathan added. He had seen the bike chained to the fence earlier. "Sit down, relax, do your thing. I'll be going out soon, so you'll have time alone with Claire."

"Yeah, today's my day off from set, spending it with you would be incredible," Claire chirped.

"You both are really too kind, but I should _really_ head out," I winced until Claire had made a 'pfft' sound with her mouth and wrapped her arm around me.

"Come on, babe, stay with us for a bit," Claire persuaded, walking me over to the backyard. Jonathan followed.

"Are you sure I'm not interrupting anything?" I attempted, only for Claire to shake her head and sit me down on the couch by the pool.

I looked around. Claire and Jonathan really had the life they wanted, right here and right now. They had a house that felt like a vacation resort, basked in the golden beams of the sun, adorning the perfect temperature, the perfect backyard view, the pool was glistening, the birds were chirping, the breeze was soothing... _Damn..._

Jonathan appeared next to us on the couch and handed me a non-alcoholic drink (which was literally just a glass of milk). Claire massaged my shoulder and calmed my nerves. I felt as though I was beginning to be treated like royalty.

_I mean, I guess I could stay here for a few... hours..._

\~~~

Somehow, Claire and Jonathan's serene, illustrious suite was enough to ease my mind off of Charlie and hop back into my work cycle. The digital commission was coming out nicely, not exactly what I had idealized, but you live and you learn. A few hours had passed and a massive, dark cloud had shifted above the sky, signifying an oncoming rainfall. Claire beckoned me inside, and the moment I got in, it began to pour. I absolutely despise water, but the flash of lightning and eruption of thunder was what _really_ got me scared.

Jonathan was still out doing things, so Claire was a little worried about his current state, whether outside in the storm or not. She made me sit in her and Jonathan's room as she called him out in the hallway. Sitting alone at the end of their king-sized bed made the bedroom of our own house seem like a pigsty. I mean, it was grand, lavish, majestic, basically every synonym you'd find for 'luxurious' on thesauraus.com. Me and Charlie's was a complete mess. But, somehow, we liked the mess. It felt comforting and familiar.

Claire came back inside once the phone call was over as the sound of rain pitter-pattered on the sidewalk, walls, windows, and roof outside. The bedroom was air-conditioned and very consoling. The bed was soft and the blankets were fluffy. _I bet they got away with a lot at night. It was scary to even think they did those certain things exactly where I was situated._¬†

Claire jumped onto the mattress, turning her back to me. She lied down on her back, her feet touching the pillows, her head lying in the middle of the bed, next to my tail. With a chuckle, I lied down as well. We both stared up at the ceiling, our heads resting right next to each other, our belly-up bodies pointed in opposite directions.¬†

"Is he okay?" I questioned. She didn't tell me the outcome of the phone call.

"Yeah, he's indoors, so he's doing fine. I don't know how he's getting home, though," She scoffed.

I felt now was a good time to bring up Becca's concerns and try to weave my way through their apparent "white-picket-fence" illusion.

_I didn't think anything was wrong, they seemed happy._¬†_Maybe if I asked, I'll unravel something. I'll do it for Becca, at least._

"How are things with you and Jonathan? Good, I hope?"¬†

My question caused an unexpected silence from the vixen. After a small moment of hesitation, she looked at me with an unusual brightness in her eyes.

"Yeah. We're good."

_Hmm..._¬†

_Okay, I guess Becca had a point._

"Are you sure?"

"Hm?" Claire wondered, confused by my sudden concern.

"It's, just..." I rambled, trying my best not to offend her or anything. "Becca told me that something felt off with you guys. I don't really see it, but she seemed pretty convinced something was wrong."

Claire looked back up at the ceiling.¬†

She sighed.

"Becca said that?" She asked with a monotone voice.

"Yeah..." I mumbled below my breath, not knowing what to make of the situation. I touched my paw to her shoulder. "Hey, you okay?"

"Yeah, I'm fine."

"What's wrong?" I asked. Her silence made me more and more anxious. "Claire, you can tell me anything, you know that, right?"

Claire sighed once again and began to rub her forehead.

"We're... We're kinda going through a rough patch right now."

"What happened?"

"It's a long story," She blew air out through her teeth.

I sat up from the bed and looked down at her.

"I'm willing to listen. I can't really do anything else."

"What about your commission?"

"I can finish it later. Either way, I won't be able to work on it if you're having issues."

"Sky, it's really nothing."

"It's never nothing. That's something I've come to learn."

"Are you sure you want to know?"

"I'm here for you, Claire. Always."

Claire closed her eyes and took a deep breath.

"Alright," She gave in, sitting up and turning around, folding her legs.

I sat down in the same way, facing her.

By the look of her face, I could tell I was in for a heavy story.¬†

"Here we go," She exhaled, ready to tell me everything. "So..."  

  

# 22. THE PRINCESS

\~~~  

## Claire

_"Claire Chloe Harper, the Princess."_

I stared at the food on my plate, untouched.

The fork rested between my fingers, yet I couldn't move my hand.

I heard the sound of Jonathan chewing on his food next to me. I turned my attention to him, watching the lion as he daintily sliced his knife through the vegan steak, stabbed the piece with his fork, and guided it into his muzzle. I saw his molars attack the food from under his muzzle's fur, his jawline maneuvering as he carefully scarfed down the meal.

I looked over at the backyard, staring at the full moon, glowing in the sky full of stars. They were bright and visible, likely because we had dimmed down most of the lights and were dining by candlelight. The reflection of the moonlight wavered and morphed in the pool water.¬†

It was a calm setting, but my thoughts were troubled.

"Hon, you okay?" I heard Jonathan ask.

I looked back at him and resisted a fake smile, yet I couldn't help but¬†act all prim and perfect in front of him. I never wanted Jonathan to worry about me, we had committed to keeping our relationship as unproblematic as possible. We never enjoyed fighting, or arguments, or disagreements, or... _anything bad, really._

"Yeah, I'm okay," I piped up, picking up my fork and focusing on the meal, finally.

"Claire?" Jonathan urged before I could even take a bite. "You seem troubled."

"I'm not," I tried my best to convince him. "Really, I'm not, I... I was just thinking..."

Jonathan stared at me, waiting for me to continue. He placed his paw on my arm and gave me a look of comfort.

"Look, Jonathan, I know we promised each other, a really long time ago that we wouldn't... 'settle down'..." I began, staring at my plate of food instead of the face of my husband. "...but I... I don't know... I've been having thoughts about... starting a family and..." A small smile began to creep onto my face. "...I've imagined being a mother, and... I like the idea of it."

"Um..." I heard Jonathan clear his throat awkwardly. I looked up at him, noticing that he was caught struggling with his feelings.¬†

His paw moved away from mine as he twisted his fork, trying his best to get his thoughts in line.

"I mean... Claire, I love you, but we did _just_ get married‚Äî"

"‚ÄîYes. Yes, I know, it... It was just a thought..." I shook my head, picking my fork and knife back up.

"Claire, sweetheart," He tried his best not to make the mood turn sour. "Your heart's in the right place, and I love that you're thinking about motherhood, but I'm not exactly... _there_ yet."

"Yeah, no, of course. I shouldn't force you into anything."

"You're not. Don't worry."

"I've, just... always thought about it, you know?" I went on my own personal tangent, not caring if he was paying attention anymore. I just wanted to say my feelings out loud. _I've always wanted to, but I never found the right time_. "My mom, I loved her... but, she had so many issues... She didn't take care of me properly, I just thought that maybe... if I had a go at her job, I could do it better. It would fill that little gap in my soul that she left‚Äî"  

"Claire?"

"Yeah?"

"You shouldn't be worrying about that. Not right now," Jonathan encouraged, holding my hand once again. "You're young and you just got married. You don't have to rush into things, okay? Let's just take it slow. I want to take it slow."

I looked into his eyes with a sense of longing. He didn't seem to detect it.

"...Yeah. Definitely."

That was when we heard the loud buzzing of the doorbell.

Jonathan and I both looked at each other, shocked by the sudden noise that had interrupted our intimate moment.

"I, uh... I'll get it, just stay there, it's probably no one," Jonathan consoled, sitting up from the dining table and carefully touching my shoulder before leaving. He departed from the table and fled for the hallway, hoping to shoo away anyone who was outside.

I sat at the table, scanning my empty surroundings.

While Jonathan was gone, I quickly snagged a napkin and pressed it to my eyes, wiping away any tears that had almost broken free. I sniffled a few times and cleared my throat, trying to maintain my normal, perfect disposition. _I had to get rid of these feelings as fast as I could before Jonathan had come back‚Äî_

"It's Becca," I heard him say as he walked back into the room.

I immediately picked my head up and widened my eyes. "Becca is here?"

"Yeah, she's asking for you to come out."

\~~~

I walked up to the tall, white-picket gate with Jonathan following close behind. I could hear the crickets chirp under the sound of Becca knocking her fist onto the wooden planks of the fence.¬†

"'Ello? Anyone home?" She mocked in an overly-dramatized British accent on the other side of the gate.

I grabbed onto the handle of the fence and tried to pull it open, but it wouldn't budge.

"Sorry, Bec, one moment," I grunted, tugging on the knob with all of my strength. "This door has been a complete nightmare ever since we've moved in."

I stepped back and rammed my shoulder into the door, which unlocked it successfully with a violent thud. The female wolf was on the other side. She stood back, dodging the swinging gate from hitting her with a surprised look on her face. "Whew, there we go!" I scoffed, looking back at Jonathan. He nodded his head at my attempt to show off my strength. I turned mine back to Becca. "So, what's up?"

"You ready?" She asked. She was wearing an outgoing outfit; dressed in high-heel boots, a pearl beige Daytona cutout dress, a purse slinked around her shoulder, and a face adorned with sharp eyeliner and blush.¬†

"Rea... Ready for what?" I questioned with a hint of confusion.

"Girls' night out..?" She answered, holding her paws out as if it was obvious. I felt a sudden sense of stupidity come over me.

"Oh, shit! That was tonight?!" I gasped, slapping my paw to my empty-headed forehead.¬†  

"Yeah, did you forget?!" Becca chortled, her eyebrows furrowing teasingly.

"Fuck, I was caught up with the show, we'll have to do it another night‚Äî" I planned to reschedule, but that was until Jonathan interrupted.

"No, no, it's okay! Go have fun, babe," He encouraged me, kissing my forehead.

"What? Are you sure?" I asked him, worried to be leaving my husband alone.

"I mean, it's only 9. And you're already dressed up."

"I'm always dressed up."

"Of course you are."

"But, what about our... _our talk_..?" I lowered my voice in front of Becca. She could tell we were acting strange, but it didn't seem like she cared.

"We'll continue that another time, babe," Jonathan whispered back. "Go, enjoy your night out."

"You mean it?"

"Go, Claire," He assured with a confirming smile.

I sighed, but I couldn't _not_ smile back. _I did need this._

"I love you," I swooned, leaning up and kissing him.

Becca rolled her eyes and began to gag mockingly. Jonathan took that as a challenge, grabbing my waist, pulling me in, and then leaning over me, causing me to lean back as well as we kissed passionately. He grabbed my leg and held it up just for kicks, much to Becca's amusement and/or displeasure. It was like every epic romantic gesture in every epic romance flick.

"Alright, you two, she's coming with me," Becca snickered, grabbing my arm and stealing me away from my husband.

As she guided me over to her van, I blew a kiss to the lion. He blew one back and winked.

\~~~

The shot glass was gripped firmly between my fingers. I stared at the golden tinted liquid in the small chalice, ready to ingest another ounce of tequila for the fifth time tonight.

"Three, two, one!" Becca shouted.

The moment I heard the final number, I immediately reached the glass up to my muzzle and poured the drink into my maw, swallowing it instantly in one quick, lightning-fast movement. I slammed the shot glass back down on the counter and shoved my fist in the air, whooping at the top of my lungs.¬†

I looked over at Becca, who had slammed her shot glass down one millisecond after I did. She rested her head on the counter and moaned, seemingly sick to her stomach.

"How do you handle your alcohol so well?" She muffled, pressing her snout up against the table.

"Been doin' it for years," I smirked, leaning back on the bar stool seat, and twisting around in the rotating chair.¬†

As I spun, I caught a quick glimpse of the environment around us. We were reclining in the condensed, average, local bar in the middle of town. We had gotten here about an hour ago after frolicking around the city and hopping from one pub to the next. The one we were at currently was relatively empty since it wasn't _that_ well known. It was also almost midnight, so people were packing up and closing up shop. Becca and I were really the only _real_ customers left. I was feeling a little loopy, but Becca was as drunk as a skunk. She wasn't in a daze, but she was slipping up on her words a bit. Becca's "drunk behavior" wasn't the cliche 'acting like a mess' routine. Instead, she said the wrong things and the wrong time. It was kind of cute.

"Tell me," Becca straightened her back, picking her head up. "Who, out of all of our friends, can handle their alcohol the best?"

"Jonathan and Charlie are tied, they're, like, mirror images."

"And the worst?"

"Oh, Skyler, obviously."

"Didn't he throw up after taking only two shots on his 21st?" She laughed, causing me to laugh as well.

"You know, we should really invite Skyler to these things."

"But, he's a boy. This is _girls'_ night out."

I gave her a look. She picked up on it.¬†

"Wait, are you thinking the same thing I've been thinking?" She asked, returning the same look back to me.

"I've suspected it for a while," I admitted, playing with the shot glass. "And I've tried asking him questions before, but he hasn't really gotten the chance to open up to me about it."

"Do you reckon Charlie suspects it?"

"I don't know. But we shouldn't budge, we'll let him come to us when he's ready."

"Hello, ladies," The bartender intruded on our conversation with a sly manner, laying down two martinis on the bar counter before us, one for each of us.

"Um, we didn't buy these," Becca spoke up with an awkward chuckle.

"I know. They did," The bartender told us, nodding his head to our left.

Becca and I both turned our heads in that direction to see two males, eyeing us down cunningly with smirks on their faces. They sat at a circular table across the bar in the far distance, yet their intentions were clear. Oddly enough, it was a fox and a wolf, as a matter of fact.

"Ugh," I rasped, looking over at Becca with a hint of disgust. She glared back at me and rolled her eyes.

I turned my attention back to the men and held up my paw, showing them the ring on my finger. Becca then wrapped her arms around me and stared at the two men. "Sorry, fellas, we're married!" She joked, causing me to sputter with laughter.

We watched as the color drained out of the men's faces. Becca then kissed me on the cheek to sell the performance to them, which it did.¬†

"Thanks for the drinks, though!" I added, grabbing the martini from the counter and taking a sip through the straw.

The two then looked back at their own drinks and returned to their own little conversation with a hint of disappointment. Becca retreated from her embrace as I turned my chair back around. We both tried to maintain straight faces, but we eventually broke out into hysterical laughter.

"I don't think I can take any more alcohol," Becca chuckled, grasping the tall glass with a tiny paper umbrella and a swirly straw.

"Then don't drink," I taught her as I swallowed the gin down my muzzle.

"And lose to you? I don't think so," Becca snorted, drinking the martini with determination.

"Yeah, you're not driving tonight."

"But I have such a cool place to show you!"

"Tell me where it is and I'll drive us."

"No, it has to be a surprise!"

"Becca, I'm not dying tonight."

"Ugh, fine. You drive. Let's go," Becca prompted, setting her glass down on the counter, barely even a sip taken from it. She sat up and hopped onto her feet, heading for the exit.

"Wait, now?" I asked, jerking my head back with a scoff.

"Yeah, c'mon!" She reached into her pocket and pulled out her van's keys, tossing them over to me.  

Luckily, I caught them, one-handedly. With my other hand, I sat down the martini on the counter. Then, I sat up and followed her out of the bar.¬†

\~~~  

The two of us found ourselves sitting on the roof of Becca's van, on top of another roof. The roof of a large multistorey parking garage in the middle of Hollywood.¬†

I had parked the vehicle where Becca had wanted me to, and she was right, it was a surprise. I never expected the view from the top of a parking complex to be so stunning. Becca and I looked over the landscape, spotting out the variety of glowing buildings, passing headlights of cars, silhouettes of palm trees swaying in the dark sky, etc.

Becca and I just sat, our legs hanging over the edge of the van, admiring the view.

"Hey, how are you and Jonathan doing?" Becca questioned, breaking the silence.

"We're good, why do you ask?" I responded.

"I don't know... Recently, you've both seemed kind of awkward," Becca slurred, her voice getting quieter and quieter. She was trying her best to stay awake, fighting all the alcohol in her system.

I grew quiet as well, not because I was drunk. _Well, I guess it was because I was drunk... because I began to consider telling Becca everything I was feeling._

Usually, I never told anyone about my issues. Becca and Skyler were my best friends and they always had my back, but I never felt comfortable with being open about myself in front of them.

But, tonight, I did.

"Do you think I'm rushing into things?" I asked, my voice blowing into the midnight wind.

"What do you mean?" Becca garbled, blinking rapidly to try and remain stable.

"Jonathan and I... We got married so young... Do you think we rushed into it?"

"Well, do you love him?"

"Of course I do. But, what if I don't love him enough?"

"Do you have doubts?"  

I took a deep breath and sighed, looking straight upwards at the stars above us.

"Remember when I told you in high school that I wanted to have a wedding and a family and a perfect life when I got out of college?"

"Yeah?"

"I think I pushed that fantasy way too hard on Jonathan. Without even telling him."

"Huh?"

"When we started dating, we originally promised we wouldn't become those _boring_ couples that got married and had kids..." I closed my eyes, feeling the heat, or should I say, _the breeze_ of the moment, calming my soul. "I originally thought he was joking, but... we were too deep into our relationship when I had realized he'd meant it. I don't think he wanted to get married. And I don't think he wants to start a family. I think he only did it for me. I'm scared that I pushed my own fantasy onto Jonathan without him even knowing it."

"Hey..." Becca mumbled, placing her paw on my shoulder. I turned my head over to her, facing the drunken wolf dead on. "If he doesn't want this life, don't let him have it. Screw him."

_Her sudden pessimistic tone had caught me off guard._

"What..? But I love him?"

"Yes, but does he love you enough to be honest with you?" She interrogated, changing the mood of the moment. "Do _you_ love Jonathan enough to be honest with _him_?"

_Becca seemed incredibly drunk, so I knew that I shouldn't be listening to her tipsy advice, but... I couldn't help but pay attention._

"Maybe, if we just talked about it‚Äî"

"If that man hurts you, I will hurt him."

"W-what? Becca, he's not gonna hurt me."

"You never know. That's men for you."

"Becs, are you okay?"

"I'm fine, why?"

Becca began to lose her balance. I grabbed her by the shoulders so she wouldn't fall off the roof of the van. I stared into her eyes and examined them, noticing how listless they appeared.

"You look _really_ out of it. I think I should get you home."

"We're already at my home, remember?" Becca said, tapping her foot to the van underneath us.

"Becca, I'm worried about you."

"No, I'm worried about _you!_"

"I think you should stay over at me and Jonathan's tonight."

"I'm fine, Claire, you don't have to talk to me like I'm a drug addict."

"I didn't say that!"

The tension began to rise, and before I knew it, Becca was irritated.

"You're lucky, you know? You found a husband. Sky has a wonderful boyfriend. And I'm just here, in love with my fucking van," She huffed, fumbling free from my grasp, turning her body away from mine.

"Becca, don't say that. You'll find someone."

"What if I don't want to?"

"What do you mean?"

"What if I already found someone?"

"Becca, you're drunk."

"What if that someone is a girl I've known for a very long time?"

"Rebecca, stop‚Äî"

  

_That was the moment things had taken a turn for the worst._

Becca had kissed me.

  

_I don't know if it was because I was drunk or surprised, but I didn't pull away._

_It had lasted a few seconds. It felt like a minute almost._

_Everything about it felt wrong, but it didn't stop. I don't know if I even wanted it to stop._

  

Becca pulled away from me and stared into my eyes.

_I could see the sorrow on her face._

_She immediately regretted what she had done._

_I immediately regretted not stopping her._

  

"Becca..." I whispered.

Tears came to the wolf's eyes.

"You know that I'm married, right..?"

The wolf nodded her head.

"And you know that I love Jonathan..?"

She closed her eyes and nodded once again.

"And I love you, but as a friend. You know that, right?"

She nodded one last time.

  

"Claire..." Becca sniffled, looking down and hiding her face.¬†

"I've been in love with you ever since high school."

  

"No. Don't say that," I responded.¬†

_It was the only response I could think of at the moment._

_Because it was the last thing I wanted to hear._

"It's true."

"You're drunk."

"I'm not lying!"

"Becca. No. You can't do this to me."

"I love you, Claire."

"Stop."

"I've been in love with you for so long..."

"Stop it, Becca!"

"I was always so jealous when you dated guys... I was always so jealous when they had you... Touched you... Kissed you... When you got with Jonathan, my blood began to boil..."

"BECCA!"

"When you got married, I felt so disgusting inside... I hated him... I hated him so much because I thought he took you away from me..."

"STOP!"

"I hate Jonathan..."

"Rebecca, you're DRUNK!" I pushed her away, standing up on the roof of the van. Becca was still seated on the surface, her eyes closed, showing no expression. I raised my voice, talking down at her with rage. "I _love_ Jonathan! I am _married!_ You can't do this to me when I'm trying to tell you about how I want to start a fucking _family_ with him!"

"I'm SORRY!" She yelled, rubbing her eyes.

"You don't love me! You can't! You can't love me that way, alright?!"

"Alright!" Becca whimpered, tears streaming down her face. She was crying instantly, moans and sniffles all around. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."

_She looked so broken._

_I felt bad for yelling at her, but..._

"Becca..." I sighed, shaking my head. "Look, we're just drunk, alright? This is really not a good time for us to talk about this."

"I'm sorry..." She wept with a subtle, broken whine. The wolf hid her face as she wiped her eyes, silently bawling.

"Come on, I'll drive you to my house. I have a guest room. You're sleeping there tonight."

"No, no, I'm better off in the van‚Äî"

"No, come on, let's go home," I persuaded, lowering onto my bottom and leaping off of the van, hitting the concrete of the parking garage. I turned around and held my arms up, gesturing for her to hop down into my grasp. "Come on. I'll catch you."

Becca reluctantly turned around and climbed down the side of the van herself, avoiding any kind of contact from my embrace. She grabbed the interior van door handle and opened it, climbing inside and shutting it behind her before I could say a single thing.

I sighed and rubbed my temples.

_Tonight was a total dumpster fire._

I grabbed the handle of the driver's seat door and boarded the van, taking the wheel.

After locking in my seatbelt, I turned around and looked at Becca.

She sat on her bed in the back, with her arms around her legs.

"I'm sorry, okay?" I told her with a more calming tone of voice. "Rebecca, I love you. We're just drunk. We'll talk in the morning, alright?"

"Alright."

\~~~

"I took her home and let her stay in the guest room. She conked right out on the bed the moment she lied down. I got back into bed with Jonathan and... I don't know why, but I... I didn't tell him what happened. The next morning, you came by and‚Äî"

"Wait, this was yesterday?" Skyler asked, his face full of surprise. I nodded my head. "Is she still here?"

"She hasn't woken up since."

"You didn't tell me she was staying here?"

"I didn't want her to freak out and leave."

"Oh," Sky exhaled, looking down, concentrated on his own thoughts and opinions.

I sighed and lied back down on the bed, exhausted from all the storytelling. Sky sat there, looking down at me. He brushed his paw gently across my face, pushing the orange locks of hair out of my eyes. His expression showed sympathy. _I could tell, he didn't want to say anything to ruin the moment._ He just kept caressing my face, calming my nerves. _I loved the way his touch felt, cats have such soft paws..._

"I love Jonathan. And I love Becca," I began to confess my feelings below my breath. "I love them both so much. Why do I feel like I have to decide?"

"What do you mean?"

"I feel like I'm being given a choice, either Jonathan or Becca. I want to love both of them, but... I feel like Jonathan isn't happy with me and... Becca has been in love with me since high school. And I never picked up on it. I'm so confused. Why, after knowing these two for so long, _why_ am I having doubts about each of them _now_?"

"What kind of doubts?"

_Skyler was reaching into my mind and finding all of my intrusive thoughts, and I was allowing him to. I don't know how he was able to make me feel that comfortable, but... It's Skyler. He's one of the most kindhearted people I've ever met..._

"What if I'm not in love with Jonathan? What if I dated him just to get married and have kids? What if I rushed into things without spending the proper time to know what each of us wants? And what if I do like Becca and I don't know it? Ever since she kissed me, I've been thinking about her, nonstop... But I don't know if it's because I have feelings for her or because I'm scared of her. Why am I conflicted? I should know the answer: I love Johnathan as my husband, but do I? I love Becca as my friend, but do I?"

"Hey, I get it, when I first felt things for Charlie, I‚Äî"

"Sky, no, wait‚ÄîSky. Please don't say 'you get it'," I pressed, sitting back up and scooting over to the head of the bed frame, resting my back on the pillows. "I don't mean to be rude but every time someone says that to me, I just get annoyed. Like, 'you're not me, so don't try to empathize with me', you know?"

"Oh, yeah, no, totally. I get it." Sky then winced and shook his head. "No, wait, I don't. I don't get it."

I began to chuckle. Skyler did as well. We both giggled softly for a small moment.

Suddenly, I felt a tear stream down my cheek.

"I'm so selfish. I'm sorry," I whined, resting my head down into my knees, cradling into a ball.

"No, no, no‚Äî"

"No, I'm a terrible person‚Äî"

"You are not a‚Äî"

"Yes, I am. I'm a mess. I have so many flaws."

"Claire. Come here." I felt Skyler's paws touch my head from either side, picking it up from my ball of sadness. I looked at him, seeing the comfort in his eyes. He came closer and wrapped his arms around me. "You know I love you, right?" I closed my own eyes, melting into the embrace.

_Skyler was exactly who I needed at this moment._

"Mhm."

"I don't care how many flaws you have, you wanna know why?"

"Why?"

"Because your strengths will always,¬†_always,_¬†outnumber them. Okay?"

"Okay."

"This isn't my place to tell you how to feel, it's yours. Catch my drift?"

"N... No."

Skyler retreated from the hug and continued to look into my eyes.

"Talk to them. Both of them. Tell them how you feel. Tell them about how conflicted and confused you are, be completely honest. Help them to help you. Let them guide you and each other, simultaneously. Alright?"

"That won't work. If Johnathan finds out that I'm conflicted, he'll think it's a competition between him and Becca. For my love. He won't appreciate that and he'll leave me."

"Then I guess we have a winner," Skyler said with a hint of sarcasm.

"What?"

"If your boyfriend of 4 years leaves you all because you're troubled? Fuck him!" Skyler laughed, making me smile even if I tried to fight it. "I'm only saying that because I _know_ he wouldn't do that, he's Jonathan. He loves you. I know who I'm rooting for, but if you still have doubts, let this 'competition' play out. See if he's worthy of your love. See if he believes that you are worth fighting for. If he does, he'll see to what's hurting you and he'll heal it. If that gives you the answer you're looking for, problem solved. He loves you and you love him."

I began to blush a little. I opened my arms, loosening my ball of sadness, and submerged the small cat into another tight, loving embrace.

"This is why you're my best friend."

"I struggle."

"Thank you so much."

"Anytime, babe."

  

_Maybe things won't be so bad..._

_I should really try and open up to more people. Like Skyler._

_That way, when I give people a glimpse of what goes on in my own mind, I can seek out help._

_Thank you, Skyler._

_Claire Chloe Harper, The Princess, out._

# 23. SEARCH PARTY

\~~~

## Charlie

I sat before the dining table in my father's small LA apartment at nine in the morning.¬†

He hadn't moved out yet, but he was here in Cali today for the contracting.

My briefcase was open and set to the side and a hefty stack of blood-red tinted envelopes sat in clusters, all over the tabletop.

They were separated into two piles. The ones to the left of the table, I had opened and read, and the ones to the right, I had yet to read. It's been a few hours since I began, but I've already gotten through fifty-six letters. One hundred and thirty-one left to go. She left a total of one hundred and eighty-seven letters.

They weren't long. About one paragraph, five sentences, per letter. Some were longer, some were incredibly short. I blazed through some quicker than others and spent a while rereading certain letters.

The one I held in my hands had me particularly drawn to it.

I kept reading over those same few sentences.

**_...It reminded me of you, Charlie. It reminded me of that memory we had together, when I taught you how to ride that bike outside of your father's house. Well, I mean, not 'taught', but, you still rode that thing like a bird rides the wind. I was so proud of you. I wish I could've given you more memories like that. I'm so sorry I left you, Charles. If I could come back to get you, I would..._**

I closed my eyes and wiped the tears away before they could fall and ruin my face.

_Pull it together, Charlie..._

_Don't cry..._

_This was serious now._

_No more games. No more stalling._

_This was real._

_I was now searching for a lost identity._

_I was now searching for my mother._

"Hey, kid?" I heard my father enter the room, standing against the door frame that separated the kitchen from the living room. The moment I heard his voice, I contained myself, returning to my stronger, more defiant attitude. "How's it going?"

He seemed worried about me. I didn't pick my head up. I just glared at him by shifting my eyes sternly. He stood there awkwardly, holding a tray with a water pitcher and two glasses.

After a bit of hesitation, he made his way over to the circular table and sat down at the seat across from me. I sighed and shook my head, my eyes returning to the letter in my hands. My father then began to shift the pile on the right side of the table out of the way for the tray.

"Dad, what the hell?!" I snapped, grabbing ahold of the pile, shooing his hands away. I began to reorder it back into its original stack, exactly how it was before he ruined it.

"I'm sorry, I‚Äî" My dad stuttered, not knowing where to set the tray in his paws down.

"I'm in the middle of reading these, how am I supposed to find her if I'm getting distracted by you?" I snarled, adding a few last touches to the pile, straightening it.

"I... I was..."

"God, just leave me alone, okay?" I scowled, going back to the letter.

My father exhaled, _another failed attempt at getting closer to me_. He sat up from the chair with his tray, walking sullenly away. He set the tray down on the kitchen counter, which was right next to the table. The older husky just stood there, not doing anything. I could tell he didn't know whether to keep pushing or to leave me as I had asked. I was really hoping for the latter.

"What's so important about that letter?" He asked, staring at it in my hands. _Guess he really didn't adhere to my wishes._  

"Huh?" I asked, turning my head over to him.

"You seem very, uh, intrigued by it."

"It's nothing," I dismissed, folding it up and shoving it into my pocket. I leaned my arms against the table and stared at the wall ahead of me. "You know, the more I read these, the angrier I get at you," I scorned, shaking my head. "It all makes sense now, why we didn't have a funeral... Why there were no reports or news clippings about the crash... I always thought I was too old to remember such things back when I was eight, but no, you just flat out lied to me."

"Charlie, I‚Äî"

"What, you're sorry? You've said that a thousand times, you know I won't forgive you," I scoffed, rubbing my temples with my paw. "Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't have the ability. You don't lie about something like that, Hugo."

My father went quiet once again. He closed his eyes and sighed.

_God, everything he does annoys me... Every action, every sound he makes... I can't help but feel so much resentment towards him... His presence is like an itch on my body that I can't reach... He's so... He's..._

_I'm just so angry..._¬†

_I'm so angry..._

"Do you have a bulletin board?" I asked with an attitude, making sure he understood that I wouldn't ask him for anything, but this I needed.

My father nodded his head and turned around to leave the room.

"And some string?" I added.

  

Once he had gotten me the bulletin board and the string that I had requested, I got to work. I didn't want to become anything like those fake drama television detectives, but it was the only way for me to organize everything into a neat plot. With a few push pins and a bit of string, I began to connect all the letters I had read already into an intertwining web. It was a map to assemble my thoughts and create a timeline, if not, a story. _Where was my mother?_

"So, what I've gathered so far is," I talked to myself, even if Hugo was listening. He stood in the corner of the kitchen, watching me put together the pieces. "Mom, most likely, lives in a big suburban-urban city mix. She remarried and assumedly took her husband's last name, so that's probably why I couldn't find her when I searched her name up on Google. She's mentioned that her town is very large in mass and that she had driven across a substantial bridge once to drive into town, saying that it reminded her of the bridge near our house."

"Yes, I know, Charlie, like I said, I read the‚Äî"

"But, she also wrote that she 'wishes she could've moved to LA' and instead settled somewhere else in California. So, that confirms that she's in Cali, but not in LA. So, I'm thinking we start with San Francisco. There's a bridge, it's a suburban-urban town, it's a good place to start. We'll find her." I took in the sight of my organized board on the tabletop, feeling confidence.

"How? How are you gonna find her? What's your plan, Charlie?" My father interrogated me as I pulled my laptop out of my briefcase, opening up a search engine. "How are you going to find a single person in all of San Francisco in one single week?"

"I'm going to search up Mom's first name with San Francisco and write down all the addresses I can find. It's morning, so we'll have time to drive over and head to all of the addresses within the day."

"Charlie, that's a five-hour drive, there and back! How are we going to‚Äî"

"We'll make it work, alright?!" I growled, staring deeply at the computer screen. I began to search up what I had said I would on Google. I rapidly grabbed a notepad and began to hastily pen down all the websites and addresses I could find.

"What about Skyler? There's no way we'll make it back before dark, he'll worry about you."

"I'll just tell him I was being held late for filming. There were night scenes that needed to be shot," I rambled, frantically scribbling down every pocket of info I could find. I was so focused on noting the information that I didn't even pay attention to what I was saying. "Dad, get the keys, if we leave now, we'll be able to make it in time."

"Charlie, I have things to do!" Hugo whined, approaching me at the table. "I need to deal with the paperwork for the house, I need to get to work on the hotel! I don't have time for this!"

"You lied about my mother, now you have to pay the price!" I confronted him, standing up. We faced each other down, anger building as the tension between us increased. The table was the only thing separating us and stopping us from fighting, fists bloody. "You brought this upon yourself, Hugo. This is all your fault. You caused the problem, now you have to fix it."

I could hear a subtle growl come from deep within my father's throat.

"I can't leave, Charlie."

"You promised that you'd help me find her."

"I never promised you anything."

"Then I guess I'll do it by myself."

I slammed my laptop closed and shoved it into my briefcase along with the letters. I fiercely packed up my things and headed for the front door, storming past my father, the kitchen, and the living room.

"Charlie, stop! You'll only find yourself in more disappointment!" My father called, following and pursuing me to the door.

"It'll be better than any disappointment _you_ made me feel." I grabbed the doorknob, only for my father to grab my arm, halting me from opening the door and leaving.

"You won't find her," My father tried to convince me.

"I can try, Hugo. Unlike you."

"It'll only hurt you more, Charlie. I searched for her for so long. I found nothing."

"I'm not you."

"That's your biggest fear, isn't it?" My father intimidated me, closing in. "You don't want to be a part of this family, do you? You don't take pride in being a Cooperton?" Our faces came close to each other. This was his method, he wanted to scare me into stopping. _But I'm not afraid of him. Not anymore._¬†

"I wish I never was a part of this family. I wish I was never a part of you."

"You can't keep running away, Charlie. You can't keep denying that we are the same."  

"I'm nothing like you!"

"Prove it."

"You're a liar!"

"And you aren't? How come Skyler doesn't know about this, then?"

"I'm protecting him!"  

"You _think_ you're protecting him. I thought I was protecting you too. That only lead to more trouble, didn't it?"

"Skyler isn't like us. He's different."

"He may be. But, when it comes to a lie, how much of a difference will it make when he finds out you've been untruthful? He's the same. Just like you and me."

"Don't you fucking dare."

"We're the same, Charlie. Whether you like it or not!"

I had reached my boiling point. My whole body had surged with a raging anger that began to manifest physically and violently.

"SHUT UP!" I screamed, vigorously thrusting my shoulder into him, shoving the husky back. I opened the door and ran out of the apartment, racing down the hallway with my briefcase.

"YOU CAN'T KEEP RUNNING, CHARLIE!" I heard my father yell from his apartment as I escaped to the elevator.

I slammed the 'down' button a million times, waiting for the elevator doors to open. Once they did, I entered the elevator and frantically pressed for the lobby. The doors closed and the elevator began to decrease in levels.

I took the chance to catch my breath.

But, it wasn't the running that stifled my lack of oxygen.¬†

It was my emotions.

_Don't cry, Charlie. Don't cry._

I heard the sound of my breathing quicken and overstimulate.

_You're not a fucking child._

I grabbed the fur on my head and clenched it tightly, almost ripping the strands straight out of my skull.

_Get it together, motherfucker._

I heard a whine, a suffering moan, begin to accumulate from my vocal chords.

_Don't cry, you cunt._¬†

I was having an internalized panic attack.

_You fucking cunt._

I couldn't stop myself.

_Don't cry._

  

I broke.

I screamed and punched the wall of the elevator, right above the array of buttons.

I left a pathetic dent in the stainless steel surface.

In the reflective metal, I could see the warped reflection of my face.

_A failure. A fucking monster._

_Maybe I am like my father._

_Maybe I always was._

  

_I'll always be a Cooperton, no matter how hard I try not to._

The idea of taking a ten-hour-long trip in one day seemed absurd at first, but there was nothing holding me back. I was committed. I drove all the way over to San Francisco in under five hours. I took the quickest routes and speeded whenever I sought the chance. I drove across the Golden Gate Bridge and headed into the city, following my phone's satellite directions to the first address.¬†

It was 3 PM when I got there. The address was in an apartment complex. Once I had found myself at the right room in the immensely occupied building, I knocked on the door, waiting in anticipation to see a white, fluffy, female canine. The door opened, and the woman I believed to be my mother was a college student in her 20s. She was very confused by my presence.

Safe to say, the first address was definitely not my mother.¬†I crossed it off the list.

I apologized for the disturbance, got back into my car, and drove to the next closest address. It was a brownstone this time. I repeated the same method: I knocked on the front door and waited for the tenant. The woman who owned this address was a cougar with a husband and three kids. I crossed her address off of the list.

The next address was an eighty-year-old woman. I scribbled the location off immediately when she answered the door.¬†

The next one on the list wasn't even a female, just a middle-aged man who went by the same name as my mother's. I instantaneously crossed that address out, too.

I had five addresses left and it had already taken an hour or two to drive, back and forth, across the seven-mile-wide-city to visit all of the different locations. Though I was making good time, my spirits were declining with each wrong address I encountered.

Five more locations were remaining. Five more possible chances.

_C'mon, Charlie... You'll find her..._

_She's gotta at least be in one of these..._

Five: I drove. I knocked on the door. It wasn't her.

Four:¬†I drove. I knocked on the door. It wasn't her.

Three:¬†I drove. I knocked on the door. It wasn't her.

Two:¬†I drove. I knocked on the door. It wasn't her.

There was only one more address left.

_This one has to be it._

I drove away from the current location and set directions for the final one. The sky was growing dark and cloudy, and little droplets of rain were splattering over the windshield. I didn't think too much of it until I heard the thunder. After looking up at the jacked-up sky, I knew a storm was on its way. My car was also running low of gas, so if I didn't get there quick, I would be screwed.

But, if the address was my mother, it didn't matter. I'd have somewhere to stay the night.

I drove for about fifteen minutes and found myself pulling up in front of a genuine, petite Italianate row house in the middle of a more suburban-styled part of the city. It was painted a light baby blue and had a cherry blossom tree blooming on the sidewalk out in front. It gave off a happy aura, like something positive was lying in wait for me.

Before heading out, I closed my eyes and clasped my paws together.

_Please, please..._

_Please, let this one be right..._

I opened my car door and walked out into the sprinkling rain. The sky was darkened with stormy clouds. It would soon be pouring, but if this address was my mother's, then I wouldn't care at all.

I walked onto the damp sidewalk and made my way up the long staircase that lead to the front door. The rain began to soak the top of my head, but I didn't seem to feel it. I felt a small grin form onto my face.

_This could be it._

I approached the door and took a deep breath.

_Please..._

_Please, Mom..._

I knocked on the door.

I stepped back and brushed my paw through the fur on my head, wanting to make a good first impression. I felt the rush of excitement and fear slide over me as I waited.

_I'm here, Mom..._

_Your son is right here..._

The door had opened.

  

It was a vixen.

I felt my hope-filled smile deflate like a balloon.

I didn't remember my mother being a fox.¬†

Or being old enough to be my twin sister.

"Hello?" She asked timidly, not knowing who I was.

Sadly, I did not know who she was either.

_I wanted so badly to know who was in front of me..._

_I wanted so badly to jump into their arms and cry into their shoulder..._

_I wanted..._

_I..._

I didn't say a thing.¬†

I just stared at the poor woman, not knowing what to do.

"Yes?" She questioned again, trying to get something out of me.

_It wasn't her..._

_I searched throughout the entire city and I didn't find her..._

"Who are you?" The woman seemed a little frightened by my presence.

Here I was, causing another disturbance.

I looked at the floor.

I turned around and began to walk away.

I tried to say something as I left, but it only came out as a silent mutter.

"I'm sorry."

I heard her close the door behind me promptly.

  

The rain came down hurriedly.

My entire body became drenched in the water like a shower.

_I couldn't tell if it was the weather... or my own tears falling from my face._

_Maybe a mix of both._

I got back into my car and sat in the driver's seat.

I didn't feel angry. I didn't even feel sad.

I felt nothing.

No feelings at all, whatsoever.

I just sat in the seat, listening to the phythmic sound of the rain as it tapped repeatedly against the car roof and windows.

It was hypnotic. I almost shifted into a trance.

I felt like static. My mind was a buzzing space of void.

I was like a lifeless husk. A mindless zombie.

  

_Dad was right..._

_Maybe I never will find her..._

_He searched for her for fifteen years..._¬†

_Who's to say I won't be looking for the same amount of time, if not longer?_

  

_Me and my father..._

_We are the same..._

_Liars, cheats..._

  

_There's no point in running away from the truth._

I reached into my pocket and slowly retrieved my phone. I tiredly opened my contacts and scrolled down the list, moving with sloth from the exhaustion of today's treasure hunt, finding the one contact in my whole phone that was starred.

I opened Skyler's contact and stared at the photo of him.

"Sky..." I whispered to myself.

My finger hovered over the call button.

_Just tell him the truth, Charlie..._

I pressed down on the call icon and held the phone up to my ear.¬†

It began to ring.

I exhaled and accepted my fate.

Skyler answered.

"Hey, you!" The familiar and comforting voice said with his usual cheery voice.

I couldn't help but smile a bit.

_Skyler... I love him... So much..._

"Hi, sweetheart, um‚Äî"

"‚ÄîHey, so, I'm sorry that I'm not at home, I took my bike over to Claire and Jonathan's place just to check in on them, and now there's a storm outside. Like, a really bad one. Apparently, it won't pass until one in the morning, so I think I'm gonna have to spend the night. I'm really sorry that we couldn't do the little thing we planned for tonight, I would've really loved that."

"O-oh..." I mumbled. _I was so focused on searching for my mother that I had forgotten all about that..._ "Yeah... No, don't worry. It's okay."

"Are you sure?"

"I'm fine, Sky. It's all good."

"I can try and bike home in the rain if you want?"

"No, I don't want you getting hurt. Stay the night, I'll be okay."

"If you say so..." Skyler sighed. "I guess I'll see you tomorrow, then? When you're done with work? I don't think I'll be able to come over that early in the morning," He told me with a slight chuckle.

"Yeah, definitely. I'll see you tomorrow."

"Okay. Thank you," He giggled.¬†

"No need. Get a good rest, okay?"

"You got it," I couldn't see, but I could tell he was smiling. Just by the tone of his voice. "Hey, I love you, alright?"

"I love you, too, Skyler."

  

A strike of lightning and the phone line went dead.

I sat in my car, unmoving.

I saw the reflection of my face in the windshield.

  

_You don't even have a choice._

_You're not choosing to lie to Skyler..._

_You're just incapable of telling him the truth._

_Because you're afraid._

  

_Don't cry._

_Don't cry, Charlie, don't cry._

_Don't cry..._

# 24. BODY AND MIND

\~~~

## Skyler

"Yeah, it's looking pretty bad out there, maybe you should call Charlie and tell him you're staying here tonight," Claire suggested, her fingers just lightly peeling back the curtains of her bedroom window, peeking out at the stormy mess.

"Are you sure?" I wondered, a little nervous as I was impatient to get home to Charlie. But then, a blinding flash of lightning and a boom of voracious thunder caused me to flinch and cower into a ball. _I really do have the instincts of a feline..._ "Yeah, okay..."

"You're not biking all the way home in that storm, Sky, it's dangerous," Claire warned, sitting down on the bed next to me. "Charlie would be furious with me if I let you do that."

"Where would I even sleep?" I asked, sitting on the edge of their bed awkwardly. "Doesn't Becca have the guest room?"

"Well, I can probably convince Jonathan to sleep on the couch with me if you wanna take our bed‚Äî"

"N-no, no! I'm not doing that," I whined, shaking my head anxiously.

"Well, do you want the couch?"

"I'll take it if it makes me less of a bother."

"Oh, shush, Sky," She giggled, patting my head and sitting up, heading over to her closet, which stood to the left side of the bed. "I'll get you some pajamas, cutie." She opened the sliding, foldable white panels and revealed the large array of clothing, attached to multi-colored hangers. She began to rifle through them, finding something comfortable for me to sleep in.

Suddenly, I felt a buzzing in my pocket along with the muffled sound of a ringtone. I reached into the pocket of my pants and retrieved my phone.

_Oh, shit. It's Charlie._

_He's probably calling because I'm not at home._  

"Um, Charlie's calling, can I step outside really quickly?"

"You don't need to ask, go ahead." She shooed me away with her paw.

I sharply exhaled through my nose as a response and sat up, heading for the door to the hallway. Once I had gotten on the other side of it, I closed it shut and stared at the screen of my phone, displaying Charlie's contact photo, which was a selfie of him. I was in the selfie as well, but I cropped my face out because I didn't like the way I looked.

I tapped against the green call icon and held the phone up to my ear.  

_He's probably confused why I wasn't at home. Worse, he might be worried about me._

_It seemed like he was really looking forward to that thing tonight, I hope this doesn't put him in a bad mood._

"Hey, you!" I chirped, wanting to break the news as lightly as possible.

"Hi, sweetheart, um‚Äî"

"‚ÄîHey, so, I'm sorry that I'm not at home, I took my bike over to Claire and Jonathan's place just to check in on them, and now there's a storm outside. Like, a really bad one," I began to pace up and down the hallway, a little anxious. "Apparently, it won't pass until one in the morning, so I think I'm gonna have to spend the night. I'm really sorry that we couldn't do the little thing we planned for tonight, I would've really loved that," I winced, hoping he wouldn't be upset.

"O-oh... Yeah... No, don't worry. It's okay."

"Are you sure?"

"I'm fine, Sky. It's all good."

"I can try and bike home in the rain if you want?"

"No, I don't want you getting hurt. Stay the night, I'll be okay."

"If you say so..." I sighed, relieved he wasn't upset, but I was also concerned. There was something in his voice that seemed off. _I mean, he's been acting off these past few days..._ "I guess I'll see you tomorrow, then? When you're done with work? I don't think I'll be able to come over that early in the morning," I said with an awkward chuckle.

"Yeah, definitely. I'll see you tomorrow."

"Okay. Thank you," I giggled.

"No need. Get a good rest, okay?"

"You got it," I smiled, happy to be talking with Charlie, even if I was a bit worried. "Hey, I love you, alright?"

"I love you, too, Skyler."

Suddenly, a flash of lightning struck once more, and the whole house lost power.

I instantly turned my head up towards the ceiling light above me. The bulb had fizzled out with a pop. The phone line went dead the moment my surroundings went dark, the only light source being the subtle illumination of the cloudy afternoon sky, peering through the windows.

"Shit!" I heard Claire exclaim from beyond the doorway. I hurriedly grabbed the door handle and entered back into their bedroom. As I did, the fox rushed out, passing me by. "Let me find the backup generator, one sec, Sky."

"What about Becca?" I called as she fled. "Is she still asleep?"

"I'll check on her, too!" Claire replied as she disappeared down the hall.

I nodded my head and closed the door behind her. I turned around, trying to find my bearings in the darkness of the bedroom. The window allowed for some brightness, but not much. I looked over at the bed, vividly detecting the outline of the pajamas she found for me, laid down on the sheets orderly. I looked back at the door, and then back at the pajamas. I decided to try them on while Claire was out.

Once I had dressed in them, I immediately felt colder than usual. I could tell that they weren't my preferred long-sleeve, cover-up clothing, which made me a little nervous. I walked over to Jonathan and Claire's tall mirror in the corner of their room. It was dark, so I could only see the blackened silhouette of my body in front of the glowing-white window.

That was when the power came back on.

  

That was also when I realized how _revealing_ the pajamas were.

They were a pair of white shorts and a white short-sleeve T-shirt. My arms and legs were uncovered and bare, visible for all of the world to see. The shorts ran down to my thighs and left the rest of my legs unprotected. The t-shirt could almost be a crop top, unable to cover most of my thin torso. I've never shown this much fur, ever.

I suddenly felt exposed. It was like a surge of fear and panic rushed over me all at once, a chill coursing through my veins. I desperately tried my best to hide myself, frantically covering my arms and legs with my paws, but it wasn't doing anything at all.

I saw my reflection.

_I looked so skinny._

_And so frail._

_My limbs were reminiscent of a skeleton. My waist was far too thin. My fur was vibrantly obtrusive and confusing._¬†

_I looked like a cartoon character._  

_I looked so ugly._

_I hated my body._

I clasped my arms around me, cradling myself. I attempted to channel my breathing, but the sight of me in the mirror... _Scared and alone, weak and fragile..._ I couldn't take my eyes off of it, no matter how badly I wanted to look away.

I began to get flashbacks to times where I felt fear like this.

_High school... College..._

_I thought I was over this... I thought I had learned how to control the way I saw myself and the way it made me feel... but I still haven't._

_I haven't changed at all. Not one bit._

_I'm still that shy, closeted kitten that Charlie tried his best to heal._

I heard Claire's footsteps come back down the hallway and I began to freak out. I couldn't change back into my normal clothes that quickly.

My anxiety came to a spike and I didn't know what to do.

I fell to the floor and whimpered, crumbling into a ball, sitting against the bed frame. _She was just going to have to see me like this. I have nowhere else to go._

"Fixed it!" Claire entered the room and set her sights on me, sitting on the floor. Her expression changed from happy to abrupt concern. "Hey, Sky, you okay?" She asked, lunging forward and leaning down onto her knees in front of me.

"D-do you have anything less r-revealing?" I asked, muffled, hiding my face behind my arms as I hugged myself tightly, not wanting to let go.

"I-I have Jonathan's pajamas, h-he never wears them, but I think they're too big for you," Claire spoke with a calming voice, trying not to freak me out even more. I could tell she was frightened by my unexpected panic attack. She shifted and sat on the floor beside me.

"Maybe I'll just sleep in my clothes," I mumbled.

"Sky, what's wrong?" Claire asked, giving off a sweetness that only she could emanate.

I didn't say a thing. It wasn't because I didn't want to, I just didn't know _what_ to say. But, something about Claire's welcoming expression, evocative of a mother's love, made it feel like she knew exactly what was up and how to empathize. She touched my shoulder and leaned in.

"Are you self-conscious about your body?" She asked below her breath, hitting the nail on the head.

"I guess," I responded absent-mindedly, not wanting to lie. "...How did you know?"

"Please, I've had those same feelings my whole life," She shared, allowing for a moment of intimacy between us. "It's normal to not like your appearance, Sky. What's troubling you?"

"I... I..." I began to hesitate, not knowing where to start.

"It's okay if you don't want to talk about it, babe. Just know that I'm here to help, whenever you're ready."

I turned my attention up to her caring, warm gaze, looking down kindly on me. Earlier, I was the one comforting her. Now, it was Claire's turn. If she could trust me with her issues, I can trust her with mine. It's always been that way. We've always had that friendship.

_She's Claire. My go-to whenever I'm having problems that I can or can't come to Charlie about._

I took a deep breath and spoke the truth. "I look so pathetic," I whispered, staring at the mirror that stood in the corner. _I'm afraid to look at my reflection again._ "I'm so small... and so skinny and weak... I hate how tiny I look."

"Is... Is this why you never wear anything short or tight?"

"It started in high school. People said I looked... feminine."

"And how did you feel about that?"

"I didn't know what to feel, but... the way they said it, I... I believed it was something to be ashamed of."

Claire sighed and nodded her head, placing her paws on my arm. She tapped it lightly, accepting my answer and respecting to leave it as is. "Let me find you something else to wear, okay?"

"Thank you," I nodded back.

Claire sat up and went back over to the closet, committing a deep search. She passed me a few comforting side-glances, letting me know that she wasn't far in the slightest.

I looked over at the mirror in the corner, its image haunting me. The reflection was not displaying mine, but any step further and it would.

_Maybe... if I looked one more time..._

All of a sudden, I found my body sitting up from the floor, escaping the ball I had rolled into. My bare legs and feet made their way towards the mirror, much to my displeasure.

There are times where my body performs actions that I don't necessarily want. To clarify, it locks down and loses feeling at the worst moments, for example, the times I was assaulted and raped. My body becomes too afraid to act and just gives up. I become a ragdoll.

But, this time, it wouldn't stop moving. I walked back over to the mirror and stood in front of it. I saw my reflection once again.

_I hated it, but, I couldn't stop staring. I couldn't move. I just stood there, standing in place._

_I_¬†_looked so different in my mind. I_¬†_looked so different from the image I always believed I portrayed._

_Which, actually, never existed. I never focused on my image, I just focused on who I was. It didn't matter if I was tall, short, big, small, masculine, feminine..._

"Hey, Sky, look," I heard Claire's voice call for me.

I turned my head and saw her holding up a certain article of clothing. But, not just any piece of clothing.

It was a dress. But, something about it seemed strikingly familiar.

After a few more seconds of analyzing the decorative flower pattern and pink frills, I finally realized what it was. It was that dress I saw in the mall. The one I was intensely attracted to.

"You bought it?" I gasped.

"You suggested it," Claire chuckled. She walked over to my side, looking down at the dress as she made her way over to me. "But for some reason, I got it in a size much smaller than my actual fitting, so sadly, I can't wear it."

I nodded my head and looked back at the mirror as Claire approached my side. Next to her, I felt even worse about my appearance.

_She looked so beautiful. She was like an angel without wings._

_Jonathan was a lucky man._

_I wish I could've looked that way for Charlie, but_‚Äî  
  
  

The thoughts running through my head immediately came to a jolting stop as Claire performed a certain action.

She held the dress before my body, lining the shoulder straps up to the top of my torso.

In the mirror, Claire's placement of the dress fed the illusion of me wearing it.

"Looks good on you," She complimented, staring at the reflection with a small smile. "You wanna put it on?"

"Wha... Claire..." I stumbled, my face completely frozen and reddening like a tomato.

"You wore a dress for Halloween once, this is nothing different."

"W-why? Are... Are you sure?" I asked below my breath, turning around and facing her.  

"Change into it real quick while I get something, I'll look away, I promise," Claire told me, handing me the dress and walking back over to the closet. She searched it for the 'something' she spoke of, facing the opposite direction.

I looked down at the dress in my paws, wondering if I should take up Claire's offer.

_I mean... I have worn one before... And I did like it..._  
  
  

After a swift change of clothes, I tiptoed back up to the mirror and looked at my reflection. The pink floral-patterned dress was tailored to my exact build and matched the pastel color scheme of my fur. The shoulder straps and bodice fit my torso perfectly, seemingly like a bra that covered my chest accordingly. The skirt and flounce ran all the way down to my feet and gave off a cute, innocent, endearing aura, but also hinted at a secretive, more slender and sensual tone.

_I... I don't look so awful like this..._

_My arms and shoulders are visible, but... something feels different about it..._

_I feel more... comfortable._

_Comfortable in my body._

"Aww, you look so cute," Claire squealed, walking into the mirror's reflection. Her sudden appearance caused me to blush and jitter, a new side of me revealed to my close friend. "Here, now try this..."

In Claire's paws, she held a brunette wig. My eyes widened at the sight of it, understanding her plan. I decided to let her go through with it.

She began to fit the wig onto the top of my head, ruffling it and adjusting it to the right fitting. She pulled it over my forehead and split little crevices into some of the strands for my pointy ears to poke through. She brushed the fake hair down a few times with her paws, flattening the disordered threads as it was sitting in a messy closet for a while. The wig had straight, brown strands, but grew more curly and thicker near the ends. It was a relatively short cut, reaching my shoulders, with the added touch of bangs across my forehead.

_I looked entirely different._

_But, I... I looked better._

"Hm..." Claire mumbled, taking in the sight of me, mentally marrying together my physical appearance with the feminine touches; the dress and the long hair. "...Nah."

She then removed the wig from my head and sprinted back over to the closet.

"W-what..?" I stuttered, caught off guard by the action. I liked the way it looked.

"Bangs don't really work on you. And the brown doesn't match your fur _or_ the dress. Let me find you something different."

"O-oh..." I faltered, still trying to keep up with what was happening around me. The moment was moving so quickly, I hadn't had any time to process it.

I mean, I admired the wig, but if Claire said it didn't fit, I'll follow her lead.

Claire returned to my side with a dirty blonde wig; brown at the roots, golden all the rest of the way down. The strands were wavy and frizzy and reached my shoulders once again. Claire rested her arms on my shoulders, analyzing the reflection once more.

I smiled just a little. I approved of all the looks she was testing out, but Claire was undecided.

"Uhh... It's hard, 'cause, like, what hair color pairs best with pink and blue?"

"What about... pink and blue..?"

"No, that would look weird and unnatural, it needs to have some contrast," Claire returned to the drawing board‚ÄîA.K.A. the closet‚Äîwith the blonde wig. "But, maybe we can try a very, very light pink."

She came back with a seemingly white-colored wig with only trace amounts of subtle pink. I stood still, ready for her to place it onto my scalp. She layered it on top and brushed her fingers through the long strands, pulling some of them behind my back and a few before my chest, where the strands ended. It was a longer cut, but not long enough to look abnormal.

"This is brighter and has a color that matches both your fur and your dress. It doesn't look strange or unnatural, it fits you," Claire spoke. I could see what she meant in the reflection.

It looked right. It didn't feel like an incorrect size or made my head bigger, it just worked. It worked well.

"Let me try this, too," She mumbled to herself, grabbing a few strands from either opposite side of my head and tugging a hair tie from her wrist. She tied it around the two strands and tightened it all the way up to the top of my head, symbolizing a small ponytail even though most of the hair was down.

Finished with her work, she stood back and admired the reflection.

I stared at the image of myself, my nerves and anxiety at ease. My body began to take a few steps forward, closing in on the mirror. I've never felt this connected to my appearance before.

I grabbed the ends of the dress, holding it up with two fingers. I looked down at my outfit, finding joy in the way it moved so lightly. With a giggle, I spun around in a small circle, the wig's hair and the skirt's material flowing through the wind. I felt like I was walking on air.

_I liked it. I liked the way I looked. I liked the way I felt._

_I liked it._

I stopped and stumbled a bit on my feet, dizzy from the spinning. I chuckled and found my balance, staring back at the mirror. Claire stepped up right behind me and wrapped her arms around my torso, resting her chin on my shoulder. She hugged me tightly from behind, smiling and giggling. I couldn't help but smile widely along with her.

"Maybe... femininity isn't such a bad thing?" She spoke.

I slowly lost my smile and stared at the floor.

"So..." Claire began with a different tone, a more sincere and interrogative one. "...Is there something we should talk about, Sky?"

I kept staring at the floor.

"I dunno..." I murmured.

Claire stood back and grabbed my shoulders. She spun me around slowly, turning my body away from the mirror and facing her body. She touched the tip of her finger to the bottom of my chin, tilting my head upwards towards hers.

By the sound of her voice, the expression on her face, and the look in her eyes, I knew the next thing that would come out of her mouth would be serious.  

"Do you think... there's a possibility... that you might be transgender..?"  
  
  

I turned my head back down at the floor and stayed there.

I couldn't say a thing. I couldn't even think.

_I wanted... so badly... to forget about those concerns I had about myself..._

_But, Claire had asked me, verbally and physically. It wasn't only in my mind now._

_It was real._

"I..."

_What should I say?_

"I don't..."

_Do I even know the answer?_

"I don't know."

_Shit... You're crying, Skyler.._.

I looked back up at Claire, my eyes filled with tears, streaming down the sides of my face. Claire took one glance at the sadness on my face and immediately rushed to my aid.

"Hey..." She whimpered, clasping both of her paws to my cheeks, closing in. "Oh, Sky..."

"I-I... I've always questioned my g-gender identity," I stuttered over and over while crying. My voice was high-pitched and my breathing was uncontrollable. My words sounded sloppy and all over the place, but I tried my best. I needed her to know what I was going through, even if it took all of my might to say it. "I s-suspected it for so long... But, I... I... I was always so afraid that it would be true..." I began to tug on the frills of the dress as a coping mechanism. "I never wanted to find out, s-so I just ignored every feeling and every thought... C-Claire... I'm so scared it might be true..."

The more I choked over my words, the more saddened Claire looked. "Why are you afraid, Skyler?" She caressed my face, trying to soothe my trembling nerves.

"I-I... I was bullied so much in high school about it, I was afraid it would make me a bigger target, to both harassment and sexual assault... I don't know... I'm just afraid of how I'd be treated if I really was..." I confessed, trying to wipe my tears away, but they kept coming down, no matter how hard I tried. They flooded my face. They dripped into my mouth. They streamed down my neck and dribbled all over the floor beneath us.

"Skyler, other people's opinions should not be a part of what you want."

"I don't want to get hurt. I don't want to get hurt again." I shook my head repeatedly, quaking and quivering. My paws were vibrating like crazy, they wouldn't stop. My foot kept rapping against the floor. My knees were weak and shivering. I felt more fragile now than I've ever been before.

"You won't. You have people who love you and are protecting you. Charlie, me." She brushed her paw against my head, petting the hair of the wig as if it were a real part of my body. "Speaking of, have you talked to Charlie about this?"

I shook my head, unable to answer with words.

"How come?"

"I dunno... I... He's been distant lately..."

"What do you mean?"

"He's felt... _far_ from me... I don't know if that's my fault or a personal thing, but... I'm scared he's getting bored of me."

"Why would he ever get bored of you?"

"Well... I've constantly been a burden to him with my emotions and... I've been refusing to have sex with him..."

"Wait, is he forcing you to‚Äî"

"No, no, of course not, he actually hasn't asked in years, but... I know he wants to have sex with me... and I feel so bad about it..."

"Is your PTSD what's stopping you?"

"I don't know, I think?"

"You think?"

I shrugged. I turned around and looked back at the mirror.

"It's, just... It's all so... confusing... There are so many factors that go into me losing my virginity to Charlie... First of all, the multitude of questions that I have for myself, like... am I, you know..."

"...Fuckable?" Claire scoffed, making me laugh a little through the tears and the trembling.

"Yeah... Would Charlie enjoy having sex with me? Would he like my body? My reactions? The way he has sex with me?"

"I think the question you should be asking is 'would I enjoy it?'" Claire filled in the blanks, making me rethink the things I've come to fear. _Maybe it was much simpler than I've believed._

"And... secondly, I can't even get turned on. I don't know if it's the medications I'm taking or... my emotional capability to even _get_ turned on... but it just won't work..."

"Maybe, it's your PTSD that's holding you back."

"Claire, I... I don't think I have PTSD."

"Hm?" Claire questioned.

"I don't think I have PTSD anymore. I think I stopped having it, almost, a year ago."

"What do you mean?" Claire's expression became confused. _My PTSD was a huge part of my vulnerability. How could I be so fragile if I didn't have PTSD anymore?_

"Yes, I've still been having seizures and night terrors, but... the image of that wolf is long gone. It's just my brain trying to find ways to fight against me. I've been denying Charlie sex for four years, not _only_ because of my sleep paralysis, but because... I'm scared."

"Oh, hon, I know you're scared‚Äî"

"No, you‚Äîyou don't understand..." I wiped the tears from my eyes, drying my face and my fur. I turned around and faced Claire with strength. "I'm... A long time ago... when Charlie and I first started dating... I told him how afraid I was of romance and sex and marriage... I'm still... scared of... _commitment_. I've always been. I'm scared that, if I give my body away to Charlie, then it's all over. It solidifies our relationship and nothing will ever be the same again."

"Isn't... Isn't that good?"

"It may seem that way, but all my life, I've been afraid of loving something all because of my fear of finality. That, when we make love, we will forever be intertwined, whether we like it or not."¬†

_I've never admitted this before, but with today's circumstances, it feels like the right time._¬†_This was an area of vulnerability that's been in my life for the longest time. Even though Charlie and I seem like star-crossed lovers, this fear... this idea... has never left my conscious. And I've been no short of guilt._

"There are so many things I regret doing, and this can't be another one. I can't do that to Charlie, it would break him, but most importantly, it would break me. When we started dating, I avoided anything close to a real, authentic relationship. But then, we fell in love. For real. I introduced him to my parents... he became a part of my family... and we continued to be in love for the next four years with only some mishaps, but overall, it's been good. Very good. Incredibly, magically, beautifully good. Things took a larger step forward when he asked me to move in with him. Sure, I was hopeful. I believed that this would help, that this would open my eyes, but... it's all been so tough. Our relationship has never been this rocky. I, just... I wish I could go back. Back to my first year of college, where Charlie and I had just started dating. That was it for me. That was all I needed. I was happy, in love, nothing else was necessary to convince me. I wish we could've stayed like that, though. In that state of happiness. We both were trying something new and it was exciting, we were happy and young and thriving... But, time passed, and things got... _way_ more complex. I... I just want to stay in that state forever. Where we were just trying things out and the future wasn't a thought in our minds. I don't want to get older, I want to stay in the past, I don't want it to leave us, because, if it does, and I lose my virginity to him, I give everything up. I sell my soul to Charlie, and we grow up. And growing up is terrifying. Growing up means exploring the dark parts of yourself that you swore to avoid. Growing up means facing your demons and conquering them. I'm not ready to grow up. I'll crush under the weight of pressure and stress, I'll lose everything to the darkness. I'm too weak. I'm a coward. I'll lose Charlie. I'll lose him, I'll lose you, I'll lose Calico, my family, my art, my life. I'll lose it all because I was too scared to commit. I was too scared to give in. I was too scared to live."

  

_When I had gone quiet, I realized..._

_I had gone through that whole monologue without a single tear._¬†

_Not a single whimper or whine._

_I hadn't cried. I hadn't breathed heavily or stuttered or..._

_I just said it. All together._

_For the first time._

"Skyler..." Claire moaned, leaning in. "Do you remember that thing you said a while ago?"

"What thing?"

"The thing your mother told you? That piece of advice you used to live by?"

"The... um... huh?" I searched my mind for anything that would ring a bell, but I could recall nothing.

Claire closed her eyes and sighed.

"That life was like... baking a cake?"

"Oh... yeah, that."

Claire gave me a look.

My mother's advice contradicted everything I had said. And Claire knew that I knew that. She patted my shoulder, confident in believing she didn't have to elaborate any further. She knew that I understood what her point was right away. There was nothing more she could've said. She was right.

"You wanna take a break?" She brushed her paws against my shoulders, rubbing my fur up and down.

"Yes, please..."

"Alright, let me get you out of this thing." Claire began to find a way to pull the wig off of me. That was until I grabbed her hands, stopping her from removing the hair.

"Wait," I hesitated, holding her paws away and letting go. "I... I like it..."

"You do?"

"I... I feel better in it..."

"You _do_..?" Claire gave me another look as if what I just said was confirmation enough of my gender identity.

"Yeah... I feel... I don't look weird... It fits my appearance... my body..."

"But, does it fit you?" Claire touched the sides of my arms, coming closer.

"I... I need more time to think about that..."

Claire nodded her head and exhaled slowly through her nose. Her eyes rolled downwards, caught in the middle of a thought.

Claire then perked her head upwards at me. Our eyes connected and I could feel the excitement she displayed in her expression.

"Hey, I have an idea," She beamed, making me feel welcomed into her bubble of happiness once again. "Tomorrow, you, me, and Becca, we'll go to the mall and we'll try on a bunch of different clothes together. And we'll see what fits _you_, not your body, alright? We'll find out if you are... or aren't..." She left the sentence open for my brain to finish. "...Does that sound good?"

I nodded my head and turned back around. I looked back at my reflection in the mirror.

_Was that really who Skyler was?_

_Were they really a... female at heart?_

"I'm scared to find out..." I admitted, staring at myself. "I mean, if it's true, then I've been lying to myself. About my identity. I don't even know... if I have one..."

"You do, Sky. It's just a little lost at the moment. We'll search for it. And we'll find it. Tomorrow, okay?"

"And if I am..." I looked back at Claire, who made eye contact with me. "...transgender..? What do I do..?"

"That's your decision to make."

\~~~

The sky had gone dark as the night grew nearer. Jonathan had returned home safely as the storm raged on. The muffled sound of raindrops hitting the roof echoed throughout the entire house, similar to the sound of white noise. Jonathan also tried to convince me to take their bedroom, but I declined passionately.

I got situated on the couch that stood in the living room, staring out at the backyard. Claire had closed off the wide entrance with a slideable window pane of glass, allowing for no rain to come inside and make a swampy mess of the house's beautiful interior. She couldn't find anything better to wear for pajamas, so I made the fateful decision to sleep in my tee and jeans. I had more than enough space on the couch, considering my small size compared to the wideness of the sofa. I leaned a pillow up against the right armrest of the couch and laid my head against it. Claire came in with Jonathan and handed me a blanket.

"Thanks, guys," I yawned, throwing the blanket over me, melting into the warmth of it. I felt at home in a house that wasn't mine.

"Are you sure you don't want the bedroom?" Jonathan reassured one last time.

"I'm sure," I responded with a smile. "I cannot thank you guys enough for letting me stay the night."

"Are you kidding? We're your best friends. There's no need to thank us," Claire scoffed as if it were obvious.

"Still," I chuckled. "Goodnight, guys."

"Goodnight, Sky. Get a good rest," Jonathan dismissed.

Claire came close and petted the fur on the top of my head. She leaned down and kissed my forehead softly, giving me a comforting look along with a small wink. I grinned slightly from the action as she backed away, leaving me to sleep. She left with Jonathan walking beside her. He put his arm around her waist as she yawned, resting her head on his shoulder.

_They really are in love, no matter how much strife they may go through when Claire tells Jonathan what had happened with Becca. I know they'll get through it._

Once they had entered back into their room and the door had slammed shut, I instantly got out from under the covers.

I tiptoed my way down the hallway and searched for the guest room. The cold tiled floor hitting my bare feet sent shivers throughout my body. I quickly reached the door to the guest room and carefully and quietly placed my paw on the handle.

I opened the door, slow as to not make a sound, and examined my surroundings. I saw a bed, a lump forming underneath the blankets.

Becca's head laid peacefully on the pillow, her face pointing in the opposite direction of mine. I could only see the back of her head. She must've been asleep all day.¬†

_I guess that's what a hangover does to wolves like her. Or shame. Or regret._

_I know I'd be lying in bed all day if I felt as embarrassed as she did._

I closed the door behind me and carefully crept into the bed, crawling under the sheets.

Becca's head shifted a little from the movement on the mattress. She sensed my presence.

Becca then turned around, looking at me.

Her eyes met mine.

I made myself comfortable, shifting firmly underneath the warm blankets and the fluffy pillows. She was surprised, yet, pleasured by my appearance.

I gave her a small smile.

She smiled back.

That was all.

I laid my paw on her shoulder and shifted in closer to her.

I hugged her.

She hugged me back.

We both laid there, hugging each other in the bed.

It was dead silent. It was calm.

It was only the two of us.

And it was enough.

  

Before either of us knew it, we were both fast asleep.

# 25. ALIYAH

\~~~

## Charlie

_My eyes were closed._

_I could hear the sound of a wind chime softly jingling in the subtle breeze that swept the surrounding area I was lying down in. It brushed through the neighboring trees, the delicate noise of colliding leaves in the distance. It brushed through the short, thin needles of grass that surrounded me, blowing past my face and the tufts of fur that covered my body._

_I could feel a hand petting my forehead, lightly caressing the fur between my ears with gentle strokes, back and forth, as not to disturb the peace._

_I loved the way her touch felt. It was like home. A feeling I could confide in for the rest of my life._

_I opened my eyes, blinded by the sun in the blue sky, not a cloud in sight. The sun was only partly blocked by her long locks of hair as she stared into the distance above. She sat in the field of grass with me, not saying a word. She must've thought I was asleep. She just kept rubbing my head, back and forth, as she looked ahead, lost in the quiet tranquility._

_She was wearing a white dress, a sunflower stitched into the fabric in the middle of her chest. The wind I had loved so much to describe was making its way through her hair and tenderly ruffling the loose parts of her dress._

_She was beautiful. Even at age seven, I knew she was beautiful._

_"Mommy?" I spoke up, breaking the silence._

_She looked down on me, blocking the sun with her head. A smile spread across her face as she leaned in, noticing that I was awake._

_"Hi, cupcake," She grinned with a soft voice._

_We were both tired from the long day spent in our backyard, playing pretend and imagining future worlds. The tickle fight she had with me really took it out of us. Our day alone together was spent well. Soon, my father would be back from his business trip and things would be different. I always loved it when it was just us._

_"How come daddy can be scary sometimes?" I asked my mother, focusing my attention on picking at the loose string of my t-shirt._

_My mother sighed and looked back up into the distance, finding the right words to say._

_"Well, Charles, your father can be... challenging sometimes."_

_"What do you mean?"_

_"I... Well..." My mother shifted, leaning in closer as if we had our own private bubble. "He's a father, Charlie. He has a lot of duties and responsibilities. Just like you, but... more. He's an adult." I looked up at her, noticing the emotion she tried to hide in her face. "He goes through a lot of things sometimes. We just have to give him his space, alright?"_

_I nodded my head and looked away. It wasn't the answer I expected. Or wanted. Or believed._

_And from the look on my mother's face, I don't think she believed it herself either._

_"Hey," My mom spoke up, using her two fingers to turn my head back over to hers. "Look, one day... you'll meet someone... and you'll fall in love... and you'll start your own family. And become a father. Then you might understand what he's going through."_

_I sighed and kept fiddling with the loose string. "But... I wouldn't... yell at my family... or be aliyah... or hurt them... Why does daddy do those things to you, mommy?"_

_"You... You've seen..." She froze, caught off-guard. "Wait... 'aliyah'?"_

_"Yeah, he's aliyah." My mother kept looking at me with confusion. "I heard you yelling at him one night, calling daddy 'aliyah'."_

_My mother thought about it and put the pieces together._

_"A liar," She whispered to herself._

_"Whatever that is, it didn't sound good. I don't want to be it."_  

_"Oh, Charles..." She whimpered, touching her paw against my cheek, rubbing it caringly. "You won't. I promise you, you will never be like that. You're a sweet, kind, and caring person. And when you do find someone, you'd never yell or lie or hurt them... You'd love them fully. I know you will. And they'll love you back, just the same."_

_"I wanna be like you, mommy," I whined, feeling my eyes well up with tears. "You'd never leave me, right? Alone with daddy?"_

_"Of course not, honey." She looked at me in such a way that it seemed she really did believe what she was saying. "Of course not."_

_I smiled and closed my eyes, returning to my sleepy state of mind. "Can you do the thing again?" I asked with a yawn._

_"Of course."_

_She pulled up my t-shirt and exposed my stomach, touching the tip of her finger to my abdomen. She began to trace circles around my belly button, the feeling sending a ticklish sensation throughout my whole body. I giggled just a little as my mother did the same._

_The more circles she traced, the more tired I grew. It was ticklish at first, but then it became like a soothing massage. It was enough to put me asleep._

_And it did._

_The last thing I heard before setting my mind at rest was my mother._

_"I love you, Charlie."_

\~~~

I woke up to a throbbing sense of pain coming from my head. I gasped and caught my breath, sweat dripping down my forehead. My body felt sore and disfigured, as I had slept in a confining, uncomfortable position all night. It was freezing. My teeth were chattering and my limbs were trembling. I sat up, looking at my surroundings.

I had spent the night in the back of my car, sprawled out in the tight, claustrophobic area. The leather seats were not as comfortable as I wanted them to be, and for the first time in my life, I despised owning a Mini Cooper.

I was still in San Francisco. My car was in the parking lot of a local, rundown bar in the middle of, what looked like, a ghost town. I didn't have the strength to drive all the way back to Los Angeles. Last night, after failing to find my mother, I had conked out the moment I had found someplace to park. I was so tired and exhausted, I didn't even think about the consequences of the morning after.

I grabbed the handle on the back of the driver's seat and folded it in so that I could get out of the Mini Cooper. I opened the car door and stumbled out, my leg and arm muscles aching with pain. I used the roof of the car to stabilize myself as I planted my feet onto the concrete floor of the parking lot.

The parking lot itself was wide and covered a lot of ground, but it had no other cars to fill up those empty spaces. It was as desolate as the town I had found myself in. I was the only car in sight.

It was cloudy and the whole environment radiated a gray tint. I knew that it was early in the morning, but it really did feel like a ghost town. Litter and dried leaves blew in the wind like tiny tornados. I inhaled, detecting the scent of cigarette smoke and wet grass.

I looked over at the bar. It was a small, one-story, rectangular box-like building that reminded me of a business complex or a storage facility. There were two doors at the front in the middle of the building, surrounded by glass window panes.

There were no cars, but I saw that there was a motorcycle lying dormant outside. That was when I noticed a man, most likely an employee, walk around the side of the building. He was probably taking out the trash or something. He walked up to the entrance of the bar and unlocked the front doors with his keys. He entered inside and flicked on a little sign, one that said, "Open".

I sighed and closed my eyes.

_Fuck me..._

I shut the door to my car, locking it with my car keys.

I shoved my paws into my pockets and headed over to the bar. My body tensed up from the chill as I made my way towards the entrance.

I entered the bar and shivered, hoping to seek warmth in the interior of the establishment. I pressed the door behind me shut to keep the cold out, rubbing my arms to provide a sense of heat. I turned around and took in the sight of the place.

On the inside, it seemed larger and smaller at the same time. The walls, the ceiling, and the floor had dark wooden-based architecture, along with the furniture. There were many circular dining tables sprawled out amongst the common space with chairs. I watched as the man from earlier arranged all the seats, dragging them to fit with the tables. There was a large projector screen to the left of the bar, probably to play television for the customers. The walls were decorated with framed photographs and images, likely fake guns, a talking fish gimmick, a dartboard, and more. One of the walls was painted with a mural, a landscape piece of a rural countryside mountain range. The painting reminded me of Skyler and his art.

A lot of work was put into this bar for such a seemingly small crew. The singular male employee was spraying the tables with cleaning spray and wiping them down with a washcloth. Once he was done with one table, he turned around and set his sights on me. I froze, not knowing what to do or say. He looked at me for a few seconds and nodded his head. He moved his arm and gestured me to come over to the right side of the room.

I looked to the right to see the famous bar stand. Behind the counter and row of bar stools was the bartender's station. Along the wall ran unlimited bottles of various liquids and alcohol, decked out on shelves. The man hopped behind the counter and removed the jean jacket he was wearing and put on his apron. I guess he was the bartender.

I walked up to the counter and clumsily sat myself down in a seat. I planted my paws on the surface of the tabletop to sturdy myself on the stool. The bartender tossed the washcloth around his shoulder and leaned against the counter, resting his palms against the edges, looking down on me.

He was a feline like Skyler, but taller and more together. He had white hair and gray fur, matching the gray t-shirt he wore underneath the apron. He was skinny, but not like a stick, and adorned glasses on his head. What struck me the most was his eyes.

They were pink, the same color as Skyler's.

"What's got you looking so gray this early in the morning?" The bartender asked me.

I didn't feel like answering. I didn't know what I could say to justify what was even happening to me.

_I mean, how do you tell someone that your life has basically turned into a drama mystery film with the biggest, cheesiest plot twist of all time?_

My silence was enough for the feline to make assumptions. "Gotcha," He concluded.

The bartender nodded and turned around, facing the wall of drinks. He grabbed a large beer glass from the tabletop next to the sink and approached a beer tower with six different faucets at the end of the counter. He tilted the glass and held it up to the nozzle, holding down on the small lever. I watched as he filled the glass with an orange-tinted liquid, foam rising as he slowly tilted it vertically as the liquid reached the rim.

He turned back around and set the full pint down on the counter in front of me. "I could've given you a bottle or something but I figured you'd want something easier to handle."

I clasped my paw around the pint and lifted it from the counter.

_I remember, when I was younger, I would wake up on so many nights to find my father passed out on the couch in the living room, empty bottles of beer sprawled out on the floor like a mindless toddler leaves their toys around the house. I watched him as he slept, promising myself that I'd never become an alcoholic._

_I would promise myself that I'd never become my father._

The glass of beer felt heavy in my palm. The rim of the glass was inches away from my lips.

_It's only one glass..._

I felt my paw pull it in closer without command. I wasn't in control.

_Am I really doing this?_

_Am I really giving up? Submerging into the image of my father?_

_I..._

  

_No. I'm not my father._

_I would never yell at Skyler._

_I mean, I've yelled at him once a very long time ago, but I won't yell at him again. I won't. I wouldn't do that._

_I'm not lying to him. I'm protecting him. Protecting him from danger._

_And I would absolutely never hurt him. Not physically._

_I would never lay a hand on Skyler. That I do know._

_I would never hurt him, beat him, slap him, or push him like my father did my mother. I would never. Never in my life._

_So, fuck that. It's only one glass. It couldn't hurt._

In an instant, I opened my mouth and brought the rim of the glass to my muzzle. I began to gulp down the alcohol, swallowing repeatedly with no end in sight. I just kept chugging the beer, the foam staining my snout and the liquid washing down my throat.

I hated the taste but it felt good. It was like sucking on a penny, yet I couldn't stop myself.

_From a distance, did I look like Hugo?_

_No, fuck that, Charlie. Fuck that._

The drink was gone in mere seconds.

I slammed the empty glass back down on the counter and wiped my snout of foam. I gasped and caught my breath. I have never, in my life, been so thirsty for something I didn't want to drink. But it felt like a necessity now.

"Another, please," I coughed, rubbing my forehead with my paw.

"Hey, man, are you alright?" The bartender asked, showing concern in his voice.

"Just refill the glass, please," I begged, scratching my head with fury.

"If you say so," The bartender spoke, grabbing the glass and refilling it.

My hands were fidgeting. I felt myself begin to drool as I watched the cat pour the beer back into the glass. I had an incessant need for it.

Once he handed it back to me, I snatched it and downed it once again. The glass was empty in only twelve seconds. The cat stood back and watched me drink with worry in his eyes.

"Hey, slow down!"

I collapsed my arm back down on the counter with the empty glass in my paw. "One more, please?"

"Dude, you should take a break." The cat crossed his arms.

"Please, I need it!"

"You just drank twenty-four ounces of beer in less than a minute‚Äî"

"Please!"

The cat went quiet and sighed, obviously conflicted. He grabbed the glass and went back to the faucet, shaking his head as he filled it up. As he handed it back over to me, I heard the sound of the front doors open.

"Take your time with this one, I need to tend to other customers," He warned, firmly placing it down on the counter. He walked back around the bar stand and headed to serve the people who had entered the bar.

I looked at the glass, another bead of sweat rolling down my face. I watched the bubbles in the liquid fizz and swim around, calling my name.

I took one sip, heeding the cat's advice. I parted my lips from the rim and swallowed, taking my time. I took another sip, a larger one this time. I parted my lips from the rim and swallowed. I took another, even larger now. I didn't part my lips this time. I gulped down one mouthful, then another.

Before I knew it, I was chugging the glass again.

And it was empty.

I turned around on the stool and saw the cat finding a table for the two customers to sit at. I raised my paw, hoping to get the bartender's attention. He saw me out of the corner of his eyes, but he ignored me.

That got me a little angry.

I watched as he took the couple's order, scribbling down on a notepad. He smiled at them. They smiled back. The three of them laughed.

"...Hey..." I called in a low, slurred voice.

The cat definitely heard me. So did the couple. They looked back at me as the cat continued to take their order, not giving me the attention I requested.

"...Hey!" I called again, a little louder now.

The cat glared at me with a stern expression. It must've been a warning. One I did not heed.

He went back to taking their order.¬†

For some reason, I was not in my right mind today.

"HEY!" I yelled, causing the cat to immediately stand upright. The couple looked at me, a little disturbed.

"One moment," he told them with a smile.

He then faced me and marched fiercely over to where I was with provocative anger. He approached me and snatched the glass away from my hand and stared me down.

"If you don't shut up and behave properly, I will fucking throw you out, you got that?!" He hissed in a low voice, intimidating me to the core.

I went quiet as he glared at me, setting the empty glass down and making his way back to the couple with a sigh.

He apologized to them and took their order. I waited as he scribbled down notes. I waited as the couple requested to watch the news. I waited as he pulled up a stool and stood on top of it, reaching for the projector that was hooked to the ceiling. I waited as he did his job, impatient for a refill. My leg kept bouncing up and down. My limbs kept shaking. He turned on the projector and allowed the couple to watch the news as they waited for their order.

He walked back over to where I was and hopped behind the counter. I sat there, waiting for him to address me. He grabbed two mugs and prepared the coffee machine on the counter. He glanced at me as he fit the pouch of coffee grinds into the machine.

"What's up with you?" He asked as he got to work.

"I've just had a long day, now could you‚Äî"

"It's the morning. Your day hasn't even started yet. Hopping into my bar and drinking yourself to death is the first thing you did this morning, don't lie. I saw that you slept in the parking lot in your car. You looked terrible. You still do. You're a mess and your shivering. Now, what's up with you?" The cat talked me down.

I sighed and rested my head in my paws.

"It's family-related," I muttered, not wanting to talk to him.  

The coffee machine began to whirr. The bartender held onto the machine as it got to work, yet he kept looking at me. "What happened?"

"You're a stranger, why should I tell you?"

"Well, I'm being paid to serve drunkards like you, so you might as well make it more interesting for me."

"I'm not a drunkard!"

"I've been working here for years, I know what you are. Now, what's going on with your family?"

"I... I..." _I wanted to argue, but... I knew there was no point in that._ _There was nothing better to do. I haven't really gotten the chance to rant about my situation to anyone yet. So, why not now? I mean, it won't matter in the long run, there's no way this single bartender will have an effect on my entire circumstance._ "My father lied about my mother's death when I was young. Only recently did I find out that she's been alive all this time."

"Jesus Christ," The bartender murmured to himself below his breath. He shook his head and stared back at the coffee machine.

"And I've been focusing so much on finding her that I haven't made any time for my boyfriend."

"You have a boyfriend?" The cat asked in a gentler tone, a little surprised. I nodded slowly. I could hear the liquid pouring into the coffee pot the bartender was holding underneath the faucet. "Is he supporting you in this?"

"He doesn't know."

The cat's pink eyes widened. "Why the hell not?"

"It's... complicated." I shook my head and grunted, rubbing my forehead with angst.

Once the pot was filled, he grabbed the two mugs and poured the hot coffee into each of them. I heard the front door open once again, likely another customer. The cat glanced up at the entrance with his eyes as he filled the mugs.

"Is that him?" He asked, setting the pot back down and picking up the steaming mugs by the handles.

"Who?" I asked, confused.

"The anxious feline, standing at the entrance, staring you down worriedly?" He described, leaving the counter to give the couple their drinks.

The moment I heard that description, I immediately sat up and spun around frantically, in fear that I had been caught by Skyler.

Once I saw who the bartender was pointing out, I knew that I _had_ been caught.

But not by Skyler.  
  
  

"Charlie," Jonathan gasped from across the bar, running over to where I sat.

I couldn't even believe he was here. I blinked, wondering if it was a hallucination, but no. The closer the lion got to me, the clearer his presence became. His face was full of much more concern than the cat's. He looked at the empty glass of beer sitting on the counter next to me, disturbed. He was terrified for me as a friend to see me in this position.

"Jonathan, what‚Äî" I sputtered with complete shock. _How the hell was he here?_

"What are you doing here?" He hurriedly questioned me, taking a seat on the barstool to the left of me.

"Jonathan, I..." I was at a loss for words. "What are _you_ doing here?"

"Your _dad_ texted me," He told me, putting the emphasis on the 'dad'. I felt my body sink with doom. "Your _dad_ told me you'd be here."

"My _father_ did?" I leaned in, utterly appalled.

"Yeah, how does he have my number?"

"I... I mean... He always took my phone from me in high school and read my texts, maybe that‚Äî"

"Yeah, yeah, he texted me and told me that you were in San Fransisco and that you needed help. Why are you here?"

"How did you find me here?"

"I took a bus, used Find My Friends, tracked your phone‚ÄîAnswer the fucking question, why are you here, Charlie?"

"Jonathan..."

"And your father also didn't want me to notify Skyler because, apparently, he's to be 'kept out of this'." Jonathan stared me down as if he was interrogating me for a crime. I sat there, hiding my face like a coward. "What's going on, Charlie? What is 'this'?"

"I... I..."

I took a deep breath.

_There's no way out of this._

_I just have to tell him._

\~~~

About half an hour later, Jonathan and I were still sitting at the counter of the bar stand. More people began to fill up the bar, but no one decided to take any of the seats next to us. I looked at the empty glass, staring at the tiny remaining droplets of beer at the bottom. Jonathan had gotten his own pint of beer, but he was only halfway finished with it. And it was his first glass.

"Safe to say, I couldn't find her." I finished my story. Jonathan sighed and sat back on the stool, taking it all in, everything that I had told him. He let it process in his mind before he gave any feedback.

"Jesus, man..." Jonathan exhaled, shaking his head and leaning against the counter. "I'm so sorry."

I kept staring at my glass, unable to say anything in response. I had said too much.

"Why didn't you tell Skyler?" Jonathan asked once again.

"Because, I told you, I'm protecting him," I whispered as if Skyler could somehow be listening in. "This is something I had to figure out myself, I can't have him trying to get involved. I know he cares, but that would just be too much for me. I can't have him worrying about me when he's already starting to get a hang of his own life."

"What's the worst that could happen, Charlie? Really?"

"If I told him, it would end with me pushing him away and eventually hurting him. Not physically, but... the last time I let him help me, I spun out of control and I insulted him. I told him he wasn't a part of my family. That broke him. I can't do that again. Even if I tried, I can't stop it from happening. It's an instinct. If I allow him to help, that means he has to take me at my true worst."

"Isn't that the point of a relationship?"

"Not if I'm the one hurting him."

"Charlie, the way I see it, you have two choices. Tell him or don't. Either choice ends with you hurting Skyler, Charlie. One is more justified. Telling him the truth."

"No. One keeps him safe from danger for longer. The other just submits him to it. I have to keep him safe for as long as possible."

"Charlie, what danger are you talking about? You're always saying that you're 'protecting' him from something. What exactly are you protecting him from? You say that if he knew, he would be in danger, what does that mean?"

"I'm the danger! My family is! I don't want to hurt him, I've said that over and over again! I don't want to hurt him!"

"You lie to Skyler, you're already hurting him." Jonathan pointed at me.

"It's the only thing I can do."

"You can tell him the truth."

"And if I do, I hurt him. I just want to protect him."

"Charlie, you've spent your entire life protecting others. Don't you think it's time they protect you?"

"No. That's not my job."

Jonathan looked at me like I was insane.

"What do you mean, 'that's not your job'?!" He protested, leaning in closer. "Being the one protected isn't your job? Neither is being everyone's bodyguard! Charlie, you have a serious issue with conveying your own emotions. All you do is suppress them into yourself. You never let anyone help you, you just think you can deal with it all yourself. You think you can fix everything yourself." I looked away with a scoff, trying to get him to stop. I didn't need to hear this. "Remember Skyler when you first met him? He was a mess. He didn't let anyone see the inside of him and he didn't open up to anyone."

"That's because he was broken himself! He needed help! I don't need help, I'm fine! I just need to find my mom, that's it, it's not a big personal internal issue. Skyler was raped and assaulted."

"She's your mother, Charlie. That's a big personal internal issue."

"It doesn't matter. I can handle it myself. I don't know why you came here to help me, I'm fine." I instantly sat up from the counter and headed for the exit. Jonathan sat up and followed close behind.

"Charlie, wait‚Äî"

"Hey! You have to pay!" I heard an angry voice shout that wasn't Jonathan's.

I turned around and saw the bartender running over to me in order to stop me from leaving. The cat halted right in front of me and crossed his arms, holding one of his paws out for his money. Jonathan and the other customers in the bar watched the exchange.

"Fuck," I grunted, reaching into my back pocket and pulling out my wallet.  

I sighed and searched through the crumpled dollar bills, finding the correct payment. I looked up at the cat and saw the anger seething through his face. He had already had enough of me. I had caused him so much trouble today. He just wanted me to pay and leave.

_I really was a dick to him this morning..._

_He had gone through a lot today as well, having to man this entire bar by himself..._

I pulled out an extra twenty-dollar bill as a tip. I put my wallet back into my pocket.

"What's your name?" I asked quietly.

"K... Kol..." The cat responded, caught off guard by my question.

"I'm sorry, Kol..." I whispered in a defeated, powerless voice. At a loss, I dropped the money into his palm. He looked at it in his hand, the anger leaving his face.

I bit my lip, trying to contain my emotions. Usually, I never had the ability to cry. I didn't know whether it was because of the alcohol or the fact that I was in _this_ current situation, but my eyes began to well up with tears.

I looked at everyone in the bar, noticing that I really had made a scene today. I closed my eyes and sighed, turned around, and headed for the exit before anyone could see me cry. I opened the doors and left the bar, leaving everyone inside with a short story to tell their friends, family, or coworkers once they got to wherever they were heading next.

I could hear Jonathan chase after me in pursuit, exiting the bar along with me.

"Charlie, wait!" He called, wanting me to stop.

I kept walking to my car with hands-in-pockets, ignoring him. It was still cloudy outside as it was this morning. The parking lot had a few more cars, but I could definitely see where I was going, even if my eyes were a bit clouded with tears.

"Charlie, you're not driving home while drunk, I won't allow that."

"Just leave me alone," I mumbled, not wanting him to hear.

"Charlie!" Jonathan grabbed me by the shoulder and forcefully spun me around.

He looked at my face, noticing all the tears that stained the fur on my cheeks. My eyes must've been red. Jonathan's expression became even more worried and emotional. "Charlie..."

"Don't! Don't say anything," I whimpered, unable to look him in the eyes. I wiped my tears away frantically. I hated being seen like this. "You're right, I'm drunk. I'm not crying. I just need to get home."

"Charlie." Jonathan placed his paws on my shoulders.

"I'm not sad! I don't need help! I can do this myself!" I jerked away from his touch, taking a few steps away from him.

"Charlie, stop this!" Jonathan exclaimed, grabbing me by the face. His paws touched my cheeks and dried my tears. The lion's eyes were also starting to water. He was horrified for me. "Stop!"

"Just let me go home, I can fix this," I cried, tears rushing down my face like a waterfall.

"Charlie..." Jonathan consoled, pulling me into a hug.

He wrapped his arms around me tightly. I tried to fight it, but he wouldn't let me go. He just kept hugging me. I couldn't hold him back.

"Stop... stop..." I couldn't even vocalize my words anymore. They were just passing breaths morphed by my tongue and my teeth into a soft incoherent language.

I couldn't stand fighting him anymore. I rested my head on his shoulder, not knowing what else to do.

I just cried. There was no other choice.

I was unrestrained, unbound.

I just cried into his shoulder.

"You need to stop this, Charlie," Jonathan told me one last time.  
  
  

_It hurt the most because even though he was trying so hard to convince me, I knew I could never stop myself. I knew I could never do it._

_Because I was Charlie Cooperton._

_And Charlie Cooperton was hopeless._

# 26. GET IN LOSER, WE'RE GOING SHOPPING

\~~~

## Skyler

It always feels weird, waking up in a bed that isn't yours. Even if it was, per se, more luxurious and cozy than your own, it just doesn't feel right. You're not adjusted to it.

I awoke in Claire's guest bedroom, nestled underneath the soft blankets of the bed. I rubbed my face up against the blanket that I was hugging tightly, the soft touch reminding me of a certain someone. That reminder got me through the night. I sniffed it, but it didn't smell like him.

I opened my eyes, noticing how bright the room was when there was actual light in the sky. It was a plain, empty guest room that housed only a bed and a desk of clothing drawers. I blinked to adjust my eyes to the brightness and looked to my left, hoping to lay my eyes on one of my best friends in the whole wide world, but Becca was nowhere to be found.

I sat up and scoured the entire mattress for the wolf, but she wasn't here where I left her last night. I rubbed my eyes and yawned, stretching my limbs. I turned my attention to the door to the right and scampered to get out of bed.

I hopped onto the carpet and quietly opened the door, tiptoeing out into the hallway. The tiled floor was freezing on my barefoot feet, and so was I, as I entered the living room, where I was supposed to stay the night.

The house was dead silent. The only sound I could hear was the wind brushing up against the house as the aftermath of the storm last night. I saw my phone lying face down on the coffee table next to the couch. I hurried on over to it and picked it up, hoping for a text, a missed call notification, literally anything, from Charlie.

Sadly, I had no notifications. I felt the hope built up in me diminish.

"Hey, how was your sleep?" I heard a voice come from behind me.

I turned around instantly to see Jonathan, entering the room from the hallway and heading into the kitchen in a hurry. He was already dressed in his clothes, pulling a few bucks from his wallet as he simultaneously attempted to put on his jacket. It looked like he was in a rush to get to work or something. He seemed a little anxious.

"It was nice," I said plainly, standing there with my paws around my phone, holding it to my chest.

"Good to hear, I didn't think that couch would be any good, but you proved me wrong," Jonathan told me, grabbing a plain, cold bagel from the fridge and shoving it into his mouth. He picked up his phone and checked it before putting it back into his pocket.

"Thank you for letting me stay the night," I spoke up.

"Oh, it's no hassle, Sky. Really," Jonathan said through muffled mouthfuls. He devoured that bagel like the apex predator he is.

That was when I heard even more footsteps. Claire also entered the living room, but instead of being dressed to go out like Jonathan was, she was wearing a robe and looked like she just got out of bed. She swiftly walked up to Jonathan as he was leaning over, lacing his shoes tightly.

"Hey, what's going on?" Claire whispered to him, leaning down to his level. I took a step back and turned around, respecting that this is probably a private conversation that I shouldn't intrude on.

"I just have to check in on a friend, I'll be back this afternoon, I hope," I overhead Jonathan say to Claire.

"Can you tell me what it is?" Claire pressed.

"I'll text you, alright? I have to go now," He dismissed, the sound of a small kiss coming from behind me. It then got quiet.

_He probably just kissed her forehead and went to leave._ I turned back around to see the two of them _still_ kissing. Jonathan backed up into the hallway that led to the front door in the middle of the kiss as Claire kept holding on to him, drawing the small peck out into a long make-out session. I stood there, awkwardly watching them love up on each other.

"Claire‚Äî" Jonathan chuckled, his voice muffled from the contact of their muzzles.

"Wait, mm‚Äî" Claire kept getting closer to him. Jonathan tugged her in at the waist and felt up her body.

"O-oh..." I immediately looked at the floor, flustered, and awkwardly covered my eyes with my left paw, reaching for the couch blindly with my right hand. I found the edge of the couch and maneuvered around it, sitting on the cushions, facing away from them. I stared blankly at the window to the backyard as the sounds of them swapping spit echoed throughout the house.

"Alright, alright‚Äî" Jonathan gasped, likely pulling away from her. "‚ÄîI gotta go, babe."

"Good luck," she wished amorously.

I heard the sound of the door open and close. I sat there, waiting in the silence for Claire to address me so that I had a reason to do anything. Right now, I was stone-solid awkward.

Suddenly, Claire walked up to me and sat down on the couch beside me.

"Sorry you had to see that," she giggled, scooting towards me and leaning her head on my shoulder.

"You guys seem perfectly fine to me, I don't know what you're worried about," I told her.

"Really? You don't think the way he left just now was a bit random?" Claire wondered, a little suspicious.

"He said he had to see a friend."

"I dunno, sometimes I feel like he's lying just to get away from me."

"You guys basically just had sex in front of me, I don't think he's going anywhere."

"God, you're so pure and innocent," Claire swooned, reaching up and caressing my face. "If you think _that's_ sex, you don't wanna know what happens in the bedroom."

"Ugh, don't put that image in my mind," I whined, covering my face with my paws and going red.

"Hey," Claire spoke, sitting up straight and touching two fingers to my shoulder, moving each finger forward, alternating one after another to resemble two legs walking up my arm. "When you, eventually, do it with Charlie... you'll find out that it's not so scary as you think. When you have sex with someone you love for the purpose of nothing other than loving them, you'll see that it's really just a moment of intimacy and togetherness. It's not as sexual as you think. It's, just, love. On a deep, physical level."

I felt my face heat up the more she talked about it. I nodded my head, not knowing what else to do to show that I was listening. Whenever I go quiet and do nothing, people always worry about me, so I try my best to show visual adherence. But, Claire could still tell I was embarrassed, somehow. She could always read me.

"You ready to go to the mall today?" She changed the subject.

I took a deep breath and nodded once more. "I hope so."

Claire sat up from the couch and stretched her limbs, readying her body for the day. "I'll make us breakfast‚Äîsince I'm such a great chef‚Äîand then I'll wake up Becca and we can go."

"Oh, wait‚Äî"

That was when we heard a loud, blaring car horn coming from outside of the house. It came from the front and echoed all the way throughout the living room. It could've almost echoed throughout the entire neighborhood. It honked three times, too short and too random to be an alarm. And too early in the morning for it just to be passing traffic.

Claire and I both turned around, looking at the hallway towards the front door.  
  
  

We exited the house and opened the malfunctioning gate to find Becca's van parked in the street ahead of us. In the driver's seat was Becca herself, already dressed and glimmering in the morning sun. She kept honking the horn, laughing at us as we walked out onto the sidewalk with faces of confusion.

"Hey, bitches!" She yelled, continuing to honk the horn. She was wearing sunglasses and appeared happy and carefree.

"STOP HONKING!" A neighbor from across the street yelled. Becca turned her head and violently stuck up her middle finger at them.  

"Becca, what's going on?" Claire asked, a little concerned. _The last time they had talked was after Becca kissed her and they fought while drunk. She had slept in the guest room the whole day yesterday._

Now, here she was, dressed to impress and adorning a happy attitude as if it never happened.

"We're going to the mall, aren't we?" Becca shouted from the car.

"How did you know we were‚Äî" I tried to speak.

"I overheard you guys chatting last night. Claire, you're scarily loud."

"Becca," Claire spoke with a more sincere tone, approaching the van window on the sidewalk. "Are you sure you're okay?"

"Oh, hush, you," She joked, booping the tip of Claire's nose. Claire flinched as if she was offended by the action. Becca grabbed the temple of her sunglasses and tilted them down a little, revealing her eyes to Claire. "I heard Skyler was going through a bit of trouble. So, as his friends, I feel it's our duty to help. So, let's put aside our drama for one day and focus on Skyler. He needs this. Now, hop in."

"We haven't even changed yet," Claire sighed.

"Then go on! We haven't got time!" Becca announced, holding her arm out to tell us to get moving.

"I was going to make breakfast, too."

"Give it a rest, will ya?" Becca spoke in a more sympathetic tone, resting her arms on the ledge of the open window. "You've been working and cooking nonstop, you need a break. We'll get breakfast at the shops."

"Are you sure you're okay, Becca?"

"Ask me that one more time and I won't be," Becca snickered, resting her sunglasses back in front her eyes.

I stood back, watching all of it unfold. I didn't know if they were being friendly or pissy with each other. It was hard to decipher the tension happening between the two.

"C'mon, then! Chop chop!" She rushed us, clapping her paws together.

\~~~

I didn't have anything to change into. Claire suggested that I wear something from Jonathan's wardrobe, but again, his clothes were too big for me. I think I was the smallest person in the entire friend group. I ended up taking a shower and wearing the same clothes as I wore yesterday, hoping to change into some new clothes when we got to the mall.

The drive over was strangely awkward. The three of us sat in the front as I was small enough to fit between Claire and Becca. Claire kept staring out of the window as we drove past buildings and homes, obviously conflicted. Becca seemed to be overly happy, which was putting both Claire and me off. She was humming the entire time we drove over to the mall.

We parked in the same spot in the garage as we did last time we were here. The three of us made our way over to the mall and passed through the busy crowd. Becca grabbed both of our hands and helped us navigate through the sea of animals, laughing in the process. I began to laugh a little as well, while on the other hand, Claire was still undecided whether to be having fun or not.

We reached the front of the store that we had stopped by last time. The window still held the mannequin wearing the same dress Claire had bought on display. I looked at all the other dresses in the window, swallowing my pride.

_Was I really going to find the answer to all of my problems here?_

"You ready, Sky?" Becca asked, grabbing ahold of my left paw.

"Remember, if you ever feel uncomfortable, just tell us, okay?" Claire continued, grabbing my right paw.

"It's just shopping," I inhaled. "What could go wrong?" I exhaled.

"It's just a little bit of shopping," Becca said.

"Just a little bit of shopping," Claire repeated.

I inhaled and exhaled once more.

"Let's go."

The three of us entered the shop.  
  
  

The interior of the womens clothing store was a long, narrow shopping space with wide racks of female clothing of all sorts, attached to hangars lining the metal beams and hooks coming off of the walls. Almost every surface in the building was glowing white, putting more attention on the colorful articles of clothing. Small white rectangular bases in the middle of the store were the foundations of mannequins, which adorned different outfits to make them look more appealing. The entire place was occupied by women of many species, searching for the right look for different purposes. Whether it was to fashion up their appearance for a date or to attract wandering eyes, or to impress and intimidate for a new job or high position, or to match their friends' outfits for a fun night out or a friendly get-together. You never know the reasoning behind a person's choice of clothing, but I guess that's just the romance of certain old clothes.

There were some men in the store, but not a lot. They were only the boyfriends or husbands of more passing women or the toddler sons of mothers who can't afford a babysitter and have to take their kids anywhere they go.

Already, I felt pressured.

Becca and Claire, like the shopping freaks they are, immediately walked up to separate racks of clothing beside me, admiring the decor.

"Oh my god, I love this dress," Claire gushed, staring at a velvet, rosy-red attire.

"Remember, we're here for Sky, not ourselves," Becca reminded, approaching Claire beside the dress and leaning her arm against the rack.

"Obviously," Claire rolled her eyes, snatching the hangar that the dress was attached to and holding the shoulders up to mine. "It would look good on them, wouldn't it?"

I looked down at the dress in front of me, unable to say a word. My mouth was shut.

"It's hard to find the right color dress when your fur is so... vibrant," Becca noted.

"It doesn't have to be just dresses, what else would Sky look good in?" Claire turned to Becca.

"I like dresses," I spoke up, quietly. Claire and Becca looked at me, organizing their thoughts.

"What do you like about them?" Becca questioned.

"Well," I looked around, wondering if anyone was staring at me. _I mean, it must've been strange to see a male cat like me in a woman's clothing store, right?_ "I like the... shape of them? I don't know, I feel like they... fit my body. The way they, sorta, hang from my shoulders and drape down from my waist... it, just, makes sense? I don't know..."

Claire nodded her head. "Yeah, no, I see it, I understand."

I kept talking. "I've always felt attracted to them, but I was afraid to wear them... because of obvious reasons..."

"You thought people would judge you?" Becca assumed.

"I mean, you don't see a man wearing a dress everywhere he goes," I mumbled.

"Sky, gendered clothing is a social construct. You don't have to live by the standards. Now, what kind of dresses do you like?" She asked, backing up and directing the two of us towards another rack of various garments.

"I guess, I, uh," I was stuttering a lot. I've never shown such a feminine side to my friends before. "I don't know... Um, I like flower patterns..? They're cute and I love flowers and... I don't know, they just seem very sweet..."

"Sweet and wholesome, like you," Becca complimented, making me blush.

"Aw, look, this one has a white lily pattern!" Claire picked out a new gown from the rack. It was a long, black dress with white flowers decorating the sleek cloth, the white stems twisting and turning elegantly. "You know what white lilies represent? Virginity."

I felt my face burn even redder. Claire tossed me the dress and I caught it with a stumble, almost dropping it. I clasped my arms against my chest to hold the dress tightly, grabbing drooping parts of the fabric away from the floor.

"C'mon, Sky, when are you gonna let Charlie 'deflower' you?" Becca teased, slapping me on the shoulder.

"Please, don't be the one to give Skyler sex advice, Becca," Claire told her, scanning the rack and retrieving another dress, a pink garb with tiny white and red flowers, making a continuous pattern all the way down the fabric. "This one's cute too." She tossed it into my arms again.

"What, are you gonna be the one to give Sky, 'the talk'?" Becca bantered back to Claire. "How's your sex life with Jonathan, anyway?"

"Again with this..?" I muttered, quiet enough so they couldn't hear.

"We have a vibrant sex life, thank you very much," Claire smirked.

"Ms. Fifty Shades of Gray, over here," Becca whispered to me.

"Um, you're calling _me_ that?" Claire scoffed, pointing to herself. "Remind me, how many girls have _you_ fucked in your van?"

"W-Wait, what?" I stuttered.

"Alright, Claire, you didn't have to tell Sky _that_."

"And it makes me wonder, how come you haven't started a relationship with any of them? They seem sweet, I met one of them once, remember when I walked over to your van that one night and it was shaking and all the windows were fogged up‚Äî"  

"Claire!" Becca interrupted her, slapping her arm. Claire laughed and went back to scanning the rack as we walked down the store.

"I'm just saying, you've been wanting a real girlfriend, why not call up one of your joyrides?"

"I don't know... It's just..." Becca bit her lip, finding the right words. "It's not real, you know? And I'm not doing it to look for something real, even though that's what I want in the end. All of those girls I've seen, they just... They don't work for me. They get too attached, in a weird way, not in a good way. I want a real relationship, not a hookup or a one-night stand that mean nothing. One of those relationships that start with friends and end with... whatever."

I watched the two talk in their own bubble as if I wasn't a part of this conversation. Both me and Claire glanced at each other, knowing that Becca was referring to the fox standing right beside her. We didn't know if Becca said what she was saying on purpose or if it was subconsciously coming out.

It got quiet when Becca was done with her rant. I was busy trying to organize all the dresses in my arms, hanging them over my left arm. Claire didn't know what to say. She just kept scanning the clothing hangars.

"Oh, I love this one," Claire then reached for another piece of clothing from the rack and handed it to me. Becca looked at her, a little saddened, as if what she said didn't matter. "Isn't it pretty?"

I looked down at the clothing in my arms and found myself falling in love with it. It was a cold-shoulder, short-laced dress with a large sunflower print decorating the front, sides, and back of the fabric. "Aww, this is beautiful," I gawked, smiling at it.

"C'mon guys, let's split up and get as many bloody outfits for Sky we can find. We'll make better time," Becca suggested, leaving the two of us for another section across the store. She obviously wanted some space.

"Alright, you keep looking in the dress section, we'll find you something a little different," Claire told me, turning around to head over to another area of the room.

"W-Wait!" I blurted out before Claire could leave. "H-How do I do this..?"

"Go shopping?" Claire filled in the blank.

"How do I know what'll fit me and what won't..?" I asked quietly.

"Just look for things that make you feel something inside, whether it's warmth or attraction, and just act accordingly."

"I'm scared to do this alone," I told her, grabbing her arm.

"Skyler," Claire spoke sincerely, holding my shoulders. "Whether we're here helping you or not, you're always going to be doing this alone. This is a _you_ thing, Sky. It's up to you to help find your way. Why not get a head start and try finding your own clothing?"

"I'm scared, Claire," I whispered, my paws shaking once again. "What if it's true..? What if I really am... transgender?"

"What scares you about that, Sky?"

"Charlie... What if Charlie won't like me that way?"

"Skyler. Charlie has no say in this. Neither do I. Neither does Becca. This is all you."

"I don't want to lose him."

"How could that possibly happen?"

"Becca... she had a girlfriend... she transitioned to a boy and they broke up over it. I don't want that to happen to me and Charlie."

"That was a different circumstance, Sky. This is yours. Charlie loves you. He loves you so, so much. I've never seen someone so in love before, Sky. He'd do anything for you. He's your protector. I doubt that'll affect your relationship at all. But, if you still don't know, how about you do the right thing and talk to him about it?"

"I'm scared to tell him."

"Then tell him anyway." Claire let go of my shoulders. "Find your dresses. Meet us by the fitting room."

I nodded my head as she left me, heading off towards the end of the store. I stood there, watching the distance between us expand slowly, leaving me feeling more on my own.

I turned my attention towards the rack. I brushed my paw against the ripples of fabric as I walked past the articles of clothing, touching every dress until I found something I liked.

\~~~  

My arms were semi-filled, carrying about seven dresses that I had sought out from the large wardrobe. I noticed Claire and Becca by the opening in the wall that lead to a small room with three or four closet-like stalls inside. There were large letters above the entrance that read, "Fitting Rooms". There was a female employee in the room, waiting for the next customer to enter the fitting rooms to offer assistance. The fox and the wolf seemed to have immediately gotten over their awkward tension, now sharing what they found for me with excitement, complementing each other's choices. I slowly approached them, the dresses hanging over my arms as if they were doing backbends. They both noticed me and, immediately, their faces lit up with thrill. They ran over to me, quietly squealing.

"Okay, we found you the cutest little outfits," Claire beamed, showing the amount of clothing lying in her arms.

"It's crazy to me how adorable small-people clothing is," Becca spoke, then pausing and catching herself. "Uh, no offense, but damn, these pieces are to fucking die for. I wish I was thin enough for this," Becca sighed, looking at the pile of apparel in her paws.

"Um... this is a lot of clothes... I don't wanna work myself out trying them all on..." I awkwardly chuckled.

"Don't worry, we have all day! And trust me, it'll be worth it," Claire encouraged.

"I wanted to get home to Charlie before he got back from work," I told her.

"You'll be back in time, we promise," Becca assured me. "Now go, try on something."

I looked at the items in my hand, grabbing the handle of the clothing hangar and holding up the sunflower-patterned dress. "I really like this one."

"Go, try it on!" Claire rushed, patting my back and gently shoving me in the direction of the fitting rooms.

I nervously walked into the little room with the stalls.

The employee who was waiting approached me. She was a cat, just like me. The woman wore a lot of designer clothing, including a leather jacket and ripped skinny jeans, and her white hair was styled in a very fashionable way, pulling over to the right side of her head with frizzy, wavy strands. The only thing that distinguished herself as an employee was the ID she wore around her neck, hanging in front of her chest, reading, "Karol". It was weird, her eyes were pink as well. Just like mine. "Need a stall?" She asked.

"Yes, please," I responded under my breath, quivering a little.

The employee did her best to make me feel comfortable. She led me over to the stall that stood all the way to the left of the room, Claire and Becca following close behind. Karol opened the door for me and allowed me inside. "Thank you," I said, entering the booth. She nodded her head and shut the door for me.

I was now inside a tight, claustrophobic space the size of a bathroom stall with no toilet, nor toilet paper. There was just a small seat, a head-to-toe mirror, and a few hooks nailed into the walls to hang clothing. I looked at myself in the mirror, staring at the reflection with ease.

I looked at my face. My body. What I was wearing at this moment.

"C'mon, Sky," I whispered to myself. "Find your identity."

I grabbed the collar of my shirt and pulled it off of me with a struggle. I then grabbed the button of my jeans and carefully removed my legs from the denim. I saw myself again, shirtless with no pants. I was skinny. My waist was so small and my stomach basically caved inwards. Even though my chest was exposed, I imagined what it would look like if I was wearing a bra. _Would it feel more natural? Or would it feel wrong?_

I looked over at the sunflower dress hanging on the hook. I caringly took it down from the hanger and held it out in front of me.

I put it over my body and slipped into the dress, climbing through the fabric and extruding my arms and head out through the holes. I adjusted the dress into place and looked back at the mirror.

I felt myself light up at the sight.

_The dress was beautiful. It fit me._

_It was what I wanted._

_I felt good in the dress. More comfortable._

I bit my lip and swayed my hips around a little, watching the skirt of the dress twirl gracefully. I softly giggled.

_I loved the way it made me feel. I loved the way it made me look._

_And I looked beautiful._  
  
  

_Wait... Beautiful..?_

I stared at my reflection. I brushed my paw through the fur behind my ears and smiled. I held my arms close to my chest and tilted my knees towards each other.

I liked the way I looked. I liked being girly. I liked being feminine. I've always liked it. But I hid it for so long that I almost convinced myself I hated it.

I didn't have a wig, but I could easily pass for a female. I didn't even need long hair to look like one.

I just was female.

_I..._

_Wait, what did I just say?_

"Sky, come out!" Claire called.

I took a deep breath and grabbed the handle of the stall door, opening it. I stepped out and revealed myself cautiously. I hid my face, not wanting them to see how smitten I was.

Claire and Becca looked me up and down, stunned. Their jaws dropped and their eyes widened. They began to clap and cheer me on, making me blush and laugh. I covered my face with my paws, unable to take the appreciation. Even the employee nodded her head and gave me a thumbs up from behind Claire and Becca, leaning against the wall.

"Damn, Sky!" Claire whooped.

"Sheesh, you might just make me simp over you as well," Becca flirted.

"You're definitely keeping that one," Claire nodded her head.

"For sure," Becca added.

"I love it," I said with a low voice, picking the skirt up with my fingers and twirling around like a girl. "I... I really love it." I felt myself get emotional at the thought.

_Why was I so afraid of this..?_

_I feel... so happy right now..._

"Try the next one on!" Claire told me, eager for the next appearance.

"Okay!" I gushed, disappearing back into the stall.

I changed into the next dress.

I opened the stall door and got another applause.

I felt happier.

I went back in and changed.

Claire and Becca hyped me up once again. Even Karol clapped her hands for me.

I changed into several dresses. Some I loved. Some I didn't really appreciate. Some were maybes.

Claire and Becca were constructively honest about their opinions, which I desired. The employee just kept nodding her head to whatever they said, agreeing with them.

I moved on from the dresses and went to Claire's wardrobe.

She handed over her load of clothing and I handed back the four dresses out of the seven that I loved to death. Those I would definitely be buying. I walked back into the stall and got back to work.

Claire ordered the clothing in the pile as pants, top, pants, top, and so on and so forth. She had gotten me a lot of aesthetic, cutesy clothing that you'd find on Shein or any teen girl's Instagram feed. I started with the 'front-buttoned, long bell-sleeve, shirred, tight hem, plaid top', (that's what the tag said, I literally didn't know how to describe what I was holding) and the long, bell-bottom jeans. I saw my reflection, realizing how stylish it made me look.

This time, I didn't worry about my stomach being exposed, since the top was so short and was basically a crop-top. It felt good at this moment. The risky appearance felt new and exciting. I saw myself and my body in a whole new light. This outfit would go perfect with the silver necklaces I have at home or a small purse.

I exited out of the stall and Claire and Becca cheered once again. Karol crossed her arms and nodded with a grin. I couldn't stop blushing. My serotonin was rising at an unstoppable rate.

I went in, I changed into clothes, I formed my own opinions, I came out, I got opinions. For the most part, the clothes were cute. Some didn't work well, but it ended up being a good learning experience for what fit and what didn't.

In my mind, I loved every second of it.

Moving onto Becca's outfit choices, of course, she had given me more _risqu√©_ articles of clothing.

She had gotten me a mesh tank top with a red fabric lining underneath, made to make my chest stand out a bit more. The denim shorts that paired with them were incredibly short with rips at the end that almost made my butt visible. There were some outfits I wasn't comfortable enough stepping out in, but there were some I felt good in.

I had never thought, _ever_ in my life, that I could try to look sexy. But, some looks made me feel a little daring. I didn't know why. A fresh, exciting, thrilling side of me was being introduced, and who knows how explicit that side could get?

_Maybe Charlie would enjoy... doing it... with me..?_

_Would he like this kind of clothing that I'm wearing..?_

I came out, wearing Becca's last outfit, which was plaid overalls over a tight, white undershirt.

As usual, Claire, Becca, and Karol gave me their positive feedback.

"Wait, I forgot one thing!" Becca interrupted herself, holding her finger up. Claire looked at her, confused. "Let me get it," she said, running back out into the store.

"Let me follow her," Claire sighed with an eye roll, leaving the fitting room in pursuit of the wolf.

I stood there, alone again, awkwardly rocking back and forth on my feet. I looked over at Karol, who was still leaning against the wall. She nodded at me. I nodded back.

"So, what's the story?" Karol asked with a mischievous smile, resting her foot up against the wall as she leaned forward.

"Huh? Me?" I asked after a prolonged silence.

"How'd you end up here, shopping for women's clothes with your friends?"

"Oh, I... I don't know, I... I guess I just... always had this thought in the back of my mind... that I'm not at all who I'm made out to be... Referring to my gender, obviously."

"Don't worry, girl," She chuckled, crossing her arms and leaning back up against the wall. "I know exactly how you feel."

It took a second for those words to settle in my head.

"Wait... are you..?"

"I'm not transgender, if that's what you're thinking. But, I'm definitely not a female. I've never been sure of it, really. All I knew was that I wasn't who I was expected to be and that I felt different. In the wrong body, I guess you could say. I don't use gender-neutral pronouns, I'm not sure if they're necessary, but all I know is I'm not a girl. I'm not who I was born to be. I'm non-conforming. I'm whoever I want to be."

"How did you figure that out?" I queried, holding my paws together with interest.

"I talked to the people I loved most."

"Like your family?"

"My family, my friends, my special other..."

I went quiet and looked at the floor.

Karol could read the gesture as if she had x-ray vision. "I'm guessing you have someone and you're not telling them about this?"  

"How would I even tell them..?" I expressed, closing my eyes and shaking my head. "I don't want things to go wrong between us... I love him, but would he love me the same?"

"I don't know who 'him' is... but it doesn't matter what he thinks. It's you. It's who you are and who you want to be. You can't let the standards of other people take over the standards you hold for yourself. It's your body, your appearance, you. You decide."

Before Karol could continue, Becca and Claire walked back in.

"Becca, Skyler's not gonna want to wear that‚Äî!" I heard Claire pestering as Becca ran up to me, shoving something into my hands.

"Try this!" Becca squealed with an overwhelming amount of excitement in her face.

I looked down at what she had given me, noticing thinly laced fabric with intricate patterns and designs.

"Wait... what is this..?" I started to speak.

"It's lingerie," Claire answered for me, sighing and shaking her head.

"WHAT?!" I gasped, forcefully handing it back over to Becca.

"C'mon, try it on!" Becca whined, trying to put back into my paws.

"I don't need that‚Äî"

"You would look so hot!"

"Becca!"

"Please, don't you want to look sexy as fuck?"

"Becca, no!"

"Charlie would die to fuck you if he saw you in it‚Äî"  

"BECCA!"

\~~~  

Once we were done, Karol led the three of us over to the front counter. We had only picked out a few things for my new wardrobe: a couple of dresses, a few pieces of clothing, and one outfit that could be deemed as suggestive. Claire would keep that one hidden in her closet for me.

Both Claire and Becca offered to pay for everything. I tried to refuse and told them I'd pay with the money I was earning from work, but they would not give it up. They put together their money and bought the clothing. Karol swept the dresses and garments into a wide, rectangular bag that looked too fancy for me to even hold.

"Thank you," I whispered to Karol as Claire and Becca walked ahead with the bag, leaving the store.  

"Don't mention it," she replied, winking back at me.

"I feel like we should talk more," I admitted, tilting my brows.

"I work here 24/7. Come by any time."

I smiled and left, chasing after my sisters.

As I walked down the clean, white-tiled floor of the mall with Claire and Becca, I thought about Charlie and what Karol had told me.

_As much as I would love to tell him... I think I want to wait a little._

_I found out something important today. I need time to understand it for what it is._

I turned my head towards another store near the exit that caught my attention. In the window, there was this mannequin that wore this sleek, black and white striped, souvenir jacket with the word, "Filmmaker", stitched in on the back with shiny white fabric. I had brought money, yet I hadn't put it to good use yet.

_Charlie would love it. I feel like he needs a little something to help with his stress currently, and this would be a cute gift._

I told the others to wait while I entered the store and did a little shopping of my own.  

I bought the jacket in Charlie's size, which was much larger than any of the clothing bought for me. I joined back with the fox and the wolf with my own plastic shopping bag, ready to leave the large shopping center behind.

We left the mall, each of us holding hands.

We entered the parking garage and got back into the van.

We were all in a better mood than how we started off.

Claire and Becca were talking and on better terms.

I was bright and lively, happy to have such good friends.

As we drove back, I felt it was a good time to tell them how I was feeling.

I was a changed person now.  
  
  

"Hey, guys?" I spoke up.

Claire and Becca both went quiet and turned their heads to me, giving me all the attention I needed.

I had the floor, and it was now time for my announcement.  
  
  

"I think... I think it's true."

# 27. YOU FORGOT THIS

\~~~

## Charlie

"Hey, wake up," I heard Jonathan's voice echo in the dreariness of my own mind. "We're home."

I opened my eyes and blinked, adjusting to the scenery. The blur focused and I saw my Mini Cooper parked in the driveway of my and Sky's house. I was lying in the passenger's seat, my head resting against the car window. I shifted my eyes over to see Jonathan, unbuckling his seatbelt in the driver's seat. He noticed that I had woken from slumber, bent out of shape.¬†

"Hey, are you okay?" Jonathan questioned me, touching my shoulder and leaning in to give me a good look.

I felt incredibly dazed from the hangover I was experiencing. A soft ringing played continuously in my ears. I had slept for five hours straight on the car ride home and I could see the sun slowly moving down in the sky. It was the afternoon, but not sunset yet. Sky's bike was nowhere to be seen, likely meaning he hadn't gotten home yet.

I tried to give Jonathan a verbal reply, but my head felt too heavy to say a single word. Jonathan understood the condition I was in and got out of the car. He walked around to the other side of the Mini Cooper and opened the passenger door, reaching in and unbuckling my seatbelt. He wrapped his left arm behind my back and under my arms. The lion then tried his best to heave me out of the vehicle. I grabbed onto his paw and exited the car with a stumble, leaning against his side and gaining my footing on the tar driveway floor.

Jonathan closed the car door with his foot and clasped his arm tightly around me as we hobbled our way towards the house. He took the keys out of my pocket and unlocked the door, luring me through the house and into the bedroom. It all felt like a blur to me, a passing moment in time that I had no subconscious thoughts of.

He lied me down on the bed and stood back, catching his breath. He turned away and leaned over, resting his paws on his knees. He shook his head and rubbed his forehead.

"Jonathan..?" I mumbled, unable to pronounce diction properly.

He stood up and walked back over to the edge of the bed, looking over me from above.

"Am... Am I a bad person..?"

I began to slowly drift back to sleep again, my sight fizzling out as if my eyes were losing signal from my body. I could only see Jonathan's blurred appearance, staring down at me.

"Not if you do the right thing," I heard his indistinct voice say.¬†

My eyes began to water, the blurred image of him becoming even hazier as the tears stained my sight. I closed my eyes, unable to take the pain.

I fell asleep with the dirty, guilty conscience that has haunted me for what felt like a lifetime.¬†

\~~~

**Skyler**

I could hear the sound of the tires squealing and crunching against the road as Becca pulled her van up into the driveway of my home. She then parked the car and turned the key, shutting off the engine. The three of us sat there, in the silence of the sunset, looking out through Claire's passenger door window. The house stood there before the drowning sun below the beach horizon, offering a soft place to land, an end to our journey.

I looked to my left, noticing Becca, the golden rays of the sun making her fur and her eyes glow. Her eyes, in particular, watched the emotional Claire to my right, who was entranced with the sun in the warm, pink-and-blue-gradient sky.¬†

Claire turned around and set her sights on me, an ardent smile on her face. She leaned in and smothered me between her arms, squeezing tight and not letting go.

"I love you, Skyler," she whispered into my ear. "Whoever you choose to be, we will always love you and support you, no matter what."

I felt Becca hug me from behind as well, her arms enclosing around my stomach. I turned around, wrapping my left arm around her while my right arm remained attached to Claire.

"Don't you ever be afraid to come to us," Becca expressed, holding me tightly. "We're your sisters, your family. And family sticks together."

I felt my eyes water at the sentiments being spoken in the safe, guarded sanctuary of our embrace. "I love you guys so, so much," I whimpered, a single tear streaming down my face.

Claire came closer and kissed my forehead. Becca brushed her paw through my fur and touched the tip of her snout to my cheek. They both pulled back and sighed, recovering from the sweet, emotional moment.

"Now, get outta my car before we stain the seats with our tears," Becca sniffled as she wiped her eyes, her voice breaking. Claire and I laughed through our own crying.

Claire opened her door and exited the vehicle for me to get out. Once I had hopped out onto the driveway, Claire got back into the van and closed the door behind her. I walked all the way around to the back of the van and opened the back doors, pulling my bicycle out of the interior. I shut the van doors and grabbed the handlebars of the bike, walking it back up the front of the car. I looked at the fox and the wolf through the car window and bid them a sentimental farewell with a frail wave.

"Hey," Claire whispered to me, leaning out of the window. "Do the right thing. Talk to him when he gets home."

I nodded my head, even though I was still unsure whether I was ready or not to confess this massive thing to him.

"Seeya soon, girl," Claire dismissed, winking at me.

I looked over at Becca behind her, who seemed to be awkward now that I was leaving the two on their own. I turned my attention back to Claire and gave her a warming look, one that said, 'good luck'.

Becca powered on the ignition and grabbed ahold of the steering wheel, pressing on the gas. I watched as the van pulled away, driving into the distance as Claire waved. I gripped the handles of the two shopping bags in my paws, the one containing women's clothing and the other containing Charlie's gift.

I entered the house, and as usual, it was dark, quiet, and empty. I took a deep breath and exhaled, finding peace in the silence of the home.

I slowly flicked on the lights and took my time as I paced towards the bedroom.¬†

I closed the bedroom door behind me as I walked forward, trying to adjust my eyesight to the darkness of the room. I rested the two shopping bags on the carpeted floor and looked up at the mural on the wall to the far right.

_CIVA. College, high school... All those years I spent living with the assumption that I was only a boy, the gender I was assigned at birth. All those years I had been wrongly addressed, by both others and myself. If only I could've known._

I looked back down at the women's clothing store bag and reached inside, retrieving the sunflower-patterned dress.

I held it out in front of me, admiring it. The smile on my face grew wider as the joyful feeling of elation swam around in my heart like a free bird cutting through open winds. It made me want to dance, to sing, to love even further than I've ever loved before.

_This was who I was. And I was finally happy with myself._

_This is the real Skyler Clawfield._  

  

"What's that?" I heard a groggy voice come from behind me.

I didn't even expect to hear a voice in the silence, which caused a massive buildup of horror in my blood.¬†

In an instant, my body surged with fear and adrenaline as the dress slipped out of my fingers, falling back down into the bag. I turned around immediately, noticing that Charlie had been sleeping in the bed the entire time and I hadn't noticed.

"H-Huh?" I stammered, losing my train of thought.¬†

"What's the dress for?" He cleared his throat, sitting up in the bed and rubbing his eyes. He looked incredibly exhausted and close to a mess.

"U-Uh... It‚ÄîIt's for Claire, I was holding onto it for her," I stumbled, holding my jittery paws close to my chest as a defense mechanism.

"Oh, you went shopping?" He asked, dropping his legs over the ledge of the bed frame and landing his feet on the floor.¬†

"A little..."

Charlie sat up from the bed and approached me. All the tension built up in me was finally released as I leaned over with a sigh, letting loose like a ragdoll.

"You scared me!" I whined as Charlie winced, holding his arms out for me. I blushed as the husky closed in, wrapping his arms around my waist.

He slowly leaned in, his muzzle inching closer for contact with my lips. I could feel his breath on my face, drawing me in like an unquenchable thirst. We connected our mouths with a swift movement. I wrapped my arms over his shoulders, holding onto the back of his neck, as he pulled his body into mine. I lifted my right foot up, melting into the kiss, realizing how much I missed the way he felt. We had spent too much time apart.

"How was your day, Mr. Cooperton?" I giggled amorously through the kiss, our lips atoms apart, unable to detach like hardened magnets.

"Don't talk like that, you'll make me horny," Charlie murmured, his paws exploring the fabric of the shirt on my back. It was clear he wanted to take it off, but as always, he restrained himself for me. Charlie grabbed onto my shoulders and held me back, wanting to talk to me, face-to-face. "My day was fine. Yours?"

"It was fine," I responded, placing my paws onto the sides of his face and gently caressing his fur with my thumbs. "How come you're back so early? I thought you didn't get home until nine."

"Short day," He answered, staring longingly into my eyes. By the way his tail was wagging from behind, I could tell he was happy to see me again. He just kept brushing his paw through the fur on my head, rubbing the tiny strands of blue and pink with his claws. "Where were you just now? Shopping?" He asked, referring to the bags on the floor.

"Pretty much." I stepped back and grabbed the plastic bag, holding Charlie's present. "I got you something," I announced, nonchalantly tossing the women's clothing bag into the bathroom, out of sight.

"You did?" Charlie sputtered. He always hated when he got gifts by surprise without having something to give back. I was the same.

I dropped the plastic bag into his hands, grabbing ahold of his shoulders with excitement. "Open it!"

Charlie smiled, sharply exhaling through his nose, and reached into the bag. He retrieved the black and white, striped, shiny, souvenir jacket with the word, 'Filmmaker', stitched in on the back. He held it out by the shoulders and took a good look at it, holding it up in front of him. "Oh, my God, Sky!" He gasped with astonishment. "This is so great! How much did this cost?"

"A little over thirty dollars," I replied, to which he lowered the jacket with a shocked look on his face.

"That much?!" Charlie exclaimed, his jaw-dropping.

"Well, I'm getting paid, I might as well use my hard-earned money," I bragged, crossing my arms.

"Use it for yourself, not me," He sighed, touching my shoulder and massaging it. I rolled my eyes and shook my head. Charlie took one last look at the jacket and pouted. "Thank you, sweetheart," He sniveled, reaching in for another hug.

"God, just try it on, already!" I said, smacking his paws away.

Charlie nodded and reached for the light switch, illuminating the shadow-infested bedroom. He walked into the bathroom and shoved his arms through the sleeves, pulling the jacket over his body. He grabbed the ends of the break line and shook it a little to loosen up all the wrinkles. He stood at an angle, posing in front of the mirror as I stood beside him.

"I look good," He smirked, showing himself off towards the reflection as if he were a runway model.

"You always do," I laughed and walked up behind him, hugging him from the back. "You should wear it to work tomorrow. Show it off to your peers and brag about how you have the best boyfriend in the world."¬†

Charlie didn't respond verbally. He just nodded his head after a short second of hesitation. He smiled, holding onto my arms as I pressed my face against his shoulder blades, taking in the familiar scent of him.

_For some reason, he smelled like alcohol. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so I just assumed he was wearing a new cologne or something._

"Did you want to do that thing we planned? The night where we'd just relax and enjoy our time together?" I asked him, looking up at his reflection from over his shoulder. I took in the sight of us, my arms clasped around his stomach and my head resting in the crevice between his chin and his neck. Charlie held his paws behind him, touching my body, always finding ways to hold on to me.

"Tonight, I'm pretty exhausted," Charlie admitted with a sigh. "But, that doesn't mean we can't relax and enjoy our time together."

"What do you mean?"

"...You wanna just cuddle and... forget about the world?"

"Only if you're the big spoon," I giggled.

"There's no way in hell you'd be the big spoon, so I'm sure you'll be fine."

## Charlie

Skyler and I laid in our bed, in the same positions we usually slept in every night. My paws were snaked tightly around Sky's waist with my right leg just wrapping over his left. Skyler's hands pressed firmly against my chest, his small body fitting perfectly inside my loving embrace. And to top it all off, his lips were connected to mine once more, sharing our deepest, passionate kisses as if we had never kissed before. The blankets covered us all the up to our necks, providing warmth below the sheets.

Skyler had really taken advantage of the moment. He savored every second of the powerful kiss, shoving our bodies into one another as if they were one and the same. Skyler's legs twisted and enclosed my own thigh within the grasp, his upper leg brushing against a certain area of my own body. I released a subtle, deep moan with a small chuckle to thin it out. I sucked in air through my nostrils, unable to breathe through my own muzzle as it was caught in the middle of a tongue battle.¬†

Skyler puckered his lips and parted his mouth from mine, a thin line of saliva extending between Skyler's bottom lip and mine. "Jesus," I exhaled, out of breath. Skyler giggled quietly as the tips of our noses touched, his face scrunching up with laughter. He had never seemed happier.

"What's got you so giggly?" I closed in once again and kissed his cheek, his whiskers getting caught between my teeth. Skyler sniggered even more, the kissing become ticklish against his sensitive fur. I moved further down, dragging my muzzle to his neck, nestling it within the nook between his chin and his shoulder.

I kissed his neck, fully ensnaring the kitten within my long arms, holding him like a hostage. Small, murmured,¬†unintelligible breaths of ecstasy escaped Skyler's mouth as I plunged my lips against his fur, opening my mouth and gently biting the soft layer of his fur and skin.

That was when Skyler expressed a loud, orgasmic moan, his breath growing pleasurably shaky and his body quivering with desire. The two of us froze, eyes widened.

I parted my lips from his neck and looked back up at him. "Woah..." I scoffed as Skyler slapped his paw over his mouth, shocked that a sound like _that_ came out of him.

His face grew red as he pressed his paws to his cheeks, uncontrollably smiling from the embarrassment. "S-Sorry... I..." He breathed, shaking from his own mortification. "I got too into it..."

"That's nothing to apologize about..." I chuckled, gently grabbing ahold of his wrists and pulling his paws down, wanting to see his face. It was still so red and heated, which caused his body to shrivel up, especially near the leg region.¬†

"Wait..." I halted, realizing why he was closing up on himself so much. "Are... are you turned on right now?"

Skyler's eyes widened even more and froze, an awkward silence coming from him that lasted a scarily prolonged period of time. "No..." He denied, his high-pitched voice giving it away.

Instinctively, I reached down towards his crotch, to which Skyler blocked the entry with his own hands. "Quit it!" He squeaked, which got me going. The two of us had our own little play fight as I tried to grab a significant part of his body as Skyler slapped my yearning paws away. "Stop!" He cringed, pushing me away.

"Oh my god, you're so flustered right now," I marveled as Skyler shifted his body, lying stomach-down on the mattress in order to block himself off from any further jabs. He face-planted into the pillow and bewailed a muffled groan, the embarrassment taking over him. "Dude, you literally have a boner, what the fuck," I snickered as Sky began to bang his head against the pillow, back and forth in a repeated, relentless motion.

"Don't say it out loud!" Skyler squealed.

"We live alone!"

"Still!"

"What's going on here? I thought you had issues with arousal," I wondered as¬†I leaned up, resting my cheek on my fist, looking down at the shame-filled feline.¬†

"I dunno..." Skyler turned his head towards me and rested the right side of his face on the pillow. "I guess I... feel more comfortable in my body now..?"

"What caused it?"

"I... I'm just... growing..?"

_Something about that answer felt a little false as if Skyler knew more than he was letting on, but who was I to judge my boyfriend about honesty?_

"You sure are," I smirked, making a subtle-yet-not-subtle dick joke.

"Shut upppp!" Skyler squirmed, hiding his face again with his paws, kicking his feet with angst.

"Hey, hey, Sky," I laughed, brushing my paw through the fur on his head. "You see? You're getting there! You're making progress."

Skyler sighed and showed his face again, which was less red now.

"Can we move on from this topic, please?" He shuddered, turning around and lying on his back.

"Of course," I agreed, tugging him closer to me by his waist. "Come here, baby."

"Don't call me that," Skyler grunted as I pulled him into another cuddle, kissing his forehead.

"Why not? It's cute!"

"It's so weird!"

"Shut up, we've been together for almost four years, I should be allowed to call you 'baby' and 'babe'."

"Call me any one of those pet names and it's staying at four years, no further."

"Ugh, fine," I slurred with a comedic low voice.

Skyler's heartwarming smile returned to his face as he closed in on me once again, giving me an Eskimo kiss as he nuzzled the tip of his snout against mine. He then retreated into my embrace, pressing his head up against my chest as I squeezed him tightly.

"It feels like we don't do stuff like this anymore..." He mumbled into the shirt I wore, locking our embrace in tighter.

"...What do you mean?" I wondered, confused by his words.

"Nevermind..." Sky sighed after a long hesitation. He then yawned and smacked his lips, pressing his snout into my chest and breathing in. "...Can we fall asleep right now?"

"It's eight-thirty."

"So?"

"We haven't had dinner or brushed our teeth or... anything at all."

"I don't care anymore..." Sky quietly moaned with another suppressed yawn. "I just wanna stay here in this bed with you, for as long as possible..."

"Alright, babe."

I heard Skyler groan once more, followed by a small laugh from me.

\~~~

We both woke up early in the morning, lying in the same positions we were in last night.

Another day in the life resumed. I went back to the hopeless process of keeping Skyler in the unknown and searching for a woman that I may never find.

The morning routine went as it always did: I got up, took a shower, got dressed, ate breakfast, and grabbed my things for "work" after a long hour of Skyler convincing me to stay ten more minutes under the covers with him.¬†¬†

As usual, Skyler came to the door and I kissed him goodbye, heading over to my car and entering the vehicle. I looked back, viewing his emotional expression at the door as I parted from him once again. It broke my heart, but there was no other choice for me.

I opened my phone as Skyler closed the front door, leaving me out of sight. I looked at the image I had taken of my investigation board before I had presented it to my father. I thought long and hard on what town I would be visiting next. San Francisco was crossed out on my notes app. I decided to go for a much closer location this time: Santa Monica.

I shoved the keys into the ignition and sighed, looking back up at the house.

A part of me wanted to ditch it all and run back to Skyler and tell him everything, but no matter how badly I wanted that, I wasn't in control of my own actions. It was like I didn't even feel emotion anymore.  

What lied ahead of me was another long and tiring day of searching, ringing doorbells, driving, and getting disappointed.

_C'mon, Charlie._

_You can find her._

_Don't give up._

I pressed my foot to the gas and pulled out of the driveway.

_It's like getting disappointed was an everyday thing now._

\~~~

## Skyler

My phone beeped on the bedside table, cueing me to sit up from bed and reclaim it. I had gotten a notification from my Venmo app that I had received the money transaction for the commission I had finished at Claire's place two days ago. I smiled, glad to be getting my money's worth. I turned off the phone and lied back down on the bed, my head hitting the pillows. I stared up at the crack in the ceiling, a vibe of contentment sliding over me.

_Things are going... well..._

_Things are actually going so well..._

_I feel so happy... and I don't know how to explain it..._

I couldn't wipe the smile off of my face. I held the phone to my chest and took a deep breath, trying hard to contain the joy I was feeling in my heart.

I rewarded myself with another long, hot, satisfying shower. I scrubbed my fur with soap until I was all clean, and once I stepped out of the shower, I felt fresh and pristine, like a blooming flower, both inside and out. I smothered my damp fur in the robe that hung on the hook of the bathroom door and walked back out into the bedroom.

My feet skipped across the carpet, droplets of water hitting the floor, but I didn't care this time. I stepped out onto the bedroom balcony, looking over the beach horizon. I felt the breeze against my soft, wet fur, feeling whole. I had never felt like this before in my life.

_I felt as if I was finally living in my own body, knowing that I was who I was._

_I am Skyler Clawfield, a young, yet, growing girl._

_She is creative. She is artistic. She is beautiful. She may be fragile sometimes, but she's learning how to love herself, in order to love others._¬†

_This is who I am._

_I don't know when I'll be ready to tell the public, but for now, telling myself is the best thing I'm gonna get._

_I am Skyler, and I am transgender._

I tiptoed back inside of the bedroom and twirled around, biting my lip with the blissful ghost of euphoria floating around my body and possessing me whole. I gained my footing, almost losing balance, and stopped.

My eyes landed on the chair in front of the desk that stood in the corner of the room, next to the bed, realizing that something was left hanging on it. The souvenir jacket I had bought Charlie was cloaked over the shoulders of the chair, in the exact same spot Charlie had left it last night.

_He had forgotten to take it._

"Hmph," I snorted, grabbing my phone from the bed and calling Charlie.

After the ringing, I heard, "Hey, what's up?"

I sighed and shook my head. "This is a voicemail, isn't it?"

"Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?" Charlie's prerecorded voice pretended to say.

"You didn't get me this time, bitch," I talked to myself.

"Haha, just kidding, it's a voicemail. I got you again, Skyler, didn't I‚Äî" I hung up the phone.

I dropped my arms to my sides and stared at the jacket, the word, "Filmmaker", shining in the sunlight that was coming through the windows. I shrugged and walked up to it, removing it from the chair and tossing it over my shoulder.

_I guess I'll bring it to him._

_It'll be cute to surprise him at the set as well._¬†

_Maybe I'll even get a sneak peek¬†at what they're filming._

I opened the messages app on my phone and scrolled up, finding the text he had sent me before I had left for Sacramento, listing the address of the set of his film. I tapped on it, copying it to my phone's clipboard.

I changed into my everyday outfit, hiding the bag of women's clothes behind a few pairs of clothing in the walk-in closet.

I grabbed Charlie's jacket and climbed into it, wearing the attire that was double my size. I was so small compared to him that my arms didn't even go protrude through the sleeves.

After turning off all the lights, I stepped outside onto the porch and locked the door behind me.

I walked over to my bike which rested against the porch and hopped onto it. I stared back at my phone, setting directions for the address of the film set on Google Maps. On a bicycle, it was about half an hour away. I was definitely in for a long, grueling ride.

I put my headphones in my ears and resumed my playlist, starting my journey to the set. I grabbed the handlebars with my sleeve-covered paws and biked off down the road, leaving the house behind.

It got a little tiring, cycling my legs and pushing my feet against the pedals, but eventually, I got there. Following the directions my phone gave me, I rode my bike down a suburban street, coming up on what seemed to be another beach house on a hill above the water, yet, this one was more deserted and stand-alone than ours.

I kicked my bike stand out and dismounted my bicycle, walking over to the house, noticing a semi-large group of people. _It was the film crew doing work, I presumed._

_The work in particular struck me as a little odd, though._

The crew was transporting equipment out of the house and into a van, packing it up, and sending them away. I watched as several movie-appliance-filled cars took off down the road I just rode up on. It looked as though they were wrapping up for the day even though it had just started. Charlie was nowhere in sight, but I did lay my eyes on a tall wolf with a vibrant, deep blue tinge to his fur, standing near the entrance of the beach house. His paws rested on his hips, a clipboard held firmly in one of his hands as he watched the crew do their work. Beside him, stood a female Siamese cat, staring down at another clipboard as she spoke to the wolf. Probably stuff of business.

I gulped and approached them slowly, my social anxiety getting the best of me.

"E-Excuse me?" I spoke softly, not wanting to disturb.

The two stopped their conversation and turned around. I saw their faces, searching for the source of my voice as they laid their eyes on me, their eyebrows furrowing with uncertainty. I opened my mouth to speak, but I was then caught off by the cat.

"Sorry, kid, no autographs," She instructed, stepping in front of the wolf and crossing her arms.

"Wait, wait," The wolf dismissed her, patting the cat on the shoulder as he passed in front of her, approaching me. "A blue-and-pink-furred cat..." He whispered to himself. "Are you Skyler?"

My eyes widened with shock. "Y-Yes, how did you..?" I stuttered, caught off guard by the fact that he knew exactly who I was.

"Oh, wow, it's great to meet you! Charlie talks nonstop about you," He beamed with a smile, holding his paw out to shake. I slowly took it, still unsure of who they were. "I'm Deno Yuvi, the director. This is my assistant, Amy," He clarified.

"Ohhhh!" I gasped, realizing that the two standing before me were Charlie's bosses. I hadn't had noticed. "Hi! I'm Skyler Clawfield, yeah."

"Oh, I remember Charlie talking about you," Amy nodded her head, reaching out and shaking my paw as well. I smiled warmly, wanting to make a good impression.

"What brings you here, Skyler?" Deno asked, holding his hands together.

"I'm looking for Charlie, actually," I told them, removing the souvenir jacket from my body, ready to hand it over to my boyfriend once I saw him. "Um, is he here?" I looked up at them, expecting an answer, only to find faces of confusion.

"W-Why... Why would he be here?" Amy wondered, glancing over at Deno.

"Because of... filming..?" I answered, a little tense from the awkward silence.

"Oh, Skyler," Deno chuckled. "Filming wrapped last week, what are you talking about?"¬†  

  

_I felt my body stiffen._

  

"W-What..?" I mumbled with a scoff, denying my already intrusive thoughts. "Didn't you have to reshoot scenes? B-Because you... lost the footage..?"

"Oh, yeah, that," Deno recalled, wincing at the memory. "Yeah, we were definitely worried, but thankfully we found it. Saved us a whole week of reshoots."

  

_I felt my stomach turn inside out._

  

"Right now, the crew's just packing up and leaving," Deno continued. "I thought I'd stop by and take one last look at the place, since we, y'know, spent the last month and a half here. Charlie does have to be at the workplace next week though, we're starting post-production then and I'm going to need his help..."

  

_Everything he said past "saved us a whole week of reshoots" became a muted, faint blur to me. It all went through one ear and out the other._

_My eyes slowly drifted down to the concrete, my hands, and the jacket I had bought Charlie, resting in my sweaty palms._

_I felt a chill run down my spine._

_It all closed in on me, my breathing growing heavy and my limbs growing weak. I started to tremble._

  

_No, no, no..._

_It... It can't be..._

  

_The world around me disappeared, the sky, the ground, the set, the crew, Deno and Amy, leaving_¬†_only me and my thoughts._

_Just like that, all the joyful feelings radiated from this morning disappeared without a trace._

_My whole world had collapsed around me and I was now on my own again._

_I was alone in this abyss of various, abnormal feelings._

_Confusion._¬†

_Fear._¬†

_Anxiety._¬†

_S__adness._¬†

_Pain._¬†

_Betrayal._

_Anger._

  

_And it was all because of him._

  

_I let it sink in._

_The whole thing._

  

_That entire time he seemed off._

_Charlie had been lying to me._

_And I had been so ignorant._

  

"WHAT THE FUCK?!" I screamed.

# 28. THE ATHLETE

\~~~  

## Jonathan

_"Jonathan Oliver Greenwood, the Athlete."_

"Am... Am I a bad person..?" The drunken and miserable Charlie whimpered in his bed, his body and limbs shaking as if he'd been abused all his life.

And it was true. He had never been able to escape the claws of his father, no matter how far away he got. His past always came back to haunt him.

I looked down at what had become of my best friend since the seventh grade. I've seen his highs, I've seen his lows. I've seen him grow, I've seen him fight, I've seen him love. I've seen him angry. But, it was rare to see him sad.

There have only been a few occasions where I've seen him cry.

"Not if you do the right thing," I answered the husky, hoping that he'd take my advice.¬†

I hated to see him like this, but it was not my place to step in. He had to take care of this himself.

Tears slowly streamed down Charlie's face as his eyelids came to close. His limbs and his body had stopped moving, and for a second, I almost thought he was dead. But, the subtle rise and fall of his chest proved otherwise. He was asleep.

Leaving the home, I ordered an Uber to take me back to mine. I had taken a bus to San Francisco and had driven Charlie back in his car, so I really had no other method of transportation back.

Once I arrived home, the sun was beginning to set.¬†

The house was empty and quiet, similar to how I was feeling a little inside. _It's not good to see someone you grew up with at their lowest._¬†

I made my way through the lobby, entering the living room and approaching the couch. I dropped my keys and belongings onto the coffee table and collapsed onto the couch, finally taking a break from an exhausting day of stress and anguish. I looked ahead, watching as the sun began to disappear behind the valley landscape from the backyard view.¬†

I grunted and leaned over, resting my head in my hands and rubbing my eyes with my fingertips.¬†

_My day off did not go the way I expected it to._

Soon enough, my wife and Becca had returned home a little later than I did. I heard the muffled sound of the two laughing beyond the front door as Claire unlocked it with her keys. I sat up from the couch and faced the door, watching them file in.

Becca entered first and suddenly made eye contact with me, her laughing coming to an end. Claire came in behind her and set her sights on me, but instead of going quiet, her smile got wider as she ran over to me and gave me a big hug.

"Woah‚ÄîHey!" I laughed as Claire latched onto me, kissing my cheek. "Where were you guys?"

"Shopping," Becca said plainly, crossing her arms and looking at the floor.

"It was so much fun," Claire giggled, pushing her lips against mine. We both kissed dramatically, melting into one another's arms.

"I'm glad," I exhaled after parting muzzles.

"How was your day, husband?" Claire asked, separating her arms from mine and heading into the kitchen. Becca sighed and marched to the bathroom, passing by me with no acknowledgment. Something about her mood seemed off, which was strange. She's never been like this in front of me before, but something told me that I was the one who was upsetting her.

"Could've been better," I responded, following Claire into the kitchen while simultaneously looking back at Becca as she disappeared down the hallway.¬†

"Oh, no, what happened?" Claire wondered, looking at me as she reached her hands into the fridge that stood in the corner of the kitchen, preparing to cook dinner. Sometimes I offer to cook, but Claire always refuses since it's her passion and basically her career.

"It's Charlie. He's going through a rough patch," I sighed, leaning against the counter as Claire laid out the ingredients for, what seemed to be, roast chicken on the table.

"Really?" Claire's eyes widened, the fact coming as more than a shock to her. "Does Skyler know?"

Reluctantly, I shook my head. "It's serious and Charlie doesn't want him involved. I disagree, obviously, but I don't want to get involved either. It's their issue."

"I... I was just with her today, I... I can't believe she didn't know..." Claire whispered to herself as if I wasn't supposed to hear.

"Who's 'she'?" I questioned, leaning in.

After I had asked her that, Claire's jaw dropped with a small gasp. "Oh, shit, I didn't mean to say that‚Äî"¬†She slapped her hand over her mouth.

"Hm?"

"It's a long story. You'll have to wait until Skyler is ready to be open about it for you to understand." Claire went back to preparing the ingredients.

"Okay, uh..." I didn't really know how to respond, so I just brushed it off. "Is Becca staying another night?"

Claire slowly turned her head over to me, which put me off a little. "What? O-Oh, yeah‚ÄîI'll have to ask her."

"Is she okay, by the way? She didn't come out of her room at all yesterday."

"Um... I... I think so..?" Claire faltered, staring at the raw chicken on the countertop, not moving a muscle. _Everyone was acting so strange today... Even my wife..._

"She was just drunk, right? That's what you told me the night you guys got back," I continued, a little anxious for our wolf friend. "Do you think she's going through something, or..?"

"I'm sure it's nothing," Claire chuckled awkwardly. She cleared her throat and faced me, one hand on the table and one hand on her hip. "Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to focus on making dinner before it gets dark." She smiled sweetly at me, pressing her paw against my cheek and caressing my chin. I smiled and grabbed her paw, kissing it and stepping back.

"Whatever you say, chef," I smirked, leaving the kitchen.

\~~~

About an hour later, Claire, Becca, and I were sat at the dining table, digging into the food Claire had prepared us. Once again, I found the three of us floating around in this strange, awkward tension that didn't seem to cease. The only sound that could be heard was the clinking of silverware and the chewing of the food in our jaws. I retrieved my glass of wine on the table and took a sip, my eyes on Claire as she stared at her plate the entire time. I looked over at Becca, who also did the same, but every now and then her eyes would shift over to Claire before returning to the plate. The two sat on the same side of the table, me sitting across from Claire so we could face each other.¬†

"It's delicious, honey," I complimented her politely after swallowing.

"Thanks, babe," She smiled, her attention turning back to the plate.

"So, uh... what'd you guys buy?" I attempted small talk. "I don't see any bags."

"It was for Sky, actually," Claire spoke up. "Sh‚ÄîThey needed new clothes."

I nodded my head and, like the other two, went quiet. I took another bite of the chicken and went back to chewing. Claire was doing the same when I looked back up. Becca wasn't eating.

"Um... I need to use the restroom," Claire announced after a long pause. "Sorry," she apologized as she got up from her seat and made her way towards the hallway that led to the bathroom.

I watched her until she vanished from sight, leaving just me and Becca alone.

Somehow, the room got even quieter. The tension between Becca and I arose to astronomical levels. I found it so weird to be feeling this way. _I mean, I've never felt any negative feelings towards the wolf, but something was so off with her tonight._ Something _has_ been off with her for the past few days.

I looked back over at Becca as she sat there, staring at the plate with her hands in her lap. It got rather tough at that moment for me to swallow, but once I choked the mouthful down, I took the opportunity to speak up.

"Not hungry, Bec?"

Becca picked her head up and faced me, caught off guard. "Oh‚ÄîNo, I'm hungry, I'm, just... kinda tired, you know," she said with an awkward chuckle.

_Oh, so she isn't mad at me._

_She's just tired._

"Oh! Yeah, I know how you feel," I sighed with relief, glad I wasn't the problem.¬†

_She's just tired_, I kept telling myself.

She's just tired.

I turned my head back over to the hallway, trying to scout out any visual hints if Claire was coming back. The empty hall notified me that she was currently occupied.

I looked back over at Becca. "Hey, can I ask for advice?"

"W-What?" She stuttered, her eyes flinching back and forth from me to the hallway.

"Do you think... that Claire and I are too young to start a family?"

"...What?" Becca repeated, her tone more somber now.

"Claire told you about it, right? You guys talk about everything, I'm sure?"

"Y-Yeah..." Becca mumbled, growing flustered. She scratched the back of her neck as a bead of sweat dripped down from her forehead. _It was probably an embarrassing topic, but I needed some sort of secondary perspective or opinion._

"So, you know that I've been undecided?" I continued. Becca nodded her head slowly. "What do you think I should do..? I know it's not your place to decide _for_ me, but... I'm scared about becoming a father this early in my life... but... I love her... so much... and I would honestly do anything for her."

Becca's eyebrows furrowed as a sorrowful expression climbed over her face.¬†

It seemed almost like she was about to cry, which caused me to regret bringing it up in the first place.

"You... You love her... and she loves you, too." Her eyes were starting to water. "If you really love one another, you should know how to talk comfortably and value each other's opinions."

I nodded my head and tilted my eyes down, contemplating her words.

"Jonathan," Becca called, getting my full attention. "Even if there are mess-ups, you guys love each other. And that's all that matters. You love Claire. Claire loves you. That's it."

I felt as though my eyes were beginning to water as well.

The tears broke over the lids of Becca's eyes and started to stream down her cheeks.¬†

"I'm sorry," she sniffled, hiding her face with her hands and sinking back into the chair.

"Oh, hey, Becca," I consoled, sitting up immediately and making my way over to her side of the table. I approached her and leaned down onto my knees, grabbing her gently. "Hey, it's okay, you didn't do anything..." I tried to hug the wolf, but she wouldn't let me get any closer.

"But, I did," she whimpered through her cries, wiping her face only for more tears to dampen her fur.

"You did nothing, Becca," I tried my best to comfort her, but there was no getting through.

"I did, I... I..." She started to lose control of her breathing and began to crumble into a little ball in the chair.

"Becs, if you ever need help, we're always here," I told her. Becca removed her hands from her head and looked at me, an expression, that appeared a lot like guilt, covering her face. "If you need a place to stay, the guest room is always open. If you need someone to talk to, both Claire and I are here. And Sky and Charlie, too."

"Please, don't do this..." She shook her head, squinting her eyes shut. It looked as though she was trying to hold herself back from breaking.

"Becca, I know it's been hard for you lately, but we can help you get through."

"Jonathan..."

"We're your friends."

"Please..."

"Your family."

"Jonathan..!"¬†

"You're never _not_ welcome here‚Äî"

"I kissed Claire!"

  

_At that moment, I knew it was right to shut my mouth._

Becca opened her eyes and saw my blank expression.

"I'm sorry."

She sat up from the chair, running into the hallway, leaving me alone in the dining room. I heard the sound of the guest bedroom door open and close with a slam that echoed throughout the hallway. Throughout the house.

I sat there, on my knees, in the same position, stunned. I couldn't move.

I didn't even know what to feel at this moment.

_Betrayal? Anger? Sadness?_

_All I was feeling was confusion._

I lowered down from my knees to my bottom, sitting on the floor. Today hadn't been going great. This just took things to a whole new level. I didn't even think it was possible.

"Hey, what's going on?" I heard Claire's voice call as she entered back into the room from the hallway. "What are you doing on the floor? Where's Becca?"

_I didn't know what to do._

_I just stared at the floor, lost in my own mind._

Claire walked up to my side and leaned down, placing her paw on my shoulder. "Babe, what's wrong?"

I opened my mouth, searching for the right words to say.

"Why... Why didn't you tell me Becca kissed you?"

Claire's hand just lightly parted from my shoulder.

I didn't see her face, but I could tell it went pale.

"Jonathan..."

I sat up from the floor and turned around, looking down at her.

The chill displaying on her face was more than obvious. It was true. Her body was frozen, her limbs stretched outward in the same position they were in to touch my shoulder. She had been caught red-handed. There was no way out of this.

"Why..? Why not?"

"I didn't want you to worry, Jonathan, I..."

"...You didn't want me to worry? Well, Claire, I'm worried! Even more now that you decided not to talk to me about it!"

"I'm sorry, Jonathan, I... I didn't want to tell you..."

"Did... Did it mean anything?"

"...What?"

"Did it mean anything?"

"Becca was drunk."

"But did she mean it?"

Claire stared into my eyes, unable to answer. Her mouth was gaping open, yet no words came through.

"Did something else happen?"

"Jonathan..."

"I need you to tell me right now."

"She..." Claire gulped and closed her eyes. _That was a sign that whatever she was about to confess to next would be big._ "She said that she loved me... and she's always been jealous of you..."

_Oh, no..._

"Oh, fuck..." I gasped for air, clasping my paws against my head, scratching my scalp. I turned around and walked away from Claire and the table, distancing myself from her.

"Jonathan, wait‚Äî" Claire attempted, approaching me.

"Do you love her, too?"¬†I turned back around and stepped towards her interrogatively, making her stop in her tracks.

"No, no! Of course, not! I love you!"

"Did you like the kiss?"

"What?"

"Did you push her away or did you let her kiss you?"

"Jonathan... I..." Claire kept tripping over her words. That made her even more suspicious. "I was drunk as well..."

"Claire, are you gay?"  

_I expected her to deny it, but... she didn't._

"I... I don't know..."¬†

After Claire had said that, I sighed and shut my eyes, covering my face with my paws.

"But, all I know is that I love _you_ and you _only!_¬†My sexuality doesn't matter! I only love _you_, Jonathan!" Claire came towards me, her arms outstretched for me.

"I'm sorry... Please, just give me some space." I held out my hand to stop her from coming any nearer.

"Jonathan, please, just talk to me‚Äî"

"I need time to think, Claire."

"Jonathan‚Äî"

"Please, just‚Äîleave me alone!" I whimpered, flinching and backing away rapidly.¬†

_I was afraid. I was afraid because I felt threatened._¬†

_I was afraid I was going to lose the love of my life._

I could see the fear on Claire's face as well. It was possible she was afraid of the same thing.

"Are you angry with me?" She asked under her breath, stepping back, mirroring my movements.

"No, no, of course not..." I shook my head, having an internal conflict with my own mind. "...I just need time to think, okay?"

"Okay..." She whispered, saddened and scared.

The look on her face frightened me on a level I've never felt before.  

She sniffled and backed away slowly before turning around and dashing back into the hallway.

I stood there, alone in the room, unable to process what had happened in the past twenty-four hours.

\~~~

I made the fateful decision to sleep on the couch tonight. _It wasn't because I felt any resentment towards Claire, nor Becca... I just needed some_¬†_time_¬†_alone._

_I couldn't handle everything. It seemed like everyone I knew and was close to falling apart, me being the only one left standing. And yet, being the only one left standing is exactly the thing that brings me down._

I turned the lights off in the living room and listened for any sounds, any sort of indication that Claire and Becca were in need of help. It was only silent. The hallway was dark, apart from the small sliver of light coming from me and Claire's bedroom.

I wanted more than anything to go back inside and comfort my wife.¬†_I've never wanted to see her troubled, but... something was stopping me from tending to her needs. I just didn't have the motivation. Or the trust._

I lied down sideways on the couch, tossing the raggedy display blanket over me and resting my head on the small pillow that served as decoration for the sofa.¬†

_Hm, I thought Sky said this was comfortable... It's so stiff..._

I sighed and dealt with it. I closed my eyes and tried to forget everything that was happening. _Hopefully, I'll feel better in the morning._

It took a while for me to find the right position on the couch in order to rest soundly, but once I did, I conked out.

And before I knew it, a dream began.

_But, it wasn't a dream._

_It was a memory._

\~~~

_I was sitting in the living room of my childhood home. In my hands, I held a football, tossing it up and down as I reclined on the couch in a lazy, laid-back position. The television was on in front of me, but I didn't feel like watching._

_Suddenly, the doorbell rang._

_On weekends, my parents weren't home, as they had shifts at separate jobs that required intense focus and time consumption. They were usually never home, but they didn't really worry about me. I mean, I was a freshman in high school at the time, I was more than capable of staying home alone._

_Besides, I was dead-set on acting older than I appeared. After all, my high school persona was listed as 'the lion who got his mane far too early'. I always hated it, but once high school determines your label, you can never escape it. It's who you are._

_I exited the living room and walked into the main lobby of my house. I grabbed the handle of the front door and pulled it open, finding a boy a lot like me, standing on my front porch._

_It was Charlie._

_He wore a look of worry and fear._

_For me, it was just plain anger._

_I didn't want him here._

_"You haven't been answering my calls," he fretted, playing with his fidgeting hands._

_"It's because I don't want to talk to you," I stated, grabbing the edge of the door and pushing it forward, prepared to slam it on him._

_"Wait_‚Äî_WAIT!" Charlie yelped, shoving his arm against the door before it closed shut. "Jonathan, will you just talk to me?!"_

_"Go home, Charlie! I don't want to talk to you!" I repeated, pressing myself against the door, giving all my might into closing it, but unfortunately, Charlie was just as strong as I was. Maybe even a little bit stronger. It was like Harry Potter versus Voldemort, our wands exerting the same exact level of power against each another._

_"Jonathan, PLEASE!" Charlie begged, tumbling his whole body into the door. I lost the battle._¬†

_The large piece of wood gave away in my direction, causing me to bail from the opposite tug-of-war. Charlie did not expect to win so easily, which caused him to fall onto the floor. The door swung back and almost made a dent in the wall behind it._

_"What the fuck is wrong with you?!" I yelled at him as he stumbled to his feet. "I told you to go home!"_

_"Jonathan, I fucked up, alright?! I admit it, I fucked up!" Charlie plead guiltily. He caught his breath, trying to contain himself, but it was obvious he was on the edge._

_He was a mess. It looked like he hadn't slept in several days._

_"Admitting it won't fix things," I growled, trying to intimidate him out of my house. "Now leave. Before I make you leave."_

_"I'm sorry, okay?!" He whined, on his last leg. "You're my best friend, Jonathan! You haven't talked to me in, like, a month! It was one mistake, we were drunk, I'm sorry!"_

_"'We' were drunk?! I was the only one drunk, you were supposed to be the one watching over me! Instead, you took advantage of me!"_

_"I didn't! I swear to God, I didn't! I wasn't in the right mind! I wasn't thinking straight!"_

_"Charlie, you fucking KISSED me!" I yelled, soon lowering my voice in case anyone outside had heard._¬†_I looked around and grabbed Charlie by the shirt, tugging him in. "You kissed me, Charlie. You're fucking gay. Don't talk to me ever again!"_

_I shoved him back, pointing my finger at the door with ferocity, making it more than obvious I wanted him out._

_"Jonathan, please..." Charlie held his hands together, on the brink of tears. "I can't lose my best friend... Please, I can't..."_

_I felt my eyes begin to moisten a little as well, but I couldn't let him see._

_"Please, just get out, Charlie..." I huffed, closing my eyes._

_"I'm so scared... I need help, Jonathan... I'm afraid of myself, I don't understand these feelings that I'm having, I need someone to help me..."_

_"I can't help you, Charlie."_

_"Jonathan!" Charlie cried, interlocking the fingers of his paws. "I'm so alone in this! I don't know how to deal with myself, I can't handle it, I... I don't know what's going on with me..."_

_Charlie began to bend over, slowly dropping to his knees._

_My eyes watered at the sight._

_"Please, I can't lose my best friend... It's so hard, now... I don't understand my sexuality, I... I don't know who to talk to... I don't feel safe anywhere, I... If my dad ever found out, he'd kill me, he'd kill me..."_

_"Charlie, stop..." I sniffled, my breath getting shaky. "I can't help you..."_

_"All I'm asking is for you to forgive me... That's it..." Charlie sobbed, his tears watering the tiled floor beneath him. "It's been so hard without you... I've felt so afraid... I just want my best friend back... I can't do this without you..."_

_I took a deep breath. A few, actually._

_It turned into hyperventilation. Tears were streaming down my face. I immediately wiped them away._

_"Jonathan..? Please..."_

  

_Fuck this._

_Charlie's my best friend._

_He has been since elementary school._

_I don't care anymore._

_I don't care if he's gay, I don't care if he fucked up._

_He's my best friend. And that's all that matters._

  

_I instantly dropped to the floor in front of him, reaching for the husky. I wrapped my arms around him and held him as he cried into my chest, grabbing ahold of me tightly. He didn't want to let go. Neither did I._

\~~~

I woke up.

I heard the birds chirping outside of the window as the early sun hit my face, the quiet, somber tone igniting the room as it glowed a deep orange from the rays of sunlight. I sat up from the couch, wiping the tears from my eyes.

I took a few breaths, grounding myself in reality. _It was just a dream. A memory._

I held my paw to my chest, feeling the heartbeat slow from rapid to calm.

I looked up at the hallway that led to our bedroom, knowing what I had to do.

I threw the covers off of me and sat up with determination.

  

I opened the door to our bedroom, making sure to fabricate as little noise as possible.

The room revealed itself to me, and I could see Claire, fast asleep in the bed. She faced the wall, away from me, preventing me from seeing her beautiful face. I smiled at the sight of her beauty, knowing that she was the one I loved, even if I couldn't see her face.

_And in order for me to truly love her, I had to accept the fact that I may lose her._

I closed the door behind me and tiptoed across the carpet, closing in on the bed. She slept on the edge of the mattress, mirroring the position where I would sleep.

I cautiously lifted my body up on the bed frame, lowering my bottom onto the edge of the mattress, careful not to touch her or disturb her peaceful rest.

I looked down at the female fox, seeing the side of her face. When Claire was asleep, she revealed an intimate, vulnerable side to her that you'd never get to see in the middle of the day. I loved waking up to her, I loved falling asleep to her. I loved knowing her, inside and out.

_I... loved... her._

After a few seconds of silence, I reached over and softly tapped her on the shoulder.

She squinted her eyes and shifted in the bed, pulling the blanket off of her and revealing her body, covered by solely loose undergarments. Claire's red fur glimmered in the sunlight that layered over her and the bed from the window.

Her eyes opened and landed on me.

Her face instantly became animated. Her eyes widened and her fur stood straight up like static electricity. She then took a deep breath in, close to a gasp, sitting up in the bed, facing me head-on.

"Hey," I whispered, not wanting to disrupt the peaceful morning ambience.

"Hey," she whispered back, cradling her arms around her bare legs, giving me a look of uncertainty. _She seemed so worried. All I wanted to do was hug her and tell her everything was going to be alright._

"Listen," I began, gently scooting an inch closer to her on the bed. "I love you, Claire. I'm so sorry I frightened you, I... I needed some time to think on my own."

Claire looked at the floor. "Are you upset..?" She assumed.

"Not in the least," I exhaled, tenderly touching her knee, sending the comfort through my body to hers. "Sure, I'm confused... and scared... but, so are you. And I need you to know that you can always be honest with me, alright?"

Claire looked up at me, nodding softly.

"I know what you're going through, Claire... and I want to be there for you, every step of the way. Even if it means you don't love me anymore."

Claire's eyes widened, her eyebrows tilting downward. "Jonathan‚Äî"  

"I love you, so much, Claire. And I'm willing to do anything for you. If you're questioning your sexuality, it's okay. I'll help you. Becca, Sky, and Charlie will help you as well. I'll do everything in my power to make sure you feel comfortable and that you're safe."

"Jonathan, I‚Äî"  

"It's okay, Claire. I fully accept you. I'll always love you, no matter what‚Äî"

"Jonathan, listen!" Claire expressed quietly, leaning in and clasping her paw over my mouth. After realizing the action she had just committed, she chuckled softly, parting her hand from my face. "Sorry..."

"It's okay," I chuckled along, kindly folding my paw around her wrist.

"Jonathan..." She began, taking a deep breath. "I'm not gay. But... I don't think I'm straight, either. But, you know what? It doesn't matter. I don't need to find out. Because I know, one-hundred percent, that I love _you_ and you _only_."

I felt the fears and doubts I had taken on whisk away into the air as if weights had been lifted off of my back. I released a sigh of both relief and acceptance, holding onto her hand tighter.¬†

"I love Becca, yes, but... only ever as a friend," Claire concluded, nodding her head. "The same goes for Sky. The same for Charlie. But... for you... I love you with my whole heart. Only you."

"I... I love you, too, Claire."

Once again, the person before me started to cry. And I had to watch.

"Look, I know how you feel about the parent situation‚Äî"

"Claire, I'm willing to do anything for you. _With_ you. I trust you. With my whole heart and mind, I trust you."

"Jonathan, I know you aren't ready, so I won't force you."

"...Are you sure, babe?"

"You've given me everything, Jonathan. It's too soon to ask for more. All I need right now is you."

I nodded my head, pleased by our compromise. So was Claire.

"I promise you, Claire, when the time is right, I'll be ready."

"I promise you the same."

"And again, if you ever, _ever_ need help finding things out about yourself... I will always be the first one to come to. Me, alright? Please, come to me." I touched my hand against her face. She took a deep breath, exhaling slowly and peacefully as she held her own paw to mine, caressing my hand as it catered to Claire's cheek.

"I will, Jonathan. I will," She declared. "If you need help, too, you know that I'm here."

I laughed again, so happy to be at peace with her again. _She's the love of my life. I almost lost her, but I got her back. We got each other back._

"I think, sooner or later, we all need help," I joked, making us both laugh breathlessly again.

Our laughing soon came to an end, though. But for a good reason.

It was replaced with a kiss.

Claire wrapped her arms around my neck, cuddling in closer as I cradled her body within my own grasp. We kissed long and passionately, unable to let each other go.

_This was my wife. This was who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with._

_I loved her. She loved me. We loved each other._

_And that was all that mattered._

  

_This is Jonathan Oliver Greenwood, The Athlete, signing off_‚Äî

"Wait," Claire blurted out abruptly, parting her lips from mine. "Oh, my God..."

"What?" I asked her, caught off guard.

"I'm... I'm not the one we should be worrying about. And neither are you." Claire's face displayed a look of dissension, as if she had just found out something that she'd never thought of before.

"...Huh?"

Claire looked into my eyes, our connection hold strong.

"It's Becca," She proclaimed. "She... She needs help, Jonathan."

"Well... shouldn't we help, then?"

"Yes. It's our duty. As her friends. We need to help her," Claire told me, letting go of my shoulders and sitting back on the bed, her legs hanging over the edge. "I... I'm such a terrible friend... I can't believe I was so... ignorant..."

"Claire, what are you talking about?"¬†

"...I made it all about myself... I never thought to realize that the one who was _truly_ hurting... was Becca..." Claire expressed, her big revelation starting to make a whole lot of sense. "She's been through so much... For several years, she's been looking for someone to know, someone to hold, someone to love... And she's been deprived of it for so long that... she doesn't know what love is anymore... so she mistook our friendship for something more..."  

"Claire?" I called her name, resting my paw on her back. She turned her head over to mine, looking deep into my eyes once more. "We're gonna help her, alright?"

"We're gonna help her."

  

We both hopped off of the mattress and made our way to the bedroom door.

We exited out into the hallway, racing for the guest bedroom.

We knocked on the door.

"Becca?" Claire called. "Are you in there?"

The silent response was enough to make us worried.

I grabbed the handle and opened the door, finding an empty room.

The bed was made and Becca's things were gone.

"Oh, no..." I muttered to myself.

We heard the discreet sound of the front door closing echo from the living room.

We both turned our heads towards the end of the hall, realizing that she had slipped out through our fingers.

_She had fled._

"Oh, shit!" Claire grunted.

We then raced to the front door of the house where Becca had just been.

We stepped outside in our bare feet, swiftly approaching the gate.

"Becca?" Claire called out, hoping for some sort of reply.

Instead of a verbal response, on the other side of the gate, we could hear the sound of a large, rusty van motor sputter to life.

"Fuck!" Claire yelped, grabbing the handle of the gate, trying to open it, but it wouldn't budge. "Becca, wait!" She yelled, hoping the wolf could hear.

"Becca!" I joined in, shoving my shoulder against the gate, trying my best to bust it open.¬†

_But it wouldn't. It was stuck._

"FUCK!" Claire whimpered, putting her whole body into it. She used both hands on the knob and tugged it as if her life depended on it. The large piece of wood pulled back a little, but the metal lock just would not open like it was supposed to. It was malfunctioning, just like before. "BECCA! WAIT!"

We heard the sound of an engine roar. We heard the ignition howl.

And before we knew it, we heard the tires squeak against the concrete. The van had taken off.

"REBECCA!" Claire shouted, likely waking up the neighborhood, but we didn't care.

"Step back!" I warned.

Claire followed my instructions, and in a way, I do so, too.

I took a step back and prepared myself.

I stared at the gate, the metal lock clamping it shut.

Planting my left foot into the concrete of the lawn pathway, I raised my right leg.

And with one swift movement, I rammed my shoeless foot against the wooden gate.

The gate swung open and slammed against the other part of the fence. The metal lock holding it closed had been broken clean off.

Claire and I both rushed out onto the sidewalk, our bare feet hitting the cold, stone floor.

We turned our heads to the left to see Becca's van, far, far down the road, racing into the distance with no sign of stopping.

Becca was long gone.

# 29. TEN-EIGHTEEN

\~~~

## Charlie

"Sorry, I think you have the wrong person," The female tiger said, closing her front door on me as I stood blankly on her porch, disappointed as usual.

I hung my head low, releasing a defeated, somber sigh from the lungs of my hollow chest.¬†

I slowly turned around, setting my sights on my car, lying dormant in the street of the town I had found myself in. I looked up at the sky, noticing that the sun was just about ready to set. I saw the beach, far in the distance, over the horizon of buildings and homes, noticing the pier that Sky, me, and the others traveled to for Skyler's birthday four years ago. I saw the Ferris Wheel turning, the metal beams barely blocking the blinding shimmer of the crystal waters. That was when Skyler had told me what he had wanted for his dream house. What he had wanted for his future.

I felt hopeless. There was almost no point in searching anymore.

I stared down at the notepad in my hand, looking at the checklist of names I had scribbled out in pencil. There were eight names written down, all matching my mother's first. Seven of them had been crossed out. With a sigh, I took out the pencil in my pocket and pressed it against the page, crossing out the last name. That was the final one.

_I'm so sick of this. I just want to find her._  

I shook my head and walked down the front steps of the porch, heading over to my car. I got inside and grabbed my phone that was sitting on the dashboard.¬†

I turned it on to find several missed calls from Skyler.

I suddenly felt a chill run down my spine at the sight of the notifications. I immediately tapped on one of them and called Skyler, holding the phone up to my ear.

It rang.¬†

No one answered.

I pulled the phone away from my ear and stared at it, a doubtful feeling of worry coming over me.¬†

My phone's home page displayed the time and date. It was six o'clock. I had to get home to Skyler soon.¬†

I also realized that we were halfway through May. June was right around the corner. My birth month.

_Now's not the time to be thinking about your birthday, Charlie._

I immediately dropped my phone back onto the dashboard and shoved my keys into the ignition, turning on the engine. I drove back out onto the road and set a destination for home.

It was a short drive, about twenty minutes or so. Santa Monica wasn't exactly classified as a part of Los Angeles, and it was close, so I decided to check off the easiest box before I went for the others. It didn't do anything to help my mood, though.

I felt terrible as always. I just wanted to get home to Skyler.

I drove down the familiar street that led to my house, where I spent my nights with Skyler, allowing myself to unwind from my tense, anxious mindset. It was a rough day, but thankfully, it was almost over. I just needed to check on my boyfriend. Hopefully, he was okay.

I pulled up into the driveway and parked the car. I took the keys out of the ignition and unbuckled my seatbelt. I opened the car door, shutting and locking it behind me as I stepped out onto the concrete. The tranquil sound of waves crashing against the shore came from the distance as I made my trek up to the front door.

I unlocked it with my keys and stepped inside, put off by how dark the interior of the house was. It was almost like Skyler wasn't home. I could only see the large windows, north of the living space, and the black silhouettes of furniture outlining objects in front of me that I could not see.¬†

"Skyler?" I called as I hastily kicked off my shoes and tossed my keys and briefcase onto the small table next to the door. "Skyler! Hey, Sky, what happened?"¬†

Like the call from before, there was no response.

I spun around and reached for the light switch, flicking it on. Overhead lamps illuminated the interior of the house as I turned back around, ready to search for the feline.

"AH!" I shouted with fear, startled by the presence of Skyler, sitting on the couch in front of me.

He sat with his back straight, bluntly facing the left wall with the TV and the faux fireplace. He looked frozen in time, lost in his head, as if he hadn't realized I was home. He could've been deemed as asleep, but his eyes were wide open.  

The sight put me on edge.

"Jesus, Skyler," I gasped for air, bending over and calming my nerves. I laughed awkwardly, out of breath, and stood back up. "What're you doing in the dark?"

Skyler, slowly and surely, turned his head over to me and stood up, timidly.

He was clenching the souvenir jacket in his hands, the one he had bought for me, his paws gripped so firmly around the collar that they almost turned white. I noticed the tear stains in the damp fur of his cheeks, plus the bags and the redness of his eyes. He looked like a nervous wreck.¬†

_The last time he appeared this way, he had gotten raped and assaulted. It was starting to bring back bad memories. Something had to be wrong._¬†

The moment I detected the worried look on his face, my whole body went into protective mode.

I unbuttoned the cuffs of my polo to loosen up the tightness of the shirt I wore as I slowly approached the cautious kitten. He looked traumatized and afraid. "Skyler, are you okay?"  

The closer I got to him, the more he scooted backward on his feet. It was like he was trying to keep a good distance from me, which I didn't understand. Whenever he appeared this way, I had learned to treat him with care and gentleness. Instinctively, I inched my hand over to his shoulder.

The moment I touched his shoulder, though, he flinched and jerked his body away.

"Sky, what's wrong?" I asked, shocked by how fragile and broken he appeared.¬†

_It's been so long since I've seen him like this._¬†_We were doing so well for so long..._¬†_I never thought he'd stoop down to this level again... But, I guess I was wrong._

"You tell me," Skyler whimpered, looking at me with a mix of anger and fear. His eyes began to water even more as his arms trembled with anguish. It seemed like he was afraid of me. I felt like I was being closed off, a thick wall being built between the two of us.¬†

After my silence, Skyler opened his mouth. "Where... were... you?"

_My subconscious tried to fight the urge to speak more untruthful words, but the actions were too strong._

"I was at work, Sky."

When I had said that, Skyler's face grew even sadder.

"You... were at the set?"

"Y... Yes."

He bit his lip and subtly shook his head.

"Were you with your crew and your bosses?"

"Yes, Sky."

He went quiet. _I couldn't stand his silence. He just kept staring into my eyes, his gaze filled with so much anger and emotion and disappointment that I felt... caged within his sight, like a deer caught in the headlights._¬†

His paws clutched the jacket so tightly that he was one step away from ripping it apart.

"Why..." Skyler spoke with a haunting tone as if he were about to break and lash out at me.

Without knowing what danger lied ahead, I braced for what was about to come.

¬†"...Why are you lying to me..?"

  

_My muscles went rigid as the nerves came back to send even more shivers throughout my body._

_I suddenly felt hotter than usual, as if a sudden heatwave had washed over me, making me sweat profusely._

_My extended hands grew clammy, stopping themselves from getting any closer to Skyler._

"...What?" I mumbled, retracting my paws back to my side.

"Why are you lying to me?" Skyler asked, his voice louder and more commanding now, yet still shaking with concern.

_I felt the walls close in on the two of us._

"S-Sky..." I stuttered, now afraid myself. "What are you talking ab‚Äî"

"No, no, NO! STOP!" Skyler snapped, his whole body closing in on itself as he screamed. I took another step back, frightened by him.¬†

Skyler took a deep inhale and contained himself, closing his eyes as he channeled his breathing.

"You forgot your jacket, Charlie," he said, holding it up, his voice breaking. "I went to the set to give it back to you. You weren't there."

  

_Fuck... Fuck, Charlie..._  

I closed my eyes and exhaled slowly, knowing that the jig was up.

_That's it._

_It was over for me. I was done for._

"Sky, wait..." I attempted.

"Your boss told me that you wrapped filming last week!" Skyler blubbered, sniffling as he tried his best to hold in his tears. _I could tell he wanted to be angrier with me, but he couldn't help himself from tearing up._

_He had every right. In his eyes, I had betrayed him._

_Oh, my fucking God..._  

"Where have you been for the past four days?!" Skyler pointed his hands at me as if he were accusing me of a crime. _A crime I did commit._

"Skyler, please," I walked up to him desperately, trying to grab him by the shoulders, but he retaliated and backed away once again. "Will you let me explain? Please!"

Skyler's face scrunched up, blocking more tears from rushing down his face. _I saw that he wanted to stay mad at me, but he couldn't fight the love he had. It upset him so much to be angry at the person he loved most._

"Go ahead," he spoke, dropping the jacket onto the floor and collapsing onto the couch. He rested his head in his hands and bent over, trying to hide his face from mine.

He was hurt. By me. The one person he trusted the most.

_What the fuck is wrong with you, Charlie..?_

_How do I even tell him this..?_

I carefully approached him by the couch.

I sat down beside the kitten, slowly lowering myself onto the cushion. Skyler cradled into a ball and looked away from me. _I could tell he was trying to act pessimistic, when really the more he'd look at me, the more betrayed he'd feel._

"Sky..." I started, not knowing where it would go. _Just tell him the truth... From start to finish..._ "The weekend you got your first commission... I visited my father... to make amends... for you."

I saw a slight twitch of his head. He wanted to look back at me, but he held strong.

"But... when I was there, I... I found out that..."

I took a deep breath.

_Here goes._

"...My mother's alive, Skyler."

  

Skyler froze. I could tell the simple sentence shook him to his core.¬†

He couldn't hold back any longer. He turned his head around and made eye contact with me, shocked and confused.  
  
"I... I thought you said your mother was dead?" He murmured below his voice like a whisper.

"I... I thought so, too... but my father revealed it to me... He's been lying to me all this time..." My tone of voice was blank and monotone, my face showing no expression.¬†

_I had no right to be sad, I had no right to be anything anymore. This was all my fault._

Skyler exhaled sharply, sitting up from the couch and walking forward, passing the coffee table and standing in front of the fire-less fireplace. He grasped the strands of fur on the back of his head and rubbed his paws into his skin for a few seconds.¬†

"Why didn't you tell me..?" I heard his voice whisper.

"Sky, I..." I was at a loss of words. I rubbed my paws together and looked away, trying to find something other than Skyler to place my attention on. "I didn't want to tell you, I... I didn't know how to..."

"What the hell does that mean?!" Skyler fretted, spinning around and eyeing me down, holding his arms out like he was begging for me to say something right. _None of it was right. None of it at all._

"You know how I get about my family, Sky," I whined back, my voice breaking with emotion. "You know how much I want to keep you out of it! I didn't want you to get involved! I wanted to find her alone, by myself!"

"Find her?" Skyler questioned, crossing his arms. _It was sad, even when he wanted to be mad and stand up to me, he couldn't help himself from looking like a lost, broken soul._

"This past week, I've been searching for her, Sky," I confessed. "I've been looking everywhere for her. All I have as clues are fucking letters that don't tell me anything!"

"Why didn't you let me help?! I could've... been supportive! I could've done anything! I'm _willing_ to do anything for you!"

"Sky! As much as I would love your help, you know what would happen," I stood up from the couch, holding my hands out towards him so that he'd be less threatened by me.

"What?! What would happen?!" Skyler pressed.

"You'd be hurt, Sky! And I don't want that for you!"

"How could I be hurt?! What about this could hurt me?!"

"_I_ would hurt you, Sky!" I confessed. "I would hurt you! Like I did at my father's place, like I'm doing now!"

"You're not hurting me, Charlie."

"I will, I know I will, I would've," I felt my eyes water as my throat clogged with suffering moans. "You know how I am... How I can get when I'm angry... The things I can say... without thinking..."

_Don't cry, Charlie. Not in front of Skyler._¬†

_Please, stop._

_Stop what you're doing._

I began to sniffle and breathe rapidly, tugging at the strands of my own hair and rubbing them into my face and my eyes, trying to numb the emotional pain with physical.¬†

Skyler watched me as I held back my tears, growing more and more troubled. He clasped his paw to his chest as if my pain made his heart ache even more.

"Charlie," Skyler blubbered, finding the strength to approach me. "I'm sorry, it's okay," He consoled, walking up to me in an attempt to hug me.

"No, no! It's not okay!" I cried, my voice crumbling with the sorrow in my lungs. I stepped away from him, rejecting his touch, keeping the space between us consistent. "I lied to you! I... I lied..."

_It was as if... the whole time I had put on this fake act in front of him... I saw it as no big deal._¬†

_I told myself that I was protecting him... but that was just another lie._

_A lie to myself that I had been so desperate to believe. To hide behind._

_Now that the truth has been revealed to Sky, it was revealed to me, too._

_And it made me sick to my stomach._

_Now... Now I know..._¬†

_Now I know how bad of a person I was..._

"It's alright, Charlie!" Sky pleaded, wanting to touch and hold me, but I wouldn't let him. "You can tell me now."

"No!" I growled, stepping away from him and the couch, backing up into a corner of the room. "I... I can't... I don't want to."

"What?!" Skyler gasped, in complete absurdity about how I was acting.

"I don't want to talk about it!" I wailed, a single tear streaming down my face and my lips getting wet with saliva. I kept staring at the corner of the room, unable to look at Skyler.

"Why not?!" He quavered, making his way up to me slowly from behind. "Why won't you let me help?!"

"I don't NEED YOUR HELP!" I shouted, slamming my fists against the wall.

"CHARLIE!" Skyler shrieked, terrified of me.¬†

"I don't need HELP! I'm FINE!" I spun around and faced him, racing up to him and pointing my finger directly at his chest. "_This_ is why I didn't tell you, okay?! It was because of _this!_ _You_ caring about _me!_ I can't _stand_ you, or anyone, feeling worried about me, I _hate_ it when you're concerned, I hate it when anyone is concerned, I _fucking HATE your pity!_ It fucking _kills me!"_

This time, he didn't go quiet or cower away.¬†

"Why?!" He yelled back, closing in on me. I covered my face with my hands and walked in circles, slowly driving myself to insanity. "Why, Charlie?! I love you! Why are you doing this?! Why won't you let me feel the things you feel for me?!"

"I love you, too, Sky, but I can't... I can't let you see me like this," I exhaled, the air escaping through my muzzle while my mouth and tongue formed the breaths into voiceless words.

"Like what?! Charlie‚Äî" Skyler made his attempt at getting closer to me again. I backed away once more.

"Please, stay back!"

"Charlie..." Skyler was crying even more now.¬†

_He wanted so desperately to help me, but I just wouldn't let him in._

_I was so fucked up in my own head. I couldn't handle myself anymore._

_I was performing actions that weren't even mine._

_I had no control over my body, whether I liked it or not._

"Please, don't‚Äîstop! STOP!" I screeched as Skyler tried to grab me, attempting to smack his paws away, though I wasn't able to make contact with them. He just retracted his arms back to his body, coiling in, and stared at me with horror as I crumbled into myself, shoving my hands into my face, the claws making contact with my skin.

"Charlie, you're scaring me‚Äî"

I didn't even let Skyler finish.¬†

With everything I had in me, I screamed at the top of my lungs, smacking my hands to the side of my head.

The sound of my broken, torn-apart yell echoed throughout the house.

  

Unexpectedly, Skyler screamed in return.

"I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME!" He thundered, hurling his hands through the air like he was throwing invisible objects at me.

"I DO!" I shrilled, the bones in my hands clenched so strictly with anguish, I almost broke my knuckles.

"Why are you doing this?!" Skyler wailed, tears rushing down his face.

"I... Fuck!" I groaned loudly, frantically brushing my paws through the hair on my head as if I was having a spasm. I almost tore the strands of fur out of my own scalp.

"Why won't you open up to me?!"

"I can't do this, Sky..."

"Isn't that the point of a relationship?! To trust?! To share?! To feel?! _You_ told me so many times that you can't be happy without the hurt!! _You_ asked me to move in with you and _I_ said yes because I _knew_ that _even_ in hard times, _we_ would have _each other!_¬†Was that a lie, too?!" Everytime Skyler said 'you', he pointed his finger at my chest violently.

"Skyler, I'm sorry!"

"Why did you ask me to move in with you if you weren't gonna trust me?!"

"I do trust you!"

"Then why did you lie?!"

"I fucked up, alright?! I can fix this, okay?! I can..."

Skyler walked away from me, entering into his own walking circle of insanity. "Why did I trust that this would work?" He ranted to himself, angrily scoffing as he spewed words out of his mouth. "Do I really mean nothing to you? Am I just an item that you can possess and use as a decoration piece for your house while I _pour_ my _fucking_ emotions out to you and _you_ don't even bother to show me the same emotion back?!"

"Sky, please, you know that's not true!"

"Do you want me to live here forever?!"

"That's your choice!"

"No, actually, it isn't!"

"What are you talking about?!"

"You _knew_. You _knew_ I'd say yes."

"What?"

"When you asked me to move in with you, you _knew_ I'd say yes. You practically _planned_ it," Skyler smiled in the worst way possible, holding his arms out as they shook with a seething hatred. "I mean, _come on!_ Space for an art studio? A bedroom the size for two? The _fucking balcony over the beach horizon_ from my dream house that I told you about on my birthday all those _fucking_ years ago?! You bought it _knowing_ I'd say yes! Are you trying to trap me here?!"

"No! Sky, I'm not trying to trap you‚Äî!"

"You know me so well. We haven't even _fucked_ yet and you already know me _inside_ and _out,_" Skyler gasped for air, laughing in between breaths like a crazy person.¬†"In fact, is that what this is about?! You can't get me to open up to you about my body and sex so you decide to make it even? Secret for secret?!"

"No, Sky."

"Are you bored of me?!"

"No..." I grumbled, clenching my fists and closing my eyes, trying my best to hold back my rage.

"Are you bored of this relationship?!"

"Sky..." I inhaled through my clamped teeth, unable to handle it anymore.

"Are you getting _tired_ of the _repetition_‚ÄîANSWER ME, CHARLIE!"

"YES! OKAY, I ADMIT IT!" I screamed at him, though he wasn't afraid of me any longer. _He knew what I'd say, even if I didn't mean it._ "I'M A LITTLE _EXHAUSTED_ OF THE _TIRADES_ AND THE FUCKING _TANTRUMS!_¬†BUT, DO YOU KNOW WHY?! Because I FUCKING _LOVE YOU!_ And I HATE IT WHEN YOU'RE UPSET! But I go through it ALL with YOU because, WHY?! I _FUCKING LOVE YOU!!"_

"So you decide to keep your little secret just for some thrill in your life because you can't get it from me?" Skyler provoked as if the only thing he heard in my confession was 'yes' as the answer to his question.

"Stop."

"Is that why you immediately FUCKED a stranger the moment we broke up several months ago?! Am I like a _cage_ to you, Charlie?! Whenever you're free of me, you can _FUCK_ whoever you want?!"

"Don't you _DARE_ use that against me! We promised‚Äî_YOU_ promised‚Äîthat we'd _NEVER_ bring that up _again!_ I was hurt and not in my right mind, and I'm so _FUCKING ashamed of it,_ and you told me that it was OKAY, so DON'T you _fucking DARE_ use that against me!"

"Tell me why then, Charlie! Tell me why you lied."

"Do I have to repeat it?! Because I FUCKING love you, Sky! Are you too blind to see that?! How did I know you'd say yes? Because I _fucking love you_. How do I know you inside and out? I _fucking love you!_ Why did I keep my mother a secret?! BECAUSE I _FUCKING LOVE YOU_ AND I'M TRYING TO _PROTECT YOU!"_

"THAT'S NOT FAIR!"

_It had come to the point where my body had taken over and my mind was completely lost._

_I kept berating him and berating him as if I had never loved him. As if we had never loved each other._

_That was when I started to say things I didn't mean._

_It was my body's defense mechanism. I had to say whatever I could in order to win. That was my only mindset._

_I had learned that mechanism from my father._

_And now, here I was, using it on Skyler._

_I had no control over what I was about to say next._

_I didn't even know what was about to come out of my mouth._

_But, whatever it was, it wouldn't be good._

_Not. Good. At. All._

"Oh, you wanna talk about things _not being fair?!_ You're _SELFISH!_ I kept my mother a secret because I KNEW how worried and upset you'd get and I _fucking HATE IT_ when you look the _SLIGHTEST bit sad!_ I wanted to PROTECT you from all that SHIT I was causing! All the shit I knew would SCARE you! Because you're so _fucking FRAGILE!_ I've waited, _so_ long for you to come out of your shell. Four _GODDAMN YEARS."_

_I didn't mean a single word of that._

_But, I guess my body did._

_And I had to pay the price._

_I had to pay the price of risking losing Skyler._

_The only person who's ever loved me for me._

  

Skyler stared into my eyes, his face and pupils redder than ever.¬†

He was deeply offended, angered, and enraged. But, most importantly, he was hurt.

_He was hurt by me._

  

"Charlie... I... was... _ABUSED!!"_¬†

_Stop, Charlie. Stop, right now._

"We got a fucking _house!_ We have _jobs_ for Christ's sake, which, might I add, are a _lot_ more generous than living off _minimum wage!_ But you're worried about a _lie_. Well, welcome to the real world. The whole thing is a lie."

_Stop it, Charlie._

"A LIE THAT COULD RUIN US!"

_Stop, Charlie._

"A LIE THAT COULD'VE PROTECTED YOU!"

_FUCKING STOP!_

"PROTECTED ME FROM WHAT?"

_CHARLIE... DON'T!_

_"ME! MY FAMILY!_ JESUS CHRIST, YOU REALLY DON'T GET IT, _DO YOU?!_ My dad was a screw-up, _I'm_ a screw-up, my mom couldn't take it and she _fucked_ _off_. My dad didn't have the heart to tell me that my mother lost all hope in both her husband and her 8-year-old son, so he _lied!_ He told a lie that I had to deal with my _entire fucking life!_¬†You got that, Skyler?! Do you understand now?! Jesus, fuck, you don't know where to _look_ sometimes! It's like you need someone to show you where to focus your vision. You always need someone to cradle you, to shower you, to love you. You're like a fucking _PARASITE_. You hop from host to host, your parents, your brother, your friends, _me_. You need to feed off of us just so you have the strength to make it through the day. And what do you do when we don't submit? You break. You. Cry."

  

_In that moment, I had realized the words that had come out of my mouth._

  

_The look on Skyler's face had sealed the deal._

  

_He was no longer mine._

  

_I was no longer his._

  

_We were done for._

  

_Oddly enough, in a poetic sort of way... we were like my parents._

_Strangely, at that moment, I had a flashback._

_The fighting between Skyler and I had reminded me of the memory. It went as follows._

_My dad was yelling at my mother, my mother was yelling at my dad._

_I couldn't remember what they were saying, but the fight lead to a boiling point._

_My father, just like me, said something he didn't mean._

_He said something cruel. Something horridly awful._

_And my mother's response was a painful slap across his face._

  

Skyler had raised his hand.

In an instant, I saw his paw flash by my eyes like a strike of lightning.

I felt my whole head get pushed to the side, resulting in a stinging sensation across my cheek.

I got ahold of my balance, pressing my paw up against my face, right under my left eye, where Skyler had made his impact.

I felt something warm and wet trickle down from small cuts between my fur and skin.

I lifted my paw back up, noticing the vibrant red color of blood stream down my hand.

I looked back up at Skyler.

His hand was still extended, held up in the air, but his fingertips revealed something I hadn't seen before.

_His claws had come out._

I watched as they slowly retracted back into his fingers as a wave of regret ran over Skyler.

His face grew increasingly remorseful.

He was terrified of what he had just done.

  

_I went back to the memory. It was the only thing I could think of to guide me to my next step._

_After my mother had hit my father in the face, my father did something unspeakable._

_He lunged at her._

_He grabbed her by the shoulders._

_He threw her forward._

_She collided against the wall and fell to the floor._

_She sat on there, on the floor, stunned and dazed by what had just happened before her._

_She didn't even look like she was in pain._

_She was just sad._

_She was sad._

  

I lunged at Skyler.

I grabbed him by the shoulders.

I looked up at the wall behind him.

I held him, ready to do the worst thing possible.

  

  

_But..._

_I couldn't do it._

  

_I stood there, holding onto Skyler's shoulders, in a position that made it seem like I was about to abuse him severely, but I..._

I couldn't.

I just stood there, stuck in that pose.

Skyler was frozen. He couldn't move.

I just heard him softly crying, his breath shaky and whimpering.

_He was afraid of me._

  

  

_Skyler was afraid of me._

_I..._

  

I let go of Skyler and stood back.

His eyes were closed and he was trembling as if I had truly assaulted him.

_He was afraid._

_He was so afraid._

  

_I'm a monster._

  

_I'm evil._

_I can't do this anymore._

  

Leaving Skyler in his place, I raced for the front door and broke out of the house.

I ran down the sidewalk.

I kept running.

I didn't know where I was going, but I just kept running.

  

_I'm a coward._

_I just keep running away from my problems._

  

_In my entire life, I never imagined I'd be the villian._

_I never imagined I'd be Skyler's number one enemy._

_But... I was so... so wrong._

_I should've always known that I'd be wrong._

_He doesn't deserve me._

  

_I don't deserve him._

  

_I don't deserve love._

  

_I don't deserve to be happy._

  

_I don't deserve anything._

  

_I had failed Skyler._

_I had failed the three things I had promised him I would never, ever do.  
_

_I yelled at him._

_I lied._

_I hurt him._

  

_And then... I left him alone._

  

_I failed Skyler._

_I failed my friends._

_I failed my family._

_I failed myself._

_I failed..._

_...everything._

# 30. I PROMISE

\~~~

## Skyler

_The house felt emptier than it ever did before._

_The house looked darker than it ever did before._

The front door was wide open, left slowly swinging and recoiling at the hinges. The porch and the distance beyond stood right in front of me, trying its best to coax and lure me out of the house and into the world.

But I had stayed put.

_Charlie was here. And then he wasn't._

And I had been standing there, staring at the door and the distance beyond it, frozen.

Ice cold.

I could not move a single limb.

I was mortified.

My shoulders still stung from where Charlie had gripped me tightly, his touch still leaving a lasting impression, though he was far from home.

_I saw the look in his eyes._

_He was going to hurt me._

_But he couldn't do it._

_Instead, he ran away._

And I was here, alone. Frozen. Tears running down my face. Powerless to move, speak, cry, or even breathe.

I was truly in shock. Nothing had prepared me for this. I never even knew it was possible.

_Charlie and I had a real fight._

I looked down at my shaking hands. My claws had retracted back into my fingertips, which were stained red with Charlie's blood.

I had hurt him.

He had hurt me.  
  
  

_We... We fucked up..._

_Never, in the four years of us knowing each other... never in my life... would I have imagined things to go so badly between us..._

_I... I want to hate him..._

_I want to be angry at him for the things that he said, but..._

_I know he didn't mean any of it._

_I know who Charlie is, and that was not him._

_That was not my Charlie._  
  

I closed my eyes, allowing the last few dwindling teardrops to drain, wringing my tear ducts dry. I clenched my fists tightly. I gritted my teeth, frustrated.

Charlie had admitted the truth and I didn't even try to help. He told me about his mother and I just freaked out on him again without even acknowledging his situation. And that caused _him_ to freak out. And that led to our downfall.

_But, it won't be._

_This won't be our downfall._

_This is now how it ends._

_It can't be._  
  

I opened my eyes and glared at the door ahead of me, the one that called my name.

I sniffled and dried my face, brushing my fingers against my damp fur.

I took a deep breath and nodded.

_I'm coming to get you, Charlie._

I marched forward, approaching the door.

Leaving the house without locking it behind me was probably a dumb decision, but what was even dumber was that I walked out wearing nothing on my feet but socks. I was so dead-set on chasing after Charlie that I had no time to waste. I needed to find him.

The sun was beginning to set as I ran down the end of the sidewalk, looking every which way for the white husky. The road was barren and the hill, in which our house stood upon, was devoid of bystanders. I began to run down the hill, clinging to the sidewalk next to the fence which restricted people from falling over and toppling down the steep cliffside that led to the beach floor below. Looking down at the beach and the ocean ahead, I scanned it for the one person I was searching for, yet saw no one, other than a few kids who were messing around on a private space of land.

I kept running down the decline of the hill, experiencing occasional sharp pains on the bottom of my exposed feet from stepping on small pebbles and weeds on my way down. My eyes began to water from the hurt, but I pushed through. As the sidewalk grew steeper, the faster I became. My limbs began to grow heavy with each leap my legs took, unable to slow down. My feet just kept moving forward, my arms swaying up and down as I tried to gain a steady pace, but I couldn't catch a rhythm. My fur grew sweatier as the blazing wind I kept rushing through blew into my eyes, making them water even more.

"Charlie!?" I shouted, knowing that he probably wasn't anywhere near, but it was worth a try.

I gasped for air as I continued to run, the hill reaching a level surface. I saw more pedestrians come into view, walking down sidewalks and roads along with cars passing through the intersections.

"Oh, shit‚Äî" I grunted to myself, only to be interrupted by a crushing pain. I felt my foot get caught onto something, a tough object, like a rock or a brick. The unfortunate combination of the abrupt impact and blistering agony against my foot caused me to lose my balance.

Luckily, I didn't go flying forward, but I did take a small tumble. I tripped over my feet and collapsed, grabbing onto the fence, and catching myself before hitting the floor. I stumbled onto my knees, wincing from the striking pain coming from my bare left foot.

I gripped onto the metal railing firmly as I moaned in torment, hoping to squeeze out all the pain I was feeling in my foot. It was like stubbing your toe, but times one-thousand.

"Ah, fuck!" I whined, catching my breath. _I really should've worn my shoes..._

A small tear fell from my right eye as I squinted them shut, resting my chin and arms on the railing as the pain left my foot at a torturously slow pace. I whimpered a little, swallowing the saliva caught in my throat. I coughed and took a deep breath, my lungs burning from all the running I did with no break for air.

"Charlie..." I softly cried.

_He was the only person I wanted right now._

_I'm so angry about what happened between us..._

_I'm so afraid of what will become of him if I don't find him... I..._

_I just want to be with him..._  

_Charlie..._  
  
  

_He's just a lost, broken person._

_Like me when we first met._

_I had said offensive things to him. I had freaked out. I had lost my mind in front of him, I've fought him, I've yelled at him, I..._

_Charlie and I are one and the same._

_He's just a broken person._

_We're both broken people._

_I can't be angry at him for this, no._

_I can only show him love._

_That's all he needs._

_I can't lose him._  
  
  

Clenching down on the edge of the metal railing, I slowly pulled myself up from the ground. My foot was sore, but I couldn't let it stop me. I finally stabilized myself and took the chance to replenish my lungs, taking deep intakes of oxygen as I held my paw to my chest, feeling my rapid heartbeat course throughout my body.  

I looked around, not knowing how to feel.

_C'mon, think, Skyler..._

_Where could he have gone..?_

_Where would you go if you were Charlie?_

I stared down at the populated area below, near the end of the hill decline, where the people of Hollywood Boulevard walked around and reminisced on their beautiful city.

_If I had run away from home, crying my eyes out, I would not have resided in public areas._

_I would go somewhere more private. Somewhere to be alone._

I turned my head to the left, looking down at the beach below. The cliff wasn't exactly a cliff anymore, now that I was closer to ground level, but it still remained a steep hill of dirt and rocks, eventually leading to the sand.

I looked up at the ocean far, far ahead of me. I saw someone standing at the shoreline, their feet in the water. Someone I hadn't noticed before.

I couldn't see very well, but they definitely had white fur.

_Even if it's not him, I have to take a chance._  

Leaning over the edge of the railing, the view of the downwards drop triggered my vertigo, but it definitely wasn't _that_ dangerous. And if I wanted to get on the beach without police or guards stopping me from entering, this was the only way.

My hands clung to the railing once again, knowing what I had to do.

_C'mon, Skyler..._

_Find him._

I lifted my right leg and, with intense care and attention, slowly maneuvered it over the fence. Now, with the metal railing in between my legs, I touched my right foot to the small ledge of concrete on the other side, weighing my whole body onto that one surface. After bringing my left leg over the railing and returning it to my side, I started my journey down.

It wasn't as easy as it looked. I kept having to plant my feet firmly into the small pockets of somewhat-leveled earth, tediously drudging down the side of the hill. Some piles of rocks and dirt fell below my feet once I put pressure on them, almost sending me plundering forward, but luckily, my nimble figure was able to stay put in a certain place and hold on. Soon enough, once I had gotten to a jumping distance from the cliffside, I made my own leap of faith.

_It's unfortunate for me to say that the myth about cats always landing on their feet is one-hundred percent false._

Once my feet hit the sand, my left foot stung atrociously from the injury sustained before. I squeaked from the pain and collapsed onto my stomach, getting an unexpected embrace with a whole load of sand.

I absolutely hate sand. It gets everywhere in my fur and it takes hours to get it all out. But, I didn't let it stop me.

I rose back up to my feet, setting my sights on the figure standing by the ocean, a few feet away from me. They were wading in a deeper level of the shoreline, the water rising up to their knees. I began to limp my way over to the figure, hoping that the closer I got, the more the image would manifest into Charlie.

My theory was correct. Every inch I surpassed, the more I recognized the familiar features of him. His pristine, white fur. His tall, pointy ears. His fluffy tail; yet this time, it was left stagnant instead of wagging intensely.

He was not moving. He stood there, with his arms to his sides, staring out at the sun as it set before him.

Something about him seemed terribly off. _I mean, something always did within this past week, but now, he just looked hopeless. Nothing good came from the sight of him, standing there, motionless. He looked dead._

I just kept inching closer. The dry sand grew moist beneath my feet, and before I knew it, it was damp and sticky. I reached down and removed my socks before they would be permanently ruined. Once I was about a foot away from him, I could tell Charlie had sensed my presence.

_I mean, we were on a private beach with nobody around at eight o'clock. Of course, he could tell if someone was there._ I stopped in my tracks and watched him, a small distance kept between the two of us.

"Charlie?" I spoke, my voice breaking the silence caused by a smooth ambiance of waves and passing winds. Some birds could be heard, soaring in the sky, but apart from that, it was just mother nature's soft humming.

Charlie's head shifted slightly to the right. He stood there, completely silent.

"Charlie..." I exhaled, taking another step forward.

"What are you doing here, Sky..?" He whispered with a sigh.

I bit my lip, not knowing what to say.

_I couldn't think of anything._

_I was facing what seemed to be a brick wall._

"Charlie..." _It was the only word I could utter aloud._ "Charlie, please..."

He just kept staring at the sunset. The back of his head was so excruciating to look at, being unable to see his face and the expression he pursued. _Seeing someone upset is a lot better than them hiding it from you. It keeps you guessing, in the worst way possible._

I wanted to come closer, but my feet were touching the foam of the paper-thin layer of water underneath me. Any nearer, I'd have to enter the freezing cold shore. _I've always despised cold water, but it didn't matter. What mattered was Charlie. What mattered was us._

I stepped forward steadily, my feet becoming submerged within the icy depths of the waves of the shoreline. It froze like liquid nitrogen at first, but the longer I adjusted to it, the less cold it appeared to be. I kept strolling forward, the water reaching my ankles, climbing up my legs and soaking my jeans, soon to reach my knees.

I made my way up to Charlie, standing just behind him. I reached forward, wanting to touch his shoulder. But, the moment my fingers made contact with the cloth of his shirt, he rejected my comfort. He didn't jerk away instantly, but he did slowly drift a bit farther into the water, deeper into the sea, the saltwater reaching his thighs. Thankfully, there were no giant waves to crash over us, but the wind was enough to cause my teeth to chatter. The sun and it's reflection in the water was blinding, but it wouldn't make me shut my eyes. I'm never taking my sights off of Charlie again.

"Charlie..." I repeated once more, following him deeper into the shore.

"Go home, Sky..." He muttered below his breath. "Just leave me alone..."

"You know I can't do that, Charlie," I stated, still staring at his back.

Charlie grew quieter, more empty spaces for hesitation. "...Don't do this, Skyler."

"...Don't do what?" I responded, my eyebrows furrowing, causing my head to strain.

"Don't try to... help me. It's not worth it." His voice sounded so shattered and heartbroken. It was like he had given up. _A part of me began to fear that he would become one with the ocean and never return to land. The thought frightened me terribly._ "I don't deserve your help... I don't deserve anything... Or anyone."

"Charlie, stop..."

"Just go home, Sky. Go home."

"I'm not going home, Charlie."

I took the chance to move closer. I tried my best to shove my legs through the heavy body of water, but the deeper I sank into the sea, the harder it became to move. I waded my way over to Charlie's side, coming around on his left. The water reached my thighs once I had reached his side.

Looking up at his side profile, the first thing I saw was the heaps of blood trickling down his face from the three open wounds on his cheek. My body tensed up at the sight, knowing that I had hurt him severely. But, something about Charlie's face made it seem like he didn't feel any pain at all.

His face was blank. His eyelids were low as he continued to watch the sunset, but it was obvious that some tears were beginning to form... Or _had_ formed for a while, but none of them had spilled over his face. He had kept them from falling. Charlie wouldn't even blink. He just kept staring.

_He wouldn't dare to look at me. He knew that I knew that it would only make him cry._

"Hey..." I attempted to touch him again, slowly lifting my paw. "You there?"

"You don't deserve me, Sky..." Charlie interrupted, making my arm halt in the process. "You don't deserve this life... You deserve someone else... Someone who isn't a failure..."

_I found myself completely bereft of the English language. I was at a loss for words. I didn't want to say anything that I had already said before, but... I had nothing else to say. So he continued._

"I hurt you, Sky... I did the one thing I promised you... I did the one thing I promised myself... not to do. And I did it anyway."

I closed my eyes and lowered my arm back to my side. I exhaled deeply through my nose, turning my head down to the water below me. The reflection of the purple, pink sky in the mirror-like ocean, along with the brisk shimmer of the golden sun, touched a deep place inside of my soul.

_The beach was a beautiful setting._

_We've spent so long sitting in that house, never being able to experience the wonder that teased us every night from the fence of a single balcony._

_And this was how we were experiencing it for the first time._

"I... I apologize, Skyler," Charlie continued, his voice still stationary at that broken, miserable tone. "I apologize for everything."

"Charlie, it's okay‚Äî"

"But it isn't. I had no right to shout at you. I had no right to insult you. What I said was... disgusting... and revolting. I'm _disgusting_, Skyler."

"You're not‚Äî"

"I _am_, Sky. I'm a monster. You don't deserve me. You don't deserve to be treated the way I treated you. I dehumanized you. I abused you. I tortured you‚Äî"

"You did what you thought was right, you were hurting and confused‚Äî"

"And you had to pay the price for it." Charlie's eyes darted down from the sun to the water below. "What kind of relationship is that..? How can love be true when all it does is hurt?"

"Charlie, you were the one that told me that I can't be happy without the hurt."

"But the hurt shouldn't be forced upon someone purposefully, especially from a loved one."

"You didn't force it on me purposefully, Charlie."

"What if I did? What if I'm just lying to myself and using the people around me to abuse them for my own well-being?" Charlie clamped his eyelids shut. "I'm just like my father. I've always been just like him and I never realized it. I just continued to lie to myself because I always thought I was better. I always thought I _could've been_ better. But, I fell into my own trap."

The silence returned.

_Something was so different about the silence this time._

_Charlie and I were from different worlds._

_We stood apart from each other, unable to indulge in conversation, touch, or even eye contact._

_We were closed off from one another. We were split into different realities._

"Sky..." Charlie spoke. "I can't let you be a part of this abuse any longer... and I don't want to cause you any more pain, but... I have to be the one to hurt you one more time in order to stop _all_ the hurting."

I turned my head over to his. "...What are you talking about, Charlie?"

"I think this is the end of us... Skyler."  
  
  

_For a second there, it felt as though the world had ended._

_Was there a possibility that this was really how we would conclude?_

_Was this was really how our story would finish?_

_Everything that we've been through together..._

_All the happy feelings, all the pain, all the healing..._

_Was it all over?_

_Would we have to split? Go our separate ways? Move on?_  
  
  
  

_There was no way I could let that happen._

"Shut up, Charlie," I sniffled, tears streaming down my face. "Shut up."

Charlie opened his eyes, his tears finally falling over the edges of his eyelids. "Skyler..."

"Shut up!" I raised my voice, my breathing growing heavy once again. I had thrown a tantrum once today, one more wouldn't break my record. "Don't ever say that again! Ever!"

Charlie turned his head over to me. Finally, our eyes matched. His were red and saddened to the extreme, just like mine. "I don't want to hurt you anymore, Skyler!"

"Fuck that, Charlie! Fuck that!" I lunged forward and smacked my hands against his chest. Charlie stumbled backward, stunned by the action. I knew it wasn't causing him any pain, but I couldn't help myself. _I was angry at him, not for what he said before, but angry that he'd try to break us up._ "Don't ever fucking say that to me! Don't say that, ever again!"

"Sky, I‚Äî" Charlie grabbed my arms, stopping me from my ambush on him. I tried to break free of his grasp, but he was too strong. My face crumbled as I began to cry, slowly losing power of my body. Charlie pulled me into an embrace, causing us both to stumble, a bit of the water splashing up on the two of us. "I'm sorry, I‚ÄîI'm sorry, Skyler..."

"I love you with my whole heart, Charlie!" I wailed passionately, pressing my face against his chest. "I love you so much, I... I love you with everything in me... I love you..!"

"I love you, too, Skyler," Charlie sniffled, squeezing me tightly. "I love you more than anything in the world... I'm so sorry... I... I shouldn't have said... any of that. Not that and not what I said to you before... Not a single word... I just didn't want you to be sad anymore... I thought I was the problem, I... I shouldn't have lied... I shouldn't have yelled at you... I... I... I shouldn't have insulted you. You're not a parasite, Sky... I shouldn't have said any of that..." Charlie began to break, his tears pouring down his face like a waterfall. _I don't think I've ever heard him cry so much in the entirety of me knowing him._

"Charlie, you didn't mean it, you..." My voice had risen up so many octaves with the fragility of my whimpering. I cried into his chest as we held each other tightly, unable to let go. _Nothing could stop us from letting go of one another._

"What if I did mean it?" Charlie blubbered, his breath shaking beyond belief. "I meant it... But, you weren't the one I was talking about, it was me... I'm the parasite, Skyler..."

"Don't say that, Charlie, please!" I bawled, looking up and pressing my paw against his face, feeling the stream of warm blood gushing from his wounds. "You're just in pain, you're hurting, you... Please, don't cry, Charlie, please..."

"I'm sorry, I‚Äî" Charlie sniffled, wiping his eyes and his nose. "I love you too much not to cry, Skyler."

The two of us laughed subtly through our meltdown. The sounds of us sniffling and gasping for air filled the silence as we swayed from one foot to another, wading in the water that had now reached our hips.

_Nothing could separate me from him now. I could swim in this freezing cold water in the winter for all I care. I'm not leaving Charlie's side. Not now, not ever._

"D-Did I hurt you badly?" I wept. It was truly impossible for me to say anything at this moment without crying. My hands were shaking as I brushed my fingers over the cuts on his face, the ones that I had traced against his cheek.

"It's just a scratch, really," Charlie chuckled once again, which made us both laugh through the constant stream of tears running down both of our faces. "You're finally learning how to extend your claws, at least."

I released another long, shaky breath that mixed in both a cry and a wheeze of laughter, colliding my forehead against his chest once again, wrapping my arms around his neck.

"What about me? Did I hurt you? What did I do to you?" Charlie asked frantically, holding me back by the shoulders and analyzing my body for any bruises or cuts.

"Other than a tight grip on my shoulders, you really did nothing to me, Charlie," I sniveled, wiping the tears from my face, knowing it was useless as more fresh ones came running down.

"I'm so sorry I scared you... You looked so frightened of me..." Charlie wailed sorrowfully, gently petting his paw against the side of my head and brushing his fingers through my fur. "I was such a jerk to you... I'm so, so sorry, Skyler, I've never been more sorry in my life..."

"It's okay, Charlie, you get like that whenever you're angry," I admitted, giving him the clarification he needed. "You become defensive and use anything against the other, uh... the 'opponent' in an argument, even if you don't mean it."

"I'm so sorry I lied... I... I should've never done this to you... I just wanted to protect you..."

"Why, Charlie..?"

"You know why."

"I don't."

"I hurt you. I lashed out at you and I scared you. I don't want you to be afraid of me... but every time I get angry, you look at me like I'm some sort of scary creature," Charlie's voice was so raspy and hoarse from all the screaming and crying that it was hard to understand what he was saying.

"You can get scary when you're angry sometimes, Charlie... But, so can I." I held my two paws up to his face, smothering his head with my warm touch. He began to melt into it, pulling in closer and brushing his head against my fingers as I caressed his fur. "But... you can't lie to me, Charlie, okay? That only makes things worse."

"I know... I know it was stupid, but..." Charlie took a deep breath and looked at me as I brushed my thumbs gently, up and down, against the silk fibers of his snow-white coat of fur. "Things were going so well for you. I didn't want to ruin your happiness. You have a tendency to care about other people's issues as if they were your own, Sky. You'd only want to get involved."

"So do you, Charlie," I persuaded, shaking my head. "All you do is put others before you. And you never give yourself the chance to be in the spotlight."

"I don't need the spotlight. Others need it more than me."

"Tell me the truth, Charlie."

"What do you mean?"

"Why are you lying to me again?"

"Sky, I'm not‚Äî!"

"Charlie, why do you never give yourself the chance to be in the spotlight?" Charlie looked at me, not wanting to admit it. "Tell me the truth, Charlie. I need you to tell me the truth."

Charlie took a deep breath. "...I don't like being in the spotlight, Sky... That's not how I was raised. I grew to learn that my life, compared to others, was definitively insignificant. Other people mattered more than me. And I loved hiding behind that idea so much that... whenever I got attention, all I did was hate it. It was a waste of my time and other people's time. If people cared about me, it would only end with me hurting them."

"Your father hurt you, I know, Charlie... But... he's not raising you anymore. You're raising yourself now. _I'm_ raising you. Your friends are. We're different than him, and even though he's still here, that doesn't mean you have to continue to live like you're still under his parenting."

"All I ever wanted was to leave his shadow... his image... but I can't escape it, Sky. And I can't let it take anyone else either. I can't let it take you."

"Charlie, I can assure you... that man cannot touch me." I shook my head and smirked. "I'm invincible."

He closed his eyes and released a small smile, which paired in an oddly sweet way with the distressed look on his face. It was a light in the tunnel. The sign that, even though we were going through hell, there was always a small glimmer of hope pulling us through. A small sense of love.

"Skyler?"

"Yes, Charlie?"

"Promise me you won't get involved in this. Now that you know."

"Charlie..."

"Sky... Please... I have to do this on my own. This is _my_ issue, _my_ battle. I have to fight it by myself."

"But you don't have to."

"Skyler. I want to."

"Charlie, you act like you're so alone in the world," I began, letting go of his face and stepping back in order to make him understand the sincerity of what I was about to say. "When it comes to your own issues, you put all the weight on yourself as if there's no one else to help you. You're _not_ _alone._ You have _me_. I'm not just the person you're trying to protect, I'm your protector as well."

"I know, Skyler... But, all I'm asking is that you don't get involved. That's it. Please. For me."  

"Charlie, do you even know what protection is?"

"Sky, all I want for you is to be safe. You're my family and I don't want to lose you."

"Charlie, you don't understand."

"What?"

I exhaled one more time and sniffled, walking up to him once again. I reached up and clasped my paws onto his shoulders.

"The thing is, I'm _your_ family. But, _you're_ also _mine_. And I have to protect my family as much as you want to protect me. As a family, we have to protect each other. But, _protecting_ does not mean _hiding the truth._ Hiding the danger. It means _facing it._ But not alone. _Together_. That's what protection is, Charlie. You were just raised with the wrong kind of it."

Charlie looked down at the water beneath us, conflicted and upset.

"Listen, Charlie. You were right about a few things." This sentence made him turn his gaze back up to me. I released my grip on his shoulders and snuck my touch down to his paws. I held his hands in mine and continued to look into his eyes. "I... I am a little selfish at times. I'm immature for my age, I act like a toddler most of the time, and yes, it's true, I do use you and everyone around me for personal comfort or emotional support. It's easy for me to break, so I rely on others‚Äî"

Charlie began to shake his head. "No, Sky, that‚ÄîI didn't mean any of that‚Äî"

"But, I'm trying my best, Charlie. Like you, I was raised differently. I was raised with the idea that... the more I hid behind my issues, the more I'd be able to hide from all the pain life brings. So, I used you. I used everyone in order to hide. Every breakdown I had, I relied on others to help me rebuild. Nobody wants to admit it, but... being able to show emotions in front of someone you trust is one of the best feelings in the world, even if you're going through the hardest part of your life. But, the thing is, you're supposed to grow from these experiences, and I refused to. I continued to fear the world around me without facing it myself, I continued to close myself off from you when it came to sex, I continued to cry and break down in front of you because... you were the only person I felt comfortable enough with to scream my heart out."

"Skyler, growth takes time, this isn't your fault‚Äî"

"Growth isn't anyone's fault... but _refusing_ to grow is. And that's my issue." Charlie kept shaking his head from side to side, not allowing himself to take this as a reasonable explanation. "And sure, you could've broken the news to me in a more... polite way, but... if you hadn't, I wouldn't have seen how much of a... _coward_ I was being. I mean, if none of this ever happened, life would just go back to being a lie. _We'd be living a lie, you and me._ I'd reach for your arm, you'd take me to bed, we'd cuddle until we fell asleep, and we'd pretend we love our quiet little life. We _pretend_ we're the perfect couple."

Charlie had no opening to express his side of the argument, but judging by his body language, he continued to refuse that I was just as at fault as he was.

"I don't want us to be that, Charlie. I don't want to be the stereotypical, picture-perfect modern magazine cover photo," I scoffed, lightening the mood to our dreary conversation. "I don't want to have a designated side on the bed, no, that'd be torture. I want it to be _our_ bed! The _whole_ thing! I don't want to have a selected space, I just want _you_. I just want to _sleep_ with _you_, not caring what side of the bed I'm sleeping on‚ÄîYet, that's what everyone sees of us. And assumes."

Charlie stopped shaking his head. He bit his lip just like I did, stomaching the idea that I was trying to demonstrate to him.

"If we're going to be real, we _have to fight_. I never realized, that all those times you told me that fighting was normal, you were _so_ right... and I denied it because I hated the idea of fighting you. And I know you hate to scream at me... and I know you hate it when I cry, but... I know for sure, that through all of this, if we don't argue, if we don't fight... we're just gonna continue to live a lie. Forget everything that happened. Go back to our cookie-cutter life. I can't have that, Charlie. We need to tell the truth. Even if it hurts us."  

"We're not perfect," Charlie added on.

"Hell, we're nowhere near it," I continued his sentence with a soft chuckle. "But, we're making ground. We're getting a foothold, okay?"

"And if we want to continue to love each other..."

"We have to face the idea of hurting each other."

Charlie sucked in air through his gut, releasing carbon dioxide with his now calm, tranquil tone. He parted his hands from mine and placed them on my shoulders, pulling me into another tight, bonding embrace.

"How did we end up together?" He whispered into my ear.

"I ask the same question every single day," I spoke, muffled and suffocated by Charlie's chest. "We're so different from each other."

"Opposites attract, I guess." Charlie snickered.

"Yeah, they do, Charlie. They do."

"How are we gonna resolve this? ...All of this?"

"I don't know, Charlie. I honestly don't know."

"We're gonna have to fight some more, aren't we?"

"We're gonna have to fight, Charlie."

"I don't like it when we fight."

"I don't like it either."

"But, I love you, so I'm willing to take the pain of fighting you."

"I love you and I hate you."

Charlie snorted, laughing quietly.

"I love you and I hate you, too," he repeated.

Charlie then separated the hug and grabbed my hand. "C'mon, let's go fight."

I nodded my head.

We both turned back and looked at the sunset, to which there was no more.

We had been so caught up in our conversation that we hadn't realized that the sun had completely left the sky.

But, we didn't care.

Charlie looked into my eyes.

I looked into his.

We both showed each other a subtle smile. Not a full one, not a blank slate. Just something in-between. It was enough for the two of us.

We both walked out of the water together, reaching the shore. Once we had escaped back out onto the sandy surface, the water drenching our clothes spilled out onto the beach floor. Again, we didn't care. We continued to make our way back to the proper exit of the private beach, hand in hand.

"Why are you limping?" Charlie questioned as we approached the front gate of the private beach.

"I, uh... kinda bashed my left foot against a rock while running down to find you," I winced, squinting my eyes, knowing that it would freak him out.

"Oh, shit!" He gasped, looking down at my feet. "Where are your shoes?!"

"I ran without shoes."

"Oh, God, Sky, are you sure you didn't break your foot?" Charlie exclaimed with concern, stopping me and leaning down to stare at my injury.

"...Now that you say it..." I murmured to myself.

"Oh, sweetheart," he sighed, reaching down and lifting me up from the floor, carrying me bridal style as he bore me to the end of the beach. I grunted from the action, caught by surprise as he held me close to his chest.

"This is the only time I'm letting you do this," I sighed, looking up at him as he cradled me.

"The other times, I'll just have to carry you against your will."

"You're not funny."

"I wasn't trying to be."

\~~~  

## Charlie

We had gotten back to the house after a long and grueling trek uphill. _I may have lightly scolded Skyler for leaving the house unattended and unlocked, but how could I blame him when I was the one who left in such a hurry?_

After residing in the peace of our home, we spent the next hour on the bathroom floor. Skyler was pressing a wet washcloth against my wounded cheek as I iced his foot with a cold pack from the freezer. It was a little bruised, but it didn't seem broken; possibly sprained at the least. Skyler seemed to feel uncomfortable with the ice, so I cracked a joke about how cute and tiny his feet were, to which he responded with a tease about my scar making me look badass. He leaned in and kissed my cheek once it was all cleaned up. I jokingly lifted his foot to kiss it in return, but he kicked me lightly in the face before my lips could make contact with his toe beans. I groaned and said I wasn't actually going to do it, but that didn't stop Sky from laughing. And just like that, it felt like we were back. For real, this time.

We spent the next few hours, in our bedroom, just talking on the mattress. It wasn't exactly the fighting we had expected, but we were happy to get back in touch with one another.

We kept talking, on and on, way past 'bedtime', and when I had taken the chance to check the clock, it was three in the morning.

Our talking lead to another eventual fight, which included more criticism on the _'who's fault was it'_ front, and the _'I despise my father'_ scenario. The fight then morphed into another meltdown, resulting in me shouting at the top of my lungs about how pissed I was at Hugo for lying to me for fifteen years. Skyler tried his best to convince me that if I was redeemable, so was he.

I needed more time to think about it.

It then became five in the morning. I had shown Skyler the letters, but I tried my best to keep him from reading any of them. They were too personal. Even though I didn't want him to get too into the situation at hand, he had convinced me to spill the exact events of what had transpired at Hugo's when Skyler was out doing his first commission. Going over the moment I had found out that my mother had been alive this whole time, I started to tear up once again. He began to comfort me, saying all sorts of honeyed words in order to put my anguish at ease, but of course, it wouldn't be settled until my mother was found.

Sky then tried to press for more information about her, but I stopped it there, knowing it would somehow lead to him joining the investigation. I appreciated how open he was to help, but I knew I couldn't let him solve the case for me. That would only hurt me more.

But then, as the long, never-ending discussion seemed to cease... the night finally came to an end.

The two of us lied in the bed, our heads resting on the pillows, our bodies exhausted and unmoving. We laid right beside one other, not bothering to pull the covers over us as we were both tired out of our minds.

It was now six in the morning, and the sky was beginning to grow lighter and lighter.

Skyler was now on the left side of the bed. I was on the right.

The sun hadn't risen yet, but Sky and I both knew that when it dawned, neither of us would be awake.

We spent our last moments of this crazy night staring at each other in our bed, face to face, body beside body.

I stared into his eyes, the beautiful pink hue, realizing that the face I was staring at... _it was the face I wanted to stare at for the rest of my entire life._

_And I think Skyler knew it as well._

We both knew this wasn't the end.

More pain, more happiness, more... _anything_ was to come.

But, what mattered was that we were here. Together. Side by side.

Nothing could take us down.

We were Charlie and Skyler.

Us against the world.

And no matter how many obstacles it threw at us, we'd always remain standing strong.  
  
  

"Charlie?" Skyler said, pulling me out of my half-awake state. "You're drifting."

"I'm sorry, babe," I yawned, stretching my limbs. "We've been awake for more than twenty-four hours now, Skyler," I spoke with a whisper, unable to use my voice. "I don't think we'll be able to stay up any longer. I think we'll be sleeping all day."

"I'd be willing to stay up for several more hours as long as I'm with you."

"Let's stay inside today. Together."

"Do you think things will be better when we wake up?"

"I don't know, Sky... but we'll try out best, won't we?"

Skyler attempted to nod his head, but he couldn't move that well. His eyelids slowly began to drop, covering his gorgeous pink pupils.

"Hey, don't fall asleep just yet..." I lightly tapped his shoulder. He opened his eyelids back up, but he couldn't keep them there for long. "Let's just spend this next whole week with each other. To figure things out." Skyler's smile revealed itself in small chunks. "Let me take you out for dinner. I'll find somewhere nice. We can eat and talk and just... have a pleasant evening with one another, you know?"

"Every evening with you is pleasant, fancy restaurant or not," Skyler whispered back. "Can we promise each other something, Charlie?"

"What is it?"

"Well... It's a promise we made before, but... I just wanted to reinforce it," Skyler said between small yawns. "Promise me you'll never say goodbye."

"I promise I will never say goodbye, Skyler."

"I promise I will never say goodbye, Charlie."

"I promise I will never lie to you again, Sky."

"I promise that I'll become more understanding of your situation and... not blow things out of proportion."

"I promise you... that I'll never hurt you... ever again."

"I promise you the same."

I would've thought my eyes would water in this moment, but nothing came. The same went for Skyler.

"I... I'm scared I won't be able to fall asleep at the same time as you, Sky. I don't want to see you drift... I'll feel alone again..."

Skyler inhaled and exhaled slowly.

"Here," Skyler spoke, using all the power left in his body to sit up from the bed and reach for something on the left bedside table. He laid his head back down on the pillow and pulled out the item he retrieved: his earphones. "Remember when you said we should have our own song?" He put one of the buds into his right ear and reached out with the other, inserting it into my left ear.

He tapped a button on his phone, resuming his playlist of soft music he would listen to in order to fall asleep.

"I think this is the one," Skyler breathed, closing his eyes.

The first song that played was a sweet, beloved melody with a soft, soothing female singer's voice. The tune of the song was enough to send someone into a trance. The girl continued to sing into my ear, detailing a scenario in which she wakes up to her girlfriend, watching her sleep in the peaceful tranquility of the morning sun.

And as the song continued to play, the lighter it grew in the room.

A beam of sunlight, coming through the window behind me, began to climb the walls, unhurriedly and carefully. It took it's time. It didn't wait for anyone or anything.

As it rose above me from behind, the rays of golden light projected onto Skyler the moment his body had grown still. He was drifting to sleep.

The sun illuminated every inch of his body, every tuft of fur on his face, making his illustration that much more tender and exquisite.

He was the one I wanted.

He was the one.  
  
  

_And in that moment, I remembered those three words I had promised myself all those years ago._  

_'Don't lose him.'_

_It was a simple phrase, but one that mattered._  
  
  

And just as the sun had risen into the sky, I had fallen asleep to the soft lullaby, lying next to the one person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

# 31. DINNER DATE

### ACT III**:** THE SEARCH FOR RESTITUTION

\~~~

## Skyler

_Waking up in the middle of the day is one of those occasions where life just feels... different._

_It feels like it's morning but there's something clearly off, whether it's the brightness of the sky or the temperature_¬†_outside__._

Even though it was the afternoon when I woke up, it felt different. The air seemed crisper and had the scent of wet leaves or fresh rain. It felt like a cool autumn night, even though it was late May.¬†

I sat on the floor of the balcony, over the beach horizon, staring out at the view. I cradled myself, my arms hooked around my folded-up legs, taking in the breeze as I watched the ocean dance along the shore.

The heavy reminders of fall made me grow sentimental with the memories of October, or December, where me and Charlie's relationship _really_ flourished all those years ago in college.¬†

I miss those days. I get nostalgia every time autumn comes around, dreaming of how it used to be.

_But I can't go back. I know I can't._

_And as much as I'd like to, I have to focus on the now._

_I have to focus on what really matters. What happens now._

  

I closed my eyes and breathed slowly, a fresh state of calm radiating all throughout my body. I was tired and half-asleep. The day felt as though it wasn't a real one, more like a break from the story. As I said, life felt different at this moment. Like it was on pause for something new.

I then faintly heard the door to the house slide open behind me. I slowly opened my eyes and turned around, setting my sights on a recently-awoken Charlie, who was rubbing his eyes and slouching over; in that same drowsy, somnolent state as I was. He was still wearing his dampened clothing from last night. We never found the chance to take them off, anyway.¬†

"Hey, you," he mumbled with a yawn, walking out onto the balcony.

"Hey," I replied as he carefully lowered himself onto his bottom, sitting down right beside me to my left. He straightened his back and stared out at the cloudy horizon, trying to get a glimpse of whatever I was exposing myself to.

"...How long was I out?" Charlie wondered, his voice groggy and hoarse.

"Don't worry, you didn't wake up any later than I did. Which was, like, ten minutes ago." We both exhaled through our noses, unable to really laugh at this moment. For some reason, Charlie and I had kept our voices low as to not disrupt the tranquil atmosphere.

"What time is it?" Charlie asked with a soft tone.

"It's probably about four in the afternoon," I estimated.

"Damn, four? We must've really conked out."

"Yeah," I said with a soft chuckle, leaning my chin on my fist as I gazed at him.

Charlie turned his head over to mine. Our eyes met.

_We didn't really know how to approach one another.  
_

_We were still in this strange state of tension. That weird phase that occurs after a big fight._¬†

_I'm guessing Charlie wanted to skip this phase entirely._

Instinctively, he scooted a little closer to me and grabbed me by the shoulders, gently and with care. He didn't want to frighten me. He then pulled me into a small embrace from behind, his legs wrapping around my hips and intertwining with my thighs. His arms did the same, smothering my chest region and locking me into a cuddle that was tender and soft.

He leaned his head down on my left shoulder, burying his snout into my neck. I could feel his cool breath on my fur as he inhaled and exhaled at a snail's pace. I closed my eyes and allowed the warm feelings to take my body whole as I melted further into the spooning, his larger body over my fragile frame. I held onto his arms, soaking up every ounce of the love and affection Charlie was showing me.

_It felt like we hadn't done anything like this in a while, and I savored every second of it._

_It was one of those moments that didn't feel overdone. It just happened. And it felt so good._¬†

No words were exchanged between the two of us. Not even a single noise.¬†

It was just a gentle embrace, and nothing more.

We held each other for what seemed to be a few minutes. But they were long, _long_ minutes. And I wasn't complaining. Every second mattered.

  

"...Do you want to talk?" I began, tracing my pointer finger against his arm gingerly.

"About?"

"...Your mom? Your dad?" I shifted a little, making sure the embrace was as comfortable as it could be. "...Everything that's been going on with you?"

"...Can I apologize instead?"

"For what?"

"I'm sorry for yelling," Charlie mumbled, his voice so quiet it was almost unintelligible. The low raspiness of it was enough to put me asleep. "I acted like such a jerk. I just got... too 'passionate'... with the idea of protecting you. You know how I am when it comes to your safety..."

"I'm not upset, Charlie, I'm... I'm glad we talked," I responded with the same level of volume. "Granted, it wasn't the best conversation..." Charlie, again, exhaled through his nose as substitution for a giggle.

"I'm still... so in love with you, Sky... and nothing has ever tested that love."

"This whole fight didn't... affect that love in the slightest..?"

"I only feared it affected _your_ love for me... but no matter what happened, I would've still loved you the same."

"I... was afraid for a moment there, but... it didn't test my love for you, either, Charlie."

"...It didn't?"

"I was afraid, Charlie. But I couldn't give up on you so easily."

"I'm so lucky... to have you, Skyler... I..."

"Let's not get emotional this early," I chuckled, to which Charlie did the same.

He released his embrace only slightly to wipe his eyes, lifting his head from my shoulder. "Thanks, you might've saved me a few tears," He sniffled with a laugh, contradicting his words. "I guess I just don't like being vulnerable."

"Why is that, Charlie..?" I looked up at him, staring at his sullen face.

"I don't know... I've always disliked it when people tried to sympathize with me... I guess I never really found an area where I could be open. Wasn't with my friends, wasn't with my dad, wasn't at home where I _should've_ felt safe."

"I can be your home, Charlie."

"You are my home, Sky."

"...You're my home, too."

Charlie smiled.¬†

He then touched the surface of his lips against the side of my head, kissing me delicately. The kiss sent warmth throughout my whole body, weakening my limbs and my heart with bliss. _I forgot how much I missed this._¬†

He continued to repeatedly kiss my head, my neck, behind my ear... _I couldn't get enough of it. I just wanted several hours of this._

"I want you," I breathed, the words slipping out of my mouth. I didn't even know what I meant by that, but Charlie seemed to be on the same page.

"I want you, too," he whispered as his grip over me tightened.

_Our relationship was still alive. Things may have taken drastic turns, but the romance was still there._

_It always was. It always will be._

_It's our decision whether we want to suppress it or... let it loose._

"Do you still want to go out to dinner tonight?" Charlie suggested as he continued to make out with my neck. "We can go late. Spend a night out in LA. There's still so much I want to show you in this city."  

"I would love that, Charlie," I responded, touching my head to his. He looked up, our faces meeting.

"We still have several hours before dark," Charlie noted, his eyes focused on my lips with a hidden craving. "What did you want to do until then?"

"Several hours of this is enough for me," I told him.

I decided to finally satisfy his needs and give him the mouth-to-mouth contact he's been longing for this whole time. I turned my body to face his as Charlie pulled me in closer, kissing me so thoughtfully and carefully. The sound of our lips softly exchanging pressure added to the balcony ambiance, making our moment that more pleasant. I lost my breath, gasping for air in between kisses, sharing the same respiration as his.¬†

_I missed this, so much._

"Let's go back to the bedroom," Charlie suggested breathlessly, breaking off the kiss. "I just want to cuddle with you all day, is that okay?"

"Best idea you've had yet," I remarked with a light chuckle.

\~~~

"Hey, Sky, you almost ready?" I heard Charlie call from the living room as I rushed to get changed in the bedroom. It was now dark, and Charlie and I were getting ready for our night out together. We had lost track of time and were now in a hurry before it got too late.

"I'm coming!" I yelled out in response, grabbing my outfit for tonight.

I was wearing a casual, abstract-patterned, oversized t-shirt, tucked into my baggy jeans with a belt to tighten my appearance up. I looked good enough. But, as usual, I always wanted to dress into something more feminine. Those urges would have to wait.

Searching for something to hold my belongings, my sights landed on Charlie's briefcase in the corner. I felt a chill run down my spine, looking at it just sitting there on the floor... holding the only evidence that Charlie's mother was still alive.

_Not now. Something to talk about later._

Shaking my head, I grabbed a small, white purse that Claire had lent me, shoving my wallet and phone in. I ran for the door of the bedroom, ready to leave until something caught my eye. The open doors of the walk-in closet had stopped me.¬†

I saw the small plastic bag hiding in the corner, containing the clothing I had bought from the store with Claire and Becca.

_Soon._

I left the bedroom and the hallway and exited out into the living room, where Charlie stood by the front door. He was bending over to tie his shoes, hiding his outfit from my vision. "Sorry I took so long, I'm ready‚Äî"

The moment Charlie stood up with his back straight, I was caught by surprise.¬†

He was wearing a whole fancy tuxedo, suit-and-tie and everything. He flapped the lapels of his tux and smirked, suave as ever. He held his arms out and did a tiny spin, giving me a dashing presentation.

"Wow, Charlie..." I stammered, truly flabbergasted by the sight. "It's been so long since I've seen you wear something nice. Didn't you wear that at the wedding?"

"I wanted to look good for you," Charlie blushed, which was something that didn't happen very often.

"You always look good, Charlie. You're a fine man, what can I say," I flirted, coming up to him with my sights set on his tie, which wasn't as fine. "What's going on here?" I grabbed the tie with my paws, trying to set the knotted-mess straight, but it was a whole travesty.

"I never really learned how to tie a tie," Charlie chuckled awkwardly. "Dad never taught me. Do you?"

"Are you kidding? I never wear ties. Don't ask the femme about masculine things," I spoke, while simultaneously trying to make the tie look at least somewhat presentable. Charlie then grabbed onto the garment, loosening it and removing it from his chest.

"I'll just go without it," he laughed, tossing the tie behind him carelessly.

"...Why are you even dressed like this anyway? Are we going to a fancy restaurant?"

"...You could say that."

"What?!" I whined, standing back. "_How_ fancy?"

"Had-to-get-a-reservation fancy."

"What‚ÄîHow much did it cost?"

"I'm not saying what it cost."

"You know you don't need expensive things to impress me, Charlie, I‚Äî"

"I wanted for us to have a nice night."

"Charlie, every night with you is nice."

"Just... come and see what I have in store, alright?" Charlie stepped closer and placed his paws gently on my shoulders.

I sighed with displeasure and slouched over in a whiny-teenager stance. "...I don't even have anything nice to wear. And I'm not going to a fancy restaurant dressed like this."

"C'mon, you really don't have anything?"

_I thought about the dresses in the closet._

"...Nope."

"You wore that nice polo for Jonathan and Claire's wedding, where did that go?"

"I borrowed it from Claire. It was a women's polo."

"...Don't you have those outfits that you were holding for Claire?"

_Shit._

"What outfits?"

"Those dresses."

"They're Claire's."

"She always lends you things, I'm sure it'll be fine."

"But, they're dresses."

"And?"

"Women's clothing."

"...And?"

_Charlie, he..._

_It really doesn't bother him._

"You want me to wear a dress to dinner?"

"It's your decision, I was just suggesting."

My eyes darted around the room. It seemed too soon for this to be happening. _There's got to be a way out of this, right?_

_I'm not sure if I'm ready... yet..._

_...Or am I?_

"Are... Are you sure people won't... notice?"

"You went to a Halloween party once wearing a dress, what's the difference?"

"A Halloween party is an excuse to wear something out of the ordinary, we're going to an _actual_ restaurant."

"Why is it out of the ordinary?"

"Because... I... Well..."

_Shit, he unknowingly trapped me into a corner._

"Sky, you know you're allowed to wear whatever you want, right?"

"You're fine with me... crossdressing? In public?"

"Who cares how I feel about it? It's your decision."

"But... how _do_ you feel about it?"

Charlie's hold on my shoulders felt more welcoming all of a sudden. He got closer, our faces at an intimate distance. He stared into my eyes with nothing but pure love.

"Sky... I love it when you dress how you want. I love it when you be who you want to be, I... I think it's when you're the most beautiful."

_Looking into his eyes, I remembered... why I fell in love with this white, hazel-eyed husky all those years ago. He made me feel good for being me. And that was all I ever wanted from somebody._

"I... I love you, Charlie."

"I love you, too, sweetheart."

"I'll go change. Be right back."

_For once, I was really excited to dress up._

\~~~

After careful consideration, I picked out a black-and-white, polka-dotted, mini-tea dress from the store bag. It would match Charlie's suit and the purse. After taking a few minutes to slide into it, I stood in front of the bathroom mirror and looked at myself.

_It fit perfectly. In the terms of both the shape of my body and... well... me._

_I didn't need a wig or anything to look feminine. I honestly thought up the idea of growing my own hair out. My mother always said the structure of my face was pretty for a boy._

_But I wasn't a boy. I never was._

_I felt better this way._

_...Sure, I'm scared to go out into public, but... who am I to let complete strangers take away the things that make me happy?_¬†

_If someone doesn't like me this way, then that's their problem. I am who I am._

_My concern isn't them. Or anyone, really._

  

_I only hope that Charlie will love me the same way._

  

"You all set?" Charlie interrupted, cracking the bathroom door open and walking in with his paw covering his eyes. "You aren't naked, right?"

"Yeah, no, I'm dressed," I said, turning to face him as he removed his hand from his head. He set his eyes on me.

I watched as his entire face lit up at the sight of me in the dress.¬†"Aww, Skyler..!"

He gasped and touched his fingers to the tips of his lips, expressing his quiet, peaceful glee. "You're... You're so pretty..."

_The way he called me pretty gave me butterflies. It didn't feel like he was trying to compliment me just to support my decisions or lie to make me feel better._¬†

_It felt like he was truly in awe of me. All of me._

_It even seemed like he was about to tear up._

He gently touched his paws against my waist, our bodies coming closer. His fingers brushed across the fabric of the dress and my body underneath the material, solidifying the two items as one.

_He looked at me in a way that... I can't describe._

_It was as though the dress itself_‚Äî_or the fact that I was wearing it_‚Äî_wasn't the case of his amazement, but that he really got to see me the way I wanted him to see me._¬†

_It was like I've been displaying myself as a female all along. He didn't judge or compare me to the ideal image of a man, he just saw me as who I was._¬†_It wasn't groundbreaking or inspirational. I wasn't some revolutionary trans icon. In his eyes, I was just a normal girl who's been dressing up for her boyfriend ever since they met in college._¬†

_Every memory of him felt refreshed. In a new perspective._

_And that's all I've ever wanted._

"What's wrong?" Charlie questioned, holding me tightly.

"Nothing, I... " I wiped my eyes quickly. Luckily, no eye-watering had occurred. "...How will people react to this?"

"That shouldn't matter, Sky."

"What do you think? About it?"

"Well, I love the pattern. The texture of the material is nice, too. This is a pretty good brand, you should get more of their clothing." Charlie then looked at the mirror. "Oh, look! We match!"

_He responded to my question by complimenting the dress itself and not the fact that I was 'crossdressing' or being 'unique'._¬†

_Because I wasn't._¬†

_I'm dressing normally._¬†

_That's what I wanted the world to see. And that's what Charlie saw._

_And that's why I still love him._

_After everything, I love him with my whole heart._

"Yeah, we match..." I tittered, resting my head on Charlie's shoulder and latching onto his left arm, embracing it tightly. Like a kid unable to leave their parents at the front doors of elementary school. "Too bad I don't have heels to accompany this dress."

"Trust me, if you did, your poor feet would be in pain all day. Shall we?"

"We shall."

Charlie and I both laughed before leaving the room.

\~~~

As if we were a rich, famed, celebrity couple (which we _really_ weren't), we hopped into Charlie's car and took off down the road, our date starting off fashionably strong. I squeezed Charlie's hand as he took control of the wheel, leading us to our first destination of the night.¬†

He said that he had a lot of things planned for tonight, which amazes me because he only came up with the idea this morning. By all means, he's very creative with his thinking.

Charlie wanted to show me the 'true core' of the city, so of course, where else to start than Hollywood and Highland? After a long, busy, wait in traffic, we parked in the mall structure and found our way to the main plaza, surrounded by blazing colors and buzzing noise. Tall buildings and attractions stood over us, cloaked with billboards and neon signs advertising stores and other commodities. The streets were filled with a diverse populace of people with different appearances and personalities. Charlie and I seemed to be at the heart of Los Angeles.¬†

_The wildness of the streets made me feel even more comfortable in my outfit. I didn't expect to feel this way at all, but... I really did feel free like this._

_Like myself._¬†

_Shedding away my layers and showing the skin that's been hiding underneath all this time._

_I loved it here._

I could tell Charlie loved it, too. It's probably why he's always dreamed of living here. He has a great appreciation for community and cosmopolitanism. It showed in the way he took photos, and I'm sure it'll show in the way he shot the movie.

I was happy to be by his side in the midst of all the glitz and glamor that made this city what it is. A million cities combined into one. I was never one for loud, sleepless territories, but now I understand the appeal. This city is alive and proud.

Much like Charlie and I.

After admiring the first impression, Charlie grabbed me by the hand excitedly, ready to take me on a sightseeing tour. We left the entertainment and shopping complex and escaped out onto the streets. We took our time to explore Hollywood Boulevard, hoping to see as much as we could before we went to the restaurant‚Äîwhich Charlie was _still_ secretive about, insisting on it being a surprise.

Taking a trip down the famous Walk Of Fame, we passed the several concrete stars displaying the names of celebrities engraved into the sidewalk. Of course, Charlie knew most of them, but I wasn't as up to date. He then played a game with me every time we passed another big name, making me guess what movie or TV show they starred in. If it wasn't an actor, he would make me guess something about their career. I got most of them wrong, _obviously_, only for Charlie to give me a whole history briefing about the person. _God, he really is a film nerd._

I told Charlie that if it weren't so noisy and crowded, Calico would love it here. He's obsessed with anything bright and shiny, and these streets were nothing but.

We then stopped by several attractions. We didn't actually enter, we couldn't really afford admission (since Charlie had apparently spent so much on dinner reservations), but instead admired them from the sidewalk outside. We passed by the TCL Chinese Theater and paused to appreciate all the signatures and pawprints from history pressed into the cement. The two of us also crossed paths with a few museums, like the Ripley's Believe It Or Not attraction, or the wax museum‚Äîwhich had a very creepy statue of Marilyn Monroe out in front. It kind of freaked me out so we kept moving.¬†

As time began to run out, Charlie checked the clock on his phone and decided it was time to head back. We returned to the mall structure and got back into Charlie's car, ready to take off to our final destination.

Charlie and I spent the whole drive laughing about some of the strangest things we saw on those streets. We turned up the radio and tried to guess the lyrics of popular songs we've never heard of on the fly and sing them in tune. I opened the car window and stuck my head out, screaming into the heavy wind blowing through my fur.

I haven't had this much fun with him in a while.

I missed feeling this way with Charlie. I was glad we had the chance to get it back. Our relationship felt renewed.¬†

_Charlie and Skyler were back._

As we drove further from Hollywood, Charlie asked me to close my eyes. Instead, I rolled them, wondering why he was so prominent on the surprise factor.¬†

We were already having such a good time, I didn't know how the night could possibly get better.

_...It wouldn't._

\~~~

"Alright, you still have your eyes closed?" Charlie asked as he seemingly pulled up into some sort of driveway. _Of course, I couldn't see, so I had to base all my assumptions on sound._

"Yup," I sighed, pretending to act annoyed.

"Good girl," Charlie remarked as I heard the sound of him taking the keys out of the ignition and opening the car door. _I felt myself smile subtly at the overly-cheesy saying. Charlie continued to make me feel good._

By the sound of it, Charlie had crossed over to the other side of the car. The passenger seat door opened and I instinctively tried to reach for Charlie. Luckily, he caught me in his arms before I made any fateful movements, wrapping them around me as he guided me out of my seat. He closed the door behind us and cupped his hands over my closed eyes.

He turned my body in a certain, specific direction and stood behind me, setting up the surprise. "Ready?"

"Just do it!" I giggled with excitement.

"Okay..." Charlie whispered.

He then flung his hands away from my face, allowing me to open my eyelids.

_Holy shit..._

In front of me, I saw this massive, elegant building. From the front of it, it seemed to be shaped like a triangle, and the two of us were standing at the sharpest point. I gasped at the sight. It looked like the exterior of a giant, Victorian ballroom, with gleaming golden surfaces, spiraling intricate architecture, firm and chiseled stone walls, shining crystal lamps, overhead balconies, and large, solid letters spelling out the name of the restaurant.

My mouth dropped at the sight. It looked nothing like the scenery from LA. This building _defined_ the words 'rich', 'wealthy', 'luxurious', 'classy', 'lavish'‚Äî_all_ the words that described opulence could be seen in this establishment. I couldn't imagine what it looked like on the inside.

"What do you think?" Charlie questioned, hoping for a good response.

I immediately turned around and stared at him, dead-on. "I think I'm still under-dressed..."

Charlie and I then burst out into laughter. I fell into his torso and rested my head against his chest, hugging him strongly. He hugged me back and kissed me on the head. "This is insane, Charlie... How did you even‚Äî"

"Just wait, you haven't seen the inside yet." Charlie pointed to the front door, where other older, more refined-looking adults were entering, wearing extravagant attire.

_Oh, Jesus..._

"Oh, Jesus," I moaned as Charlie took my hand, leading me towards the entrance.

As we walked through the expertly-crafted glass doors into the sumptuous lobby, I could see the dining area just ahead. It was filled to the brim with wealthy-looking adults, just like the people who were ahead of us and now in line in front of us. The majority of the customers here seemed to be over forty years old, which made me feel as though the two of us were a little out of place. We were probably the youngest ones in here. And the least wealthy.

Apart from the people, the interior of the restaurant was just as gorgeous as the outside, if not more. The whole place was lit by crystal chandeliers and fresh candlelight, providing a warm, whitish-yellowish glow to the atmosphere. Every table was decked out with pure white tablecloths, an organized placement of plates, napkins, and menus, clear glistening glasses, and lush silverware. It was grand, sparkling, and beautiful. Just like a movie.

"How did you even afford this?" I asked Charlie, making it clear I was grateful for the things he did for me.

"I have a job, don't I?" Charlie squeezed my hand as we walked up to the older man at the front desk. The other people ahead of us were now finding their seats. "Reservation for Charlie Cooperton?"

The man looked up at Charlie and smiled, then peering into what seemed to be a book of listed names. "Ah, yes. You'll be seated shortly‚Äî"

The man then looked at me.

His smile faded almost immediately and his eyebrows furrowed.

"...One second," The man said after his long and awkward pause, setting his book down at the desk and walking over to a few waiters who stood in the dining area of the restaurant.

_...What?_

My body suddenly felt a little heated, enough to break a sweat.¬†

I felt my paw interlock with Charlie's even tighter.

_It was like a defense mechanism. Nothing bad happened yet, but I had a hunch. Things didn't seem right._¬†

"What was that about?" Charlie mumbled to me sarcastically, leaning in.

"I... I don't know..."

_And just like that, my biggest fear had activated._

I looked down at the dress I was wearing and felt the tightness of it begin to constrict and choke me. _I suddenly had the urge to change out of it, but... I couldn't._

My eyes darted back up to the packed dining area, filled with all those older, wealthy people who probably have many _different_ mindsets and much _stronger_ opinions than _my_ generation.  

_Oh, fuck..._

"You okay?" Charlie wondered, placing his paw on my shoulder.

"Huh?" I looked up into his eyes. They were concerned. He always knew whenever I was okay and... when I wasn't. "Yeah, I'm fine." I smiled awkwardly.¬†

_I didn't want to let him down after he had already spent so much on me._

"Are you sure‚Äî?" Charlie attempted, only to be interrupted by a waiter.

"Come with me, please," the woman said, again, not anywhere in me and Charlie's age range. She didn't even appear polite. _She looked a little upset, too. Disturbed, almost. Offended._

The woman marched away in an opposing direction, not bothering to wait for me.

Charlie took my hand again and gave me an assuring look before following. _He had no idea._

The woman sat us at a small, round table, made for two. Sweet enough for a date night, _if only this place didn't scare me so much._¬†

As we took our seats, she took the menus from the tabletop and walked off.

"Did she just..?" Charlie scoffed as he removed his black tuxedo jacket from his shoulders, placing it over his chair.

"What?"

"Nevermind. She was probably just cleaning up."

I nodded my head and took a deep breath, exhaling through my nose a little too harshly. I tried to hold a smile for Charlie, but as usual, he could read me like a book. My timid figure was enough to make Charlie worried.

"Hey, you don't seem okay," Charlie noted anxiously, holding his hand out on the table. His instincts were activated and he was more than ready to comfort me if I needed it.

"I'm okay, Charlie," I assured him, reaching out and resting my paw on his.

I looked around, hoping that no one was paying attention.

_I was wrong._

I saw several people from tables far away from us, staring in our direction. Staring at _me_ in particular.¬†

An elder woman shook her head. Another man rubbed his temples and rolled his eyes.

I felt my courage to remain calm crumble like a piece of paper in water.

"Sky?" Charlie called, leaning in and lowering his voice. "Are you uncomfortable?"

I opened my mouth, not knowing what to say. I didn't want to ruin things when he was already so excited.

"No," I told him plainly. I fixed my body language and straightened my back, widening my fake smile once again. "No, I'm, just... You really didn't have to do all this for me, Charlie."

Charlie sat back and looked at the table, which oddly had nothing of use on it. It had been cleared by that waiter for _some_ purpose.

"I want... to be the best for you, Sky."

"You are, Charlie. You are." It was my turn to lean in. "Anything you do, I would've been happy with. _Anything_. I just really wish you didn't have to spend so much money to make me happy, I already am."

Charlie bit his lower lip and shrugged. "I just wanted us to have a... I don't know, a nice night."

"It has been, Charlie."

"Do you... not like the restaurant?"

"No, no!" I immediately denied, shaking my head. "It's beautiful, really! It's... It's incredible, Charlie. Thank you."

Charlie's subtle smile returned.

"I love you," he spoke softly.

"I love you, too," I whispered.

  

Strangely, it was awkward between us.¬†

For the first time in years, it was awkward.

Charlie laughed randomly and scratched the back of his head, turning around in his chair and scanning the dining area. "Where is that waiter?"

Trying to get my mind off of the onlooking bystanders, I suggested something I will probably regret. "Do you want to talk? To fill the time?"

"About what?"

"About you and... what you're going through."

Charlie let go of my hand, not in a disrespectful way, but in a calm manner. He looked down at the floor and continued to itch the same spot on the back of his neck.

"...I kinda wanted to go tonight without thinking about it."

I nodded my head, still not knowing what to say next. "Um... When do you go back to work?"

"Post-production starts next week. Not as hard as the filming process. In fact, it's probably the best part. Watching all the hard work come together on screen."

"...Are you still gonna... you know... search for her?"

I could tell Charlie didn't want to talk about this.

"Yeah, of course, I am, but... I wanted a break. To spend time with you."

"Didn't you say you had a week to find her?"  

"...And?"

"The week's almost over."

Charlie's eyebrows shifted downwards. His eyes met mine.

"...You're more important."

  

Again, I was at a loss for words.¬†

_What he had said made me feel happy, but..._

_The atmosphere between us has never felt weirder._

_I didn't know if we were supposed to be happy... or upset... or awkward... It was just flat-out confusing. The two of us were dead silent._

"Are you sure you don't need help?" I attempted.

"No, Sky, I told you, I want to do this alone." Charlie shook his head and moved in closer with his chair.

"I can at least support you!" I subtly begged below my breath. "I feel like I don't help‚Äî"

"You do, Sky. You've been the greatest help." Charlie leaned his arms down on the table, getting even closer.

"I haven't even known about it all until yesterday‚Äî"

"‚ÄîI'm sorry, Sky, I told you‚Äî"

"‚ÄîNo, no‚ÄîI wasn't accusing you of anything‚Äî"

"‚ÄîCan we just... talk about it another time? I don't want to ruin tonight."

I gulped down the saliva left in my throat. I shifted my bottom jaw around, pretending to chew on a non-existent item. "...Do you think we'll ever be able to talk about this without arguing?"

"...In the right mindset, we can. Now isn't a good time."

"I feel like it's the perfect time."

"...Where the fuck is the waiter?" Charlie laughed, breaking the tension as he leaned back in his chair, shifting his head around.

I didn't feel relieved, though.

I sighed and bit my bottom lip as he had done before. My forehead began to ache with the strain of my eyebrows. We both wore conflicted expressions, yet, the two of us didn't know whether to _feel_ conflicted or not.

_I had no idea what was going on, but it wasn't great._

Charlie could tell I was a little lost.

He leaned back in and stared at the tablecloth, not making eye contact.

"Sky, look... I really _want_ to talk to you about it..." He held his hands together, a shift in tone being created in the atmosphere. "But, yesterday... I got so violent and angry and... you looked _so_ afraid of me. I felt horrible. I... I wanted for us to have some time to work on getting better before we had _that_ conversation again. I want you to be safe, Sky... But, with me, right now... I don't feel like you are."

"...Charlie, I am safe with you."

"What if I lash out again?" Charlie whispered so lightly I could hardly hear.

"We'll make sure it won't happen anymore. We'll find a way to get better, the both of us."

"But... how do I know I won't hurt you in the process?"

  

Once again, silence.

We both stared into each other's eyes, not knowing what to say.

I don't think we could even say anything this time.

Our heads were now officially empty.

  

That was when another waiter came. He also had a similar expression to the man at the front desk and the woman who tended to us earlier. Charlie and I separated and leaned back into our chairs, breaking the strange connection between us.

"Um... are we ordering or starting with drinks?" Charlie asked the waiter with an awkward chuckle.

The waiter didn't say anything.¬†

Hesitantly, he leaned down towards Charlie and held his paw up to cover his mouth.

He whispered something into Charlie's ear.

  

The color drained from Charlie's face.

  

"What?" Charlie blurted aloud, backing himself away from the waiter.

He looked shocked.

Shocked and _disgusted_.

The waiter stood back, seemingly upset. Like he had delivered bad news that he _really_ did not want to deliver.¬†  

"What..?" I spoke up nervously.

"I'm sorry, sir, we'll get you a refund‚Äî" The waiter whispered.

"‚ÄîI'm sorry, what the fuck?" Charlie snorted scornfully.

"Please do not swear in this establishment, sir."

More people began to stare.

"Charlie, what's going on?" I asked softly, not wanting to cause a scene.

The waiter turned to me and took a deep breath. He didn't want to be doing this.

He stepped closer to me and leaned in, speaking in a low voice.¬†

"The presence of you two is making some customers uncomfortable, so I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave."

  

I felt my gut sink with doom.

Charlie looked horrified.

He looked offended.

_He looked angry._

  

"What about us is making people 'uncomfortable'?" Charlie interrogated the waiter, the tensions rising in him like a kettle on a stove.

"I told you, sir‚Äî"

"You want to say what you told me to their face?" Charlie pointed at me.

"I'm sorry," the waiter said, standing back from the two of us.

_I could only guess why we were being thrown out._

_Hm. I would've thought LA to be more accepting._

I could see the rage in Charlie's eyes. "You're 'sorry'?!"

"Charlie, let's just go..." I prayed that he would listen, but no.

There was no stopping him when he was upset.

"No, _I'm_ sorry, I don't accept this," Charlie fumed, turning his whole body in the direction of the waiter. _I began to see the side of him that resembled his father come out._ "I paid money for this table. We barely even stayed here for a minute. How have people _already_ complained?"

"Sir, please lower your voice‚Äî"

"Who complained about us?" Charlie began to growl.¬†

_He hadn't_¬†_fully_¬†_raised his voice yet, but I knew that the longer this went on, there would soon be a climax._

"Charlie, please‚Äî" I reached out for his hand.

"I am not allowed to say‚Äî" The waiter tried to reply.

"Bullshit, your staff took one look at us and decided to reject us service _I paid for!"_

I held onto his hand tighter. "Charlie, please don't do this‚Äî"¬†

"No, Sky!" Charlie turned his attention to me. I saw the fury in his eyes... _as well as the tears. They were starting to build up. So were mine._ "I won't allow you to be _treated_ like _this!"_

"Then let's leave..!" I pleaded, still with my voice at a soft whimper.

"This is fucking unbelievable!" Charlie seethed, his voice now risen to a borderline yell. His energy was at a boiling point. Everyone was starting to stare. Almost the whole room was.

I felt myself shrink in the seat, the fear and stress overcoming me. Overwhelming me. Taking me down and crushing me.

"I'll get the manager," the waiter said as an excuse to leave us, quickly dashing away towards one of the back rooms.

"Yeah, get the manager!" Charlie called out after him, enraged, standing up from the table. "How dare you! Fucking asshole!"

Two other waiters ran up to Charlie from behind, asking him to lower his voice and sit down or else they'd have to throw us out. Other staff members took a few steps closer, prepared to take action if anything bad had occurred.

"Charlie..." I sniffled, hiding my face as I sunk lower into the seat. _I just want to disappear._

"I don't fucking believe this!" He tried to complain to the other waiters. They all said different things to him. Nothing helped.

_I didn't remove my hands from my face. I didn't want to look._

_If I did I would just see thousands of eyes. Staring at us._

_I was too afraid to move. My body tensed up and shivered._

_I felt embarrassed and ashamed. I wanted to hide my body. I wanted to tear this stupid dress off and run away. I_¬†_just_¬†_wanted to fucking disappear._

The sound of Charlie's ranting grew muffled in my head. I tried to block out everything. Pretend I wasn't here. Everything around me became a blur.

_From what I could hear, I guess the manager came. Whoever owned the restaurant, or, whoever was in a place of authority, came over and tried to sort things out, I think. Charlie's muffled fury didn't die down though, so I guess they didn't do anything to help._

_Whatever._¬†

_I just want to go home._

  

I felt a paw grab my arm. The palm of Charlie's hand was so familiar that I knew instantaneously that it was his.

"We're going, Sky," Charlie stated firmly.

_Thank God._

I immediately sat up and clamped myself onto his side, not opening my eyes once as we stormed out of the restaurant together.

_So much for our night out._

  

  

# 32. SELF-PORTRAIT

\~~~

## Charlie

_Once again, I've ruined everything._

The drive home was quiet.

All that could be heard was the wind on the outside of the glass, blowing against the sides of the vehicle.¬†

It was late at night and the road was empty; soon not to be as we drove back into Hollywood, but for now, it was just plain silence.

I couldn't bring myself to look at Skyler. I couldn't bring myself to face all the pain I've caused them.

They were silent as well.

_He must've been traumatized... or hurt... or even broken._

_I wanted to apologize so badly._

_I wanted to hold him and tell him how sorry I felt._

_Those fucking assholes messed with my boyfriend and..._

_Now, I can't even look at him._

_It would only remind me of how terribly I messed things up._

_For, like, the millionth time._

_Classic Charlie._

Even though I never looked over, I knew he wasn't staring at me. Skyler's head faced the window at all times. So did mine.

_Lately, all this rage built up inside of me has just been gushing out like blood from a wound._

_And I've been taking it all out on Skyler._

_What a terrible, awful, horrible person I am to do this to them._

_I, somehow, continue to be the worst boyfriend ever. And maybe I always will be._

I clutched the wheel excruciatingly tight with all the hate I had towards myself. I wanted to yell and call myself vulgar insults, but I knew it would scare Skyler even more than they already were.

_The whole time I was yelling at those people, I don't even think I was upset with them._¬†

_I was angry with myself, and myself only. I made the decision to go there, and I made the decision to ruin everything. Just like always._

_It's not fair for Skyler to be tethered to me like this._

_It's not fair..._

_It's..._

I quickly wiped my eyes before Skyler noticed.

I felt my nerves act up and shake abruptly. The joints in my body began to sting jaggedly. My nostrils flared as I tried to contain my short temper.¬†

_But, this wasn't another fit of anger, no... It feels different._

_...I feel like throwing up._

I shifted myself in the seat, my whole body increasingly growing uncomfortable.

My stomach began to turn and my head grew woozy.

My palms secreted sweat. I suddenly felt afraid at the steering wheel, like this out-of-the-blue migraine might be the cause of a fatal crash.

_I can't let that happen to Skyler._

Using all the power remaining¬†inside of me after this brutal night, I controlled myself. I felt like I was on the brink of crumbling into a million pieces, but I held strong for Sky.

I held strong all the way back home.

Even then, no word was spoken between us.

  

The exact moment I parked the car in our driveway, I exited the vehicle and marched hurriedly‚Äîbut not frantically as to not disturb Sky‚Äîto the front porch. Skyler followed slowly behind, taking their time.¬†

_I understand why he was so... lost. I would be too if I didn't feel the need to swallow a whole bottle of Tylenol. Nothing made sense anymore._

_Life continued to do everything in its power to keep us apart._

_Or was that just me?_

  

The second I unlocked the door, I made a panic-stricken dash for the bathroom once I was out of sight from Skyler.¬†

_I felt overheated._

_I needed cool water to hit my face before I fainted._

I barged into the bedroom and ran straight into the bathroom, shutting the door behind me as I flicked the lights on. I smacked the faucet handle and watched the water spurt and pour down from the tap. _Something about this reminded me of a similar occurrence not too long ago._

I splashed the water onto my face vigorously, hoping to clear away the staggering pain, but of course, it did almost nothing.  

I couldn't breathe. I kept gasping for air desperately, my senses relentlessly attacking my head. I tried to keep the noise down but I couldn't handle it. I felt like I was choking, a noose slowly tightening around my neck and my body as a whole. A snake trapping me within its grasp, slithering all around me.

I kept drenching my face with the cold water. It became like a drug, the feeling refreshing for a few seconds until the suffocating pain came back not even a minute later.

Glancing up shortly at the mirror, I saw my soaked face, eyes red and dampened. I didn't know whether it was because of the water or that I was crying.

"Charlie?" I heard Skyler's voice to the right of me. He was standing in the doorway. He had found me.

I froze.

I stood there, hunched over the sink, my back bent, my arms resting on the wet counter, staring at the water going down the drain.

_Sky can't see me like this._

_It's him we should be worrying about._

_Not the other way around._

_I can't let him see me like this._

Skyler, like me, didn't move. They were also frozen, unable to enter the bathroom.

There was an invisible gate between us, keeping us apart.  

"Are you okay?" Skyler's frail, shaken voice spoke.

_No, no, he shouldn't be asking me if I'm okay, it has to be the other way around, it has to be._

"I'm fine," I brought myself to say, not daring to look up at him. Well, I didn't exactly say it. It was more like a voiceless mumble.

_Please, just give me some space, Sky... Then I'll do anything in my power to make it up to you, I promise._

Skyler went quiet. They took one step closer into the bathroom.

"No, you're not."

_...He didn't sound as shy as before._

"...I'm _fine_, Skyler," I repeated, assuring him, still staring down into the sink and the marble counter. I closed my eyes and rubbed my temples with one hand, water droplets releasing from my fingers.

"You're not."

_No, Sky, please, stop worrying about me._

"Are _you_ okay?" I flipped it around, slightly glancing my eyes to the right, yet not picking my head up from the sink. All I could see was his feet. He had taken his shoes off.

"Answer _my_ question, Charlie."

"I did."

"Not truthfully."

_Fuck. Please, not now._

_Not ever._¬†

_I can't do this._

"I'm telling you, I'm fine‚Äî"

"You're not fine."

_Please, Skyler, please._

_Please._

"I am."

"You're _not."_ Skyler began to raise their voice.

"I'm okay, Skyler, you don't need to‚Äî"

"Stop saying that!"

"I'm telling you the truth!"

"You're not!"¬†Skyler began to yell.

"I'm _fine_, Skyler! That's _enough!"_

"You're _not_ _fine_ so stop saying you're _FUCKING FINE!"_¬†

  

It was painfully quiet after that.

His voice was already so ruined and scratched from the night we had that when he'd screamed, he didn't even sound angry. He was just sad.

He was just so, _so_ sad.

And now it was time for him to express it.

"You don't talk to me anymore!"¬†Skyler whimpered, wiping his face and sniffling gently. "You never do! I don't even know who you are anymore!"

I didn't do anything. I just stared into the sink like an asshole.

"I'm sorry..." I croaked, the volume of my voice lower than anything I've ever heard before. _I can't believe that's all I can say to him._

"Don't say sorry! Just..." Skyler paused, choked up. He continued to cry vocally, the soft, silent wailing cutting like knives through my skin. "...Just talk to me, Charlie... I'm begging you to just talk to me... like a person..."

"...I'm sorry."

"Stop fucking saying sorry! Stop apologizing! Why are you apologizing?!" Skyler mewled as if he were on his knees, pleading.¬†

It was as if this were my last chance.

And yet, I didn't say a thing.

The tap water rushing down was currently the only sound in the room.

I could tell Skyler was waiting for me to say something. Anything. But I didn't.

I didn't know what to say.

"Charlie!" Skyler begged.

"I'm so sorry, Skyler, for everything..."

"Stop! Just fucking look at me!" Skyler, in desperation, ran forward and grabbed me weakly by the arm, trying his best to tug me away from the sink, but nothing could shake me.

"I'm... sorry..."

Skyler let go and grunted, scowling distastefully, turning his back to me. He rubbed his face with his paw, trying to get a grip of his emotions. They were one of the hardest things he could ever attempt at controlling.

"You know... the worst part of this is that I'm not even mad!" Skyler scoffed, unable to act sad anymore. "I can't be fucking angry with you! I love you too much for that... and that sucks because I have every fucking right to be pissed with you! I have every right to hate you right now! But _I can't!_ Because I love you so much, it _hurts!_ It hurts because I _know_ you're in pain and I _know_ you're suffering but... I can't even see you anymore!" Skyler held his arms out in my direction, his hands suspended in mid-air as if he was holding a transparent ball. "I can't see you, Charlie! I can't _see_ _you!_ I just see a person! A fucking _stranger!_ HIDING from me!"

"I'm sorry‚Äî"

"Who _are_ you?! You're not Charlie. I _love_ Charlie! I love _him!_ The person that used to feel safe with me! So much that he would tell me _everything! Where_ did he go?! Who the _fuck_ is standing in front of me?! Because it's _not_ Charlie."

The migraine was now beginning to fester. I cradled my head, covering my ears. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I‚Äî"

"I can't stand this anymore!"

"Skyler, I'm sorry‚Äî"

"Why are you hiding from me?"

"I'm sorry‚Äî"

"Why are you hiding behind a fucking apology?"

"I... I‚Äî"

"Please just give me Charlie back!"

"I..."

"This isn't you! Charlie, just come back to me!"

"I'm sorr‚Äî"

"I love you, Charlie!"

"I'm‚Äî"

"Just come back..."

"I'm sorry‚ÄîI'm SORRY‚ÄîI'M _SORRY!"_ I shouted at the top of my lungs, violently smashing my hands against the counter in a frenzy.

_Skyler had shut his mouth immediately. But he wasn't afraid of me._

_I was._

I felt like my whole body had a spasm.

I tripped over my own feet and fell, collapsing onto my knees, my head so close to the counter I almost smashed my muzzle against the marble.

I yelled, begging for the pain to stop cutting into my skin, releasing brutal screams of fear and agony as I tried to steady myself.

_This was officially my lowest of lows._

_I didn't know what to do._

_I could only cry and scream and plead for whoever was haunting my soul to just kill me._

I felt as though I was suffering a seizure. My body jerked, convulsed, and fought itself, wildly and uncontrollably. I crumpled down from my knees to my bottom, cradling into a ball, scraping my ankles as I clenched down hard on them.¬†

_This type of reaction... has only happened to me when I was smaller._

_I thought this part of me was gone, but... it still latched onto the corners of my psyche like a parasite._

_I felt the ground beneath me give away._¬†

_I fell through space, trying to grab ahold of anything that could bring me back to Earth before I was sucked into a black hole._

"CHARLIE!" Skyler gasped, tears running down his face as he hastily reached to help me off of the floor.

"WAIT! NO! NO!" I bawled mercilessly, scrambling away from Skyler after his attempt to hold me. "STOP! GET BACK!"

My hands slipped on the dampened tile floor, backing into the corner of the wall, slamming into it. I kicked the rug as I clambered away, scratching my claws into the wall, my head at the level of the toilet and the bathtub. The floor was gross and disgusting, but I kept closing myself off to get away from Skyler.

"Charlie!" He continued to cry, holding his hands out, yet not doing anything with them. He was so shaken that he couldn't move. He watched me break down with no clue of how to handle the situation.

"PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!" I screeched as if someone was hurting me terribly, destroying my throat and hiding my face behind my arms.

"WHAT?! CHARLIE, STOP!" Skyler kept crying.

"DAD! DAD! STOP! STOP, DAD!"

"CHARLIE, IT'S ME!"

"DAD! PLEASE! STOP!"  

"IT'S SKYLER! CHARLIE, PLEASE! YOU KNOW ME!"

"HELP! HELP!"

"CHARLIE!"

Skyler made the fateful decision and lunged forward, wrapping his arms around me.

  

I tried to fight back.¬†

But, for the first time, Skyler was stronger than me.

He held me in a sorrowful embrace, not allowing me to run free.

He trapped me within his arms, but... for once...

I felt at home.

  

_I knew these arms. I knew the way he felt._

_I knew who Skyler was._

  

I resisted the urge to keep fighting.

I gave in.

I immediately clasped onto him like my life depended on it.¬†

My face collided with his stomach. My arms seized around his waist.

I cried.

I cried even more, realizing how horrible things had become.

I cried because of how much suffering I've put myself and the people around me, the people that I love, through.

I cried because I spent most of my life hating what I had no control over.

I cried because Skyler was crying.

Skyler was holding me, in the corner of the bathroom, on the dirty floor, crying.

Holding me.

Skyler Clawfield.

  

We both laid there on the floor. My face was cradled deeply within Skyler's chest as he cloaked his arms around me.¬†

Skyler leaned against the wall as he caressed my head, moving his paw up and down my back, gently and with ease.

I wailed into his fur, allowing myself to be truly and fully open inside of his arms. My eyes were like a river, showering Skyler in my tears. I cried like there was no tomorrow.¬†

_I cried... and cried... and cried._

_And Skyler didn't care. He just held me as I cried._

_He held me... and held me... and held me._

"Talk to me, Charlie..." Skyler spoke in the quietest voice.

I tried to get ahold of my breathing. I was light-headed. My limbs felt like the buffering static from a TV that lost signal.

"Just tell me everything. Anything you want. I'm here. I'll always be here."

Skyler brushed his paw through the fur on my head, grounding me into his body.

Every stroke brought me back to reality. Every touch built the world back up again.

And the moment I felt I was back in control of my own body, I made the choice.

To talk.

"I miss my mom..." I sobbed, letting everything go. Letting it all out. "I miss her so much..." _The way I spoke didn't even sound comprehensible anymore. It was just a warped, diction-less sound. One that Skyler had somehow heard and understood._ "I just want her back! I just want my mom back!"  

"And that's okay, Charlie, that's okay‚Äî"

"I can't stand the fact that she's somewhere out there and I _never_ knew! For _fifteen years,_ I let her... I let her fucking _float around_ somewhere out there in the world without knowing! I didn't do _anything!_ I wasted so many years grieving when I could've been _with her!"_

"I know, Charlie, I know..." Skyler kept hugging me. He didn't loosen his grip one bit.

"I can't stand the fact that I did nothing...¬†_Nothing!_ I spent years doing _nothing!_ And she's been alive and walking the whole time! I can't stand to keep living without her... I can't _stand_ it anymore! I feel like dying. I feel like dying..."

"I hear you, Charlie. I'm listening. I'm here..."

"I don't want to hurt anymore... I just want to be happy! I want to be happy _with_ you and¬†_without_ the fear that I might hurt you someday..."

"You won't, Charlie..."

"They were in love... Once. My father _loved_ my mom! He _really_ loved her! He loved her _so fucking much,_ and... and that scares me so bad because... he loved her the same way I loved you, Skyler... He loved her until things changed... I can't stand to exist loving you when I know that someday I'll be the villain in your story... I'll become my father. Like I was always destined to. He loved my mom... And she loved him... They loved each other until they didn't."

"Charlie... Charlie..."

"I can't breathe... I can't breathe, Skyler..." I began to lift my head from his chest, holding onto the wall.

"Charlie, hey‚Äî"

"I can't breathe..! What's wrong with me?!"

"Nothing is wrong with you, Charlie, it's just a panic attack." Skyler touched his delicate paws to my cheeks, cooling my senses. He was a better refresher than the cold water.

"How do you know?"

"I've had plenty, Charlie. You've seen before."

"Fuck... Fuck, I hate it..." I grabbed onto the back of my head, looking into Skyler's eyes as if he could end all of my pain. "I feel like I can't breathe but I can but it feels like I can't..."

"Hey..." Skyler touched the sides of my torso.

"I don't want it, how do I stop it?!"

"Charlie, hey! Hey!"

"Fuck, how do I _stop it?!"_

"Hey, hey, _Charlie!"_¬†Skyler urged, gently pulling me into another hug, pressing my face up against his shoulder. He then directed it towards his, holding the sides of my head within his paws. "Listen to my voice... Hey..."¬†

Skyler stared deeply into my eyes.¬†

_The look of him... Skyler's beauty... was enough to calm every part of my body, inside and out._

"I know... I know... You're hurting..." Skyler kept brushing his fingers through my fur, tracing my ears and my skull. "You've gone through so much... I can't imagine how hard it is for you... But, you have to know that it's okay to feel this way. You can be vulnerable, Charlie. You don't have to hold things together _all_ the time _constantly_, it's _okay_ to be weak. You don't have to hide, okay?"

_Why..._

_Why did I waste so much of my life hiding?_

_I..._

  

The realization hit me.

_I've wasted so much of my life._

  

_In high school. At home._

_Even when I was a kid._

_My life._

_I wasted it by rejecting any love and attention that came my way._

_I wasted so much of it._

I began to cry again, so much more than ever before.

I bit my lip and shut my eyes, tears falling down my face from a neverending source.

"Come here..." Skyler moaned at the sight of my agony, leading me back into the embrace. "I'm so sorry, Charlie..."  

I cried quietly this time. I just grasped onto Skyler as he held me.

"I'm sorry about the restaurant."

"You couldn't have known."

"They were assholes to you."

"Yeah, they were. But I don't care about them. All I need is you."

Our positions mirrored the embrace we had this morning, but instead of _me_ holding Skyler from behind, it was _his_ turn to spoon me.

His arms were wrapped around, his chest against my back. My paws were clutched firmly onto his limbs that snaked around my torso. Skyler's chin rested on my shoulder. Our legs were sprawled out on the floor, entangled.

We sat there for a few minutes.

We couldn't move.

I don't think we wanted to anyway.

I sunk into Skyler's embrace, not wanting this moment to end.

I never want to let go of Skyler _ever_ again.

_I love him so much..._

_I... I love Skyler more than anything in the world._

_Anything._

  

Skyler reached for the buttons of my polo.

He began to undo some of them. One by one.

He pulled the placket of the polo apart, exposing my stomach and my chest. White fur all throughout.

He touched his whole hand against my stomach, making sure I could feel him against my bare fur.

Skyler began to trace circles around my belly button.

Slowly, my tears, ever so carefully, reached the end of their reign. They whisked away from my eyes like dew in the fresh morning wind.

_I felt okay again._

_I felt okay._

  

"I have an idea," Skyler whispered into my ear.  

"What is it..?"

"Come with me," Skyler spoke. "I want to try something with you."

\~~~

Following Sky's instructions, we changed out of our fancy attire and put on old clothing that we could make a mess in. _I didn't know he was referring to paint at first, but it turns out, we were going to do some art._ I confusingly switched out of my tux into a white t-shirt and gray sweatpants.¬†

For about ten minutes or so, I stood¬†unsurely in the corner of Skyler's art studio, watching as he began to set up some sort of space for us to work. He laid down a wide, blue tarp on the floor and draped the northern wall with a long sheet of some sort of plastic covering, possibly to keep paint or other substances from dirtying the surfaces. He then acquired his easel and planted it on the tarp, facing it away from the covered wall. It was almost too heavy for him, and when I tried to offer help, he declined. He was setting this all up for me.

Skyler then pulled out six thick, heavy-duty buckets of paint from a duffel bag in the corner with all of his other equipment, positioning them in a straight line in front of the easel on the tarp. Using a screwdriver, he popped off the lids, revealing the many pigments of color that we'd be working with: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and pink. A basic, everyday palette (excluding purple oddly enough), but Skyler ensured that it didn't matter what colors we chose. The outcome would make up for it. I still didn't know what we were doing.

Lastly, Skyler grabbed a sheet of acyclic canvas paper and, using a pencil, made a quick sketch. He was faced away from me at that time, purposefully, so I couldn't exactly see what he was drawing. He then took out scissors and began to cut into the sheet of paper, removing a certain shape. I couldn't discern what shape, since he'd hid it behind his body, but I know that he made some sort of tracing or outline and was cutting out the inside of it, wanting only the borders of the silhouette. Finally, he pasted it to the painting canvas on the easel with masking tape and joined my side. I _still_ couldn't see what it was because the white paper matched the shade of the canvas, camouflaging from my sight.

"So... Remember when I told you that my mom would make me do this thing called, 'Art Therapy'?" Skyler reflected, resting his paw on my shoulder. I nodded my head, still a little unsure of what was happening. "We're gonna do that."

Skyler patted me on the back and stepped forward, approaching the paint buckets on the floor. "All these different colors represent different aspects of your emotions and, well, your mind. Your personality."

He made his way over to the left-most can and moved down the line. "Red can be your anger. The things that just... piss you off. Orange can be the things that scare you. Yellow can be what makes you happy, green can represent your interests and goals. Blue, of course, can be what makes you sad. And finally, pink can be the things that you have a love for."

"Do you know what a splatter painting is?" Skyler then quickly dashed over to the desk by the side of the room and obtained a mostly clean paintbrush from a cup. He then came over and placed it in my hands, wrapping his own around the paw that held the brush. The handle was stained with old, dry acrylic markings from past art sessions. There was a history to it.

"Uh... A painting made with splatters?"

"Yeah." Skyler held back onto my shoulder again, pointing with his finger to direct my attention over to the pails and the easel in front of us. "So, you're gonna dip that brush in every color and just... go crazy."

I looked down at the paintbrush. _It was only one. But it held so much potential._¬†

"...You mean it?"

"It's your painting, not mine. The goal is... you're trying to create a self-portrait, one that you feel represents yourself the best, with the colors I gave you." Skyler took another look at the array of paint buckets. "To be honest, I probably would've used a more unique color scheme, but this is your first beginner's painting, so we're going with basic rainbow."

"...How do I do it?"

"It's not my place to tell you how to do it. Art doesn't have rules, that's one of the many reasons I fell in love with it. Every style, every technique, look, fashion, appearance; it's all different. But, it's all accepted. And it's all art."

"Like photography."

"Or people."

I turned my head over to Sky.

"...Where do I start?"

"Remember what I always say. Start a line and let your heart take it wherever it wants to go. Well, in this case, start a _splatter_, but you know what I mean," Skyler chuckled, making me do the same in return.

"Okay..." I mumbled with a smile on my face, nervously approaching the paint.¬†

_I didn't know why I was acting like I was afraid of it. It's just paint._

"Do whatever you want, Charlie. Feel free to experiment with _anything_. Have fun! Get messy! Art knows no bounds!" Skyler expressed words of encouragement, shouting them from down the hallway as he left the room.

I stared at the blank canvas for a few seconds, thinking about how I could start this 'painting'.

Skyler returned with two items, a cup of water that he'd just got from the bathroom sink for me to dip and clean the brush in, and his phone. After setting the cup down next to the paint buckets on the floor, he tapped on his phone and opened his music app. He then resumed his playlist and set it on the desk, filling the room with calm tunes. Apparently, it was for me to enter a certain headspace. _Art therapy, as his mother would call it._

Looking back at the easel, I thought it over.

_What color could I start with? I guess something that represents the base of my personality since it'll be the foundation of the whole painting..?_

_I don't know, I'm trying so hard to think metaphorically about this. Skyler knows more about interpretive art than I do._

_Maybe I'll just take what I know about photography and use it here._

_Photography is a main interest of mine, so I guess I could start with green. Green is also the most common color to be seen in photographs, whether landscape or portrait._

I focused on the green paint bucket and dipped the brush in. I pulled it out, the bristles oozing with a sage pigmentation.¬†

As I approached the easel, the paint began to drip all over the floor. I winced, growing insecure about where I was stepping.

"The floor's protected by the tarp, Charlie, don't worry!" Skyler giggled, leaning up against the wall and crossing his arms, watching me work. "It's okay if you make a mess. That's the whole point."

I nodded my head and finally reached the easel. I held the paintbrush up, ready to 'make a mess'.

Skyler had said something below his breath.

I could only interpret it as, _"Just go for it"._

After a quick breather, I swiped the paintbrush through the air, not touching the blank canvas. But, what _did_ touch the canvas were several drops of flying green paint, making a bigger splash against the easel than I had intended. The green had left a cluttered streak in a chaotic fashion on the cotton, my first ever brush stroke made. The paint also got on the plastic-covered wall behind the easel, but as Sky had said, it's okay to make a mess.

I took another swing, making more impressions on the canvas. After that, another swing. And another. And a few more, until it looked like it had enough green.

"There we go," Skyler clapped with a bright smile. I couldn't help but smile as well. _Literally, a toddler could do this, but that wasn't the point. It wasn't to make it look like good, professional art, it was to visualize the internal aspects of my mind. At least, that's what I thought I was doing. Again, Skyler knows this stuff better than I do._

I washed off the brush in the water and went for another color. This time, I went for orange. As I began to add the new color to the canvas, I thought about what _really_ scared me.

_My father. Losing my friends, Jonathan, Claire, Becca... Losing Skyler._

_Losing everything because of my own selfish actions._

I splattered the painting with orange with those thoughts held firmly in my head. Oddly enough, the markings had made different shapes when I'd thought about what I was afraid of. Different patterns.

With those same feelings, I washed the brush and started again with blue.

Things that made me sad.

_Expectations._

_Failing to live up to those expectations._

_Not being able to provide for the people I love._

_Losing the people I love._

_Trying desperately to keep them from leaving that, in turn, I scare them._

_Scaring Skyler._¬†

_Making Skyler upset._

I felt my eyes water once again when I threw the blue all over the canvas.¬†

The blue juxtaposed to the green and orange wasn't exactly looking very organized.

_I guess the insecurities were beginning to get to my perfectionist head._

"Hey, need any help?" Skyler offered, joining my side. He could detect when I was acting differently.

"It looks a little weird," I told him. "I know it's not supposed to look perfect, but the paint doesn't feel like it's... I don't know, 'reaching' enough?"

"Here, try this," Skyler spoke, taking the paintbrush from my hand. He then, unexpectedly, _full-on,_ placed his hand on the bristles coated in blue paint.

He pulled back the bristles and let them fly. Like shooting a thousand mini slingshots at once, tiny drops of paint projected all over the canvas in a way that was more spread-out and took up more negative space.  

"You can just... put your hand in the paint?" I asked, wondering why Skyler wasn't affected by the wet acrylics staining his paw and fur.

"Yeah, like I said, get messy!"

Skyler then raised his paw towards my face, and with a gentle flick of his fingers, splattered a small amount of blue on my face. I flinched, closing my eyes. "Ah‚Äî!"

Skyler gasped, breaking into a burst of small wheezing laughter. "I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to get so much on your face‚Äî!"

I touched my snout and cheeks, feeling the paste all over my pure white fur. I scoffed and nodded my head, biting my lip, trying not to laugh. I couldn't see the mess he made, but it was enough to make me raring for revenge. "Alright, bitch, let's go."

I grabbed the brush out of his hand and ran over to one of the buckets, dipping it into whatever color was in front of me. I accidentally didn't wash the brush, so unfortunately the blue had mixed with the yellow, but it wouldn't have mattered. "Charlie, wait!" Skyler began to laugh with suppressed fear.

I stood up, holding my brush over my head like a weapon, threatening Skyler.

"No, NO! Charlie!" Skyler squealed, throwing his arms up to block his face, walking backward. He almost collided into the easel, but he was careful enough to know where it was.

With one fell swoop, I splattered yellow paint all over him.¬†

He laughed out loud, drenched in the bright color, squeaking with excitement. He raced forward, trying to get the brush back, but of course, I held it up high where he couldn't reach it. Every jump Skyler made caused me to hold it up higher.

After he'd had enough with me, he began to 'playfully' punch me. _I say that like he could even fight in real life._

I looked over at the painting, noticing that some of the yellow had gotten on the canvas.

Skyler and I, fighting over the brush, shook it near the painting, more yellow splatters coating the easel.¬†

_It was funny how I had accidentally used the happy-related color when I was actually feeling happy. And what was even more coincidental was that I had gotten the yellow paint all over Skyler. He was definitely a thing that made me happy._

Skyler then dragged his paw against the paint on his chest, coating it in the yellow substance and slathering it all over my face.

"Oh, fuck you!" I gleefully groaned, trying to get it back on him, but as small as he was, he was pretty damn quick and agile. It was almost impossible to catch him. I eventually gave up trying to chase a cat and moved on to a different color.

I picked red.

The big one. The things that angered me.

"I think I'm gonna need a larger brush for this one," I snorted, looking down into the metal can.

"Who said you needed a brush?" Skyler remarked, joining my side by the can.¬†

He leaned down and, instead of using the paintbrush, shoved his _entire hand_ into the paint.

_Both hands._

"Oh, shit, are you serious?" My jaw dropped as Skyler pulled his hands out, _soaking_ in that thick, red liquid, pouring down from his paws like molasses.¬†

"Please, I've done this several times. Now, you do it."

"It's gonna stain! My fur isn't as vibrant as yours, it takes forever to get paint out!" I whined.

"We'll take long, excruciating showers after this, believe me."

"...You know what? I'll do it. As long as you take a shower _with_ me."

"Shut up, Charlie. Just do it."

"Fine."

With some hesitation, I suffocated my own paws into the paint, the texture of the liquid feeling clammy and heavy, but fulfilling. I had tossed away any insecurity I had and was now living freely. Thanks to Skyler. And his paint.

"Ready?" Skyler said as I removed my paws from the solution.

"Let's do it."

In an instant, we both spun around and, rapid-fire, flailed our limbs around in the intended direction of the painting. We fuckin'¬†_sprayed_ that red paint all over the canvas. And the walls. And the floor.¬†

Of course, we took the chance to throw more paint at one another, completely wrecking ourselves in the process. The floor had gotten slippery with all the colorant, causing me to slip and fall a few times while trying to capture him.

It was funny. While using the red, I was reminded of all the things that made me angry, but... _I didn't even feel upset. Not anymore._

_I thought about all of it. Everything single thing that used to light a raging, heated fire inside my soul._

_My father._

_My father lying._

_My father's abuse towards my mother. Towards me._

_The way he used to beat and assault me when I was only a little kid._

_The way it traumatized me for life._

_The way anything remotely related to abuse began to remind me of him._

_Every time I saw someone unhappy, it reminded me of him. And what was done to me._

_Every time I saw Skyler afraid or sad or a complete, broken down mess..._

_It would always remind me of how broken Hugo had left me._

_And I would strive to make sure that no one else felt the same abuse that I did._

_I promised myself that I wouldn't let anyone else suffer the pain I suffered._

  

_I thought about it all and yet, I wasn't angry in the slightest._

_In fact, I was suddenly relieved._

_I had figured it out, almost._

  

_Maybe it's because of the trauma._

_Maybe that's why I try so hard to protect the ones I love._¬†

_Maybe that's why I'm so blinded by my own negative ego. Because I try so hard to help others... that I don't even help myself._

_Because all I really was... growing up... was someone who didn't have any love._

_And someone who didn't deserve any._

_Most of it was due to my father's abuse, but..._

_Another part of it could be because of the way my mother abandoned me._

_As I aged, I continued to believe that it was still true. That I didn't deserve love._

_Because the two people I wanted love from..._¬†

_The two singular people... My mother and my father..._

_...didn't get the chance to give any of it to me._

  

_Fuck... this art therapy shit really does work..._

  

"Hey, you okay?" Skyler touched my shoulder gently. I had been staring at the painting with all the red markings for too long.

I looked down at Skyler.

He gazed into my eyes with an innocent curiosity.

There was this beauty to Skyler Clawfield. One I couldn't describe.

But, every day, _every day_, for possibly the _rest_ of my entire _dumbass fucking_ _life_... I fall in love with him. All over again.

There's not a day I don't fall in love with him again.

Every morning, I wake up to his face and fall in love.

Even the little things, like seeing him brush his teeth in the bathroom... or painting... or reading a book... or even fucking sleeping... _makes me fall in love with him so hard._

"Yeah, Skyler," I spoke. "I'm okay."

"One last color to go."

"Pink. The things I love."

"How are you going to use it?"

"...Can we just pick up the entire bucket and throw it over the canvas?" I snorted, feeling happier than ever. "I think, after everything, love empowers every single aspect of my personality. My soul."

"That's beautiful, Charlie."

"You're beautiful, Skyler."

"...Thank you, Charlie."

"You're welcome, Skyler."

  

We both walked over to the final can of paint. We each grabbed one side and lifted the heavy load with minimal struggle.

The two of us tugged it over, standing with our feet planted firmly on the floor, approaching the painting.

"On three," I said.

"On three," Skyler repeated.

Our hands stiffened against the metal.

We prepared for the final touch.

The two of us counted in unison.

"One... two... three!"

With one fatal swing, the pink paint flew from the bucket and rained down on the canvas.

  

In the aftermath of the storm, the painting was now a colorful collage of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and a _whole_ lot of pink.

The colors began to swirl and sway almost, like a pool of mystic waters. Or an ocean.

"Alright, you ready for the final step?" Skyler asked.

"...We're _still_ not done?"

With another small laugh, Skyler stepped forward and put his rainbow-stained hands on the edges of the canvas. He began to scratch at the edges, peeling away the masking tape and eventually removing that one sheet of canvas paper that he had pasted to the painting, which was caked in paint.¬†

As he took it off, a figure had shown through. The outline was initially added so that the splattered paint could stay contained in one space and not go any further, differentiating the areas of the canvas that were painted and not painted.¬†

There needed to be just plain white space. In order for the figure to be obvious.

He had done it for a purpose.¬†

The figure... was me.

It was really only a shape, but I could tell it was me. I saw my tall, floppy, pointy ears and long, blocky snout. I could see the ruffles of my fur and the collar of my polo shirt.

But, instead of it being an actual sketch of me, in place of my silhouette was our splatter painting. It filled in the entire profile, representing all the emotions that built up my body, and me, as a whole.

I didn't even know how to show my amazement.

I just stood there, frozen, staring at the self-portrait.

"Well... There you go, Charlie. You made art."

"...I did?"

"Yeah. You did."

I turned my head back over to Skyler, who was still coated head-to-toe in various colors of paint.

"But... it's just a bunch of random splatters."

"...Aren't we all? Trust me when I tell you this, but... _every_ _single_ _person_ is a mess inside. But aren't crazy messes the beauty of art? Aren't we all just art after all? Painted and made to attract? Connect? Feel?"

Skyler looked back over at our creation. He slowly paced closer to it.

"Isn't life just... one big painting? Everything, in the end, is art. And art is beautiful, Charlie. It really is. All the things that make you who you are, whether good or bad, is beautiful. Because it makes you alive." Skyler turned back around. He then made his way back over to me, looking up into my eyes. "And I love who you are, Charlie. I wouldn't have you any differently."

As much as I didn't want to, I started to cry again.

_I hadn't cried like this in so long._

_But, this time, it felt right._

_It felt good._

"I love you, too, Skyler."

  

My kitten boyfriend then reached up, standing firmly on top of his tippy-toes. He latched his paint-covered arms around my shoulders and brought his mouth close to mine, millimeters apart.

"Thank you for talking to me," Skyler whispered.

"Thank you for listening."

  

My grip tightened around him.

In no way was I letting go of Skyler tonight.

_Don't lose him, Charlie._

_Don't lose him._

We kissed.

  

Sure, we slipped on the paint again and collapsed onto the floor, but we didn't care.

Skyler climbed on top of me and continued to kiss me.

I kissed him back, locking him into an embrace that I never wanted to loosen.

We just kept kissing.¬†

And laughing.

But, most importantly, crying.

  

_Luckily, they were happy tears._

# 33. THE WATER'S FINE

\~~~

## Skyler

"And then she was just gone, out of sight. I tried to call and text her, but she didn't answer her phone. And she hasn't, ever since she drove off. It's been two days, Sky, and I haven't been able to reach her. Jonathan and I, we're worried."

I stared into Claire's sullen, remorseful eyes. The poor fox was a nervous wreck, sitting there on the couch, hunched over and timidly fidgeting with her own paws. The bags under her eyes and the shaking of her limbs revealed that in those two days that had passed, she hadn't gotten any sleep.

"Claire," I spoke, comfortingly as I reached forward, across the couch, resting my paw on her's. "It's Becca. There's no way she would just leave. She's going to come back, she has to."

"How do you know that?" She stressed.

"She's probably just having a moment, Claire. Maybe, it's important that we give her space to figure things out."

"But you don't know her like I do! I went to high school with her, I know what she's capable of!"

"What do you mean, Claire?"

"You... You know what I mean, Sky," Claire didn't want to admit it. "You saw her, that one time. You caught her and you stopped her from... doing those things to herself. Don't you understand?"

"Yes, she had an... eating disorder, but, what does that mean for‚Äî"  

"It means that she's not afraid to hurt herself!" Claire whimpered, holding her paws out pleadingly. "With Becca, it's... It's dangerous for her when she doubts herself."

"Claire. I'm as worried as you are." I leaned in further. "But, we'll find her, okay? We'll get her back." I looked down at the couch cushion below me. "Trust me, we've _both_ had a rough couple of days."

Claire rubbed her eyes. "...I'm sorry I suddenly dropped all of this on you."

"It's okay, Claire. I mean, you invited me over to your place today to 'talk', so, honestly, I was prepared for heavy baggage to be unloaded... considering everything happening recently."

Claire lowered her voice and her tone. "...How are you holding up? Anything going on with you and Charlie?"

"...It's not important at this moment. It's solved, as for now."

"What happened? You want to talk about it?"

I gently shook my head. "I'd love to, but, I think it's better if it stays between me and Charlie."

Claire touched my leg sympathetically. "Are you okay?"

"I've been fine." _I wasn't lying this time._

"Is Charlie okay?"

"He's... getting there," I nodded my head.¬†

_I wasn't lying this time either._

_Charlie... is doing better._

_He's been learning how to_¬†_be kinder to his own mental health and how to_¬†_put less pressure on himself. He's taken the day off to rest up and relax, which he desperately needed. The poor husky has been through so much lately._

_Charlie and I; we've planned to go to therapy together. It was my suggestion, and I really thought the both of us needed it. Charlie's never gone before, so he's a little nervous, but I assured him that it'll be alright. I'll be by his side, no matter what, even if it doesn't work out. For better or for worse, we'll always have each other._

_I also suggested that he should go on medication, considering that I sensed a bit of BPD in him. I had it as well, so I knew the signs. Charlie said he had to think about it._

_I understood. He needed time. He still has to figure out what he's going to do with the case of his vanished mother and apologetic father. He still examines those letters over and over again as if he were missing something; some clue, some hint, that could point him in the right direction._

"How about Jonathan?" I questioned Claire, changing the subject.

"Well, after we made up, the whole Becca-running-away thing happened, so we've both been, sorta, on edge. But, as you said about Charlie, we're... getting there."

"Well, I guess, getting there is better than _not_ being there at all."

The edges of Claire's mouth rose only slightly, seemingly cheered up a little. "...How's the drawing going?"

I looked down at the Surface Pro sketchpad that sat on my lap, displaying the current commission that I was working on. "Oh, I already finished."

"That fast?"

"Well, we've been talking ever since 4 PM when I started the commission, and now‚Äî" I stared outside of the window of Jonathan and Claire's living room, "‚Äîthe sun is setting. So, it wasn't necessarily that fast."

"I'm sorry I kept you for so long."

"Hey, it's my job as a friend to be here for you."

"Shouldn't you be getting back to Charlie?"

"Yeah... now that you mention it, I should go." I checked the time on my phone and immediately sat up from the living room couch, shutting off the tablet and packing it back into my purse.

"Nothing like a little girl-talk to make things a little better, you know?" Claire joked, attempting to lighten the mood, standing up as I had done. "Thank you so much for coming, Skyler."

"You know I'm always here for you. Just one phone call away." I reached forward with open arms, pulling Claire into a hug. "We'll find her, okay?" I whispered into her ear as I squeezed her. "We just need to be patient. She'll come back to us, eventually. I know she will."

"Sky..? Have you talked to Charlie yet about... you?"

I pulled away from the hug and stared back into her eyes. There was no fooling her, and there was no point in lying.¬†

"I'm guessing you haven't, judging by the fact that you aren't wearing any of the clothes we bought you at the mall," Claire observed, looking down at my neutral, classic black clothing.

I hesitated and sighed. "I'm waiting for the right time."

"Now seems perfect."

"Charlie's been handling with a lot right now. I want us to be in a good place before I drop this... _bomb_ on him."

"It's your choice, Skyler. But, the sooner you tell him, the better. You don't want to keep secrets from him, right?"

"It's not a secret, I'm... just trying to keep things from falling apart. I'm just trying... to protect him..." _Those last three words, as I said them, fell apart like a fragile tower of cards._

"You alright?"

"Yeah, I..."¬†  

_I guess I can understand now why Charlie believed he was right to keep things from me, even if it wasn't right at all._

"...Yeah. I'm fine." I scratched the back of my head as I collected my thoughts together. "God... what am I going to tell my parents? And Cal?" I whined, rubbing my temples with stress. "I can't believe I haven't thought about their opinions until now..."

_I haven't talked to them in a while. I had just realized that._

"You've come out to your family once before, you can do it again," Claire encouraged me. "Remember, it's _your_ parents, Sky. There's no way they _won't_ accept you. You're _really_ lucky to have family members that aren't homophobic... or strict... or heavily expectant of you."

_She's right. Others aren't as lucky as I am._

"Yeah, you're right... Thank you, Claire." I hugged the fox one more time before heading to the front door of their house. "...I'll see you soon, okay? Call me when you need me, I'm always here."

"I'm always here, too, if you need me." Claire smiled. "Also, one more thing before you go, why do your arms look slightly red?"

"Oh, I was painting last night."

\~~~

Getting home later at night was unusual for me. Normally, Charlie was the one to return late while I stayed home all day, but since he had taken a mental health day, the roles had been reversed.

I chained my bike to our fence and drudged up the front steps, exhausted from biking all the way from Claire's place to here. I just wanted to get back to my boyfriend.¬†

The house seemed dark from the inside, which was strange. _Was Charlie even home?_

I pulled out my keys anyway and fit them inside of the lock.

Opening the door, I found it to be pitch black inside the house.

"Charlie?" I called out, reaching for the light switch on the wall. "I'm home!"

After flicking on the lights, I took my purse off and placed it on the table beside the front door. I was about to head for our bedroom in search of Charlie, but something had stopped me. I felt something littered beneath my shoe.

  

Looking down at the floor, I saw rose petals.

Rose petals sprinkled over the ground in a line too straight and narrow to be done on accident.

A line that pursued all the way to the door that led to the hallway, which led to the bedroom.

_A setup._

"Oh, God..." I whispered to myself, brushing my paw through the fur on my head.

_...Charlie, what have you done this time?_

After taking a deep sigh, I kicked off my shoes and stared down at the red trail. "Charlie, what is this?" I called out, obtaining no answer.

I rolled my eyes and reluctantly meandered along the path, following the rose petals to wherever they were leading me. Wherever Charlie wanted me to go.

The rose petal trail traced from the front door, to the hallway, all the way down to the bedroom as I had guessed.

I rubbed my temples as I slowly approached the door. _Jesus Christ..._

Opening it, I fully expected the petals to lead over to the bed, where I imagined Charlie would be laying, most likely naked, with even more rose petals sprinkled all over the mattress. I even pictured a basket with two bottles of wine and a fake swan made out of towels to be placed on the bedside table, but instead, the petals lead elsewhere.

Into the bathroom.

Before I even entered, I could see the orange, glowing reflection of candles, gleaming along the polished wooden doorframe. I knew what I would find when I went inside.

"Goddammit, Charlie..." I muttered to myself.

_I guess this is how he spent his day off._

  

As I walked inside, I found Charlie.

Sitting in a bubble bath.¬†

Surrounded by candles and rose petals.

Naked.

The water was tinged white with soap, so I couldn't actually see anything below the chest, but he was still naked. In front of me.

"Welcome home," he said amorously, leaning against the rim of the tub, his arms resting on the edges suavely.¬†

I looked at him, up and down.

I felt my cheeks burn as my entire face went red.

The opaque water submerged his body all the way up to his chest. The bare, white fur above the waterline was dry as if he had just gotten in. He must've been waiting for me to come home in order to jump in.

The mood in the room was heated, in more ways than one. There was steam coming off of the hot water and candles, making the scenery displayed before me very explicit-looking. It was so clich√© that I could swear I could hear jazz music playing on a radio somewhere in the distance.

I took a deep breath in through my nostrils and rocked my head all the way back, staring up at the ceiling as I released the breath.

"Charlie, I swear to God..."

"Hey‚ÄîSky, just hear me out‚Äî" Charlie sat up from the rim, immediately switching over to his usual, eager, goofball personality.¬†

"You know I'm not getting in there with you."

"Okay, okay, look," he slid his body closer to the edge of the tub in order to speak to me formally. "You told me before you felt like you were boring me because you were unable to have sex. Again, you _aren't,_ but I thought that... maybe we could... _spice_ things up a little in a non-sexual way? To, sort of, ease into it..? We don't have to do anything that's not to your liking, okay?"

"You... want me to take a bath with you?"

"C'mon, you gotta admit, it's a little romantic..." Charlie mumbled, slouching as he scanned his surroundings. He had decorated the bathroom just for me.

"Yeah, in telenovelas and TV shows. This is real life."

"Skyler, you know I love you..." Charlie began, leaning in closer. "But, I find it absurd that we've been dating for _four years_ and I've never even seen you without your _shirt_ _or_ _pants_ on. Maybe this can be the time."

_He can't be serious, there's no way I'd..._

  

Staring at the bathtub, I realized how nice it would actually be.¬†

To feel comfortable enough to do this with him.

"Besides, I stuck my arms into that can of paint yesterday and it _still_ hasn't come out of my fur, so it's time for you to uphold _your_ end of the bargain!" Charlie joked.

_I know that, normally, I would despise this sort of thing._

_And I honestly thought that would be my reaction to this, but..._

_I didn't cower away._

_The water... did... look inviting._¬†

_And not just because Charlie was in it._¬†

_I've been waiting for a break or... some sort of relief for so long. A warm bath with the person I love most sounded like the perfect way to cool off._¬†

"Charlie, I..." I attempted to fathom words, but my mind was now all over the place. _Do I accept his offer, or..?_ "...I want to, really, but..."

_Oh, God, oh, God... What is happening to me?_

_My palms are becoming sweaty and I'm stumbling over my words... I can't think straight..._

_Maybe it's because my boyfriend is literally inviting me to get naked with him and join him in taking a bath. A fucking bath! When was taking baths a romantic thing? What is it about soap, water, and scrubbing that makes things 'spicier'?! Would I even be able to do this with him? Am I capable, or would I freak out again like I always do? Fuck!_

_Oh, Jesus, I'm losing my mind right now..._

_Why am I faltering?_¬†_Do I want to do this or not?_

_One side of me is saying that I shouldn't, considering that physical sexuality is something I've always been afraid of, but... another part of me craved the idea._

_Again, Charlie did say it was non-sexual. At least, I hoped it would be._

Charlie noticed how deeply conflicted I was. I hadn't said a real word in, like, a full minute.

His expression shifted from eagerness to disheartened. He looked down at the water in which the husky sat in, his reflection staring back at him.

"Sky, it's okay if you don't want to," Charlie then spoke, dismissing the idea. "I probably should've given you a warning or something."

"No, Charlie, it's fi‚Äî"

"It was a stupid idea anyway, don't worry," he laughed it off, turning around in the tub and reaching for one of the many candles on the surfaces of the bathtub edges. He held it up to his muzzle and blew out the flame. "We can do something else if you'd like?"

"I want to do it."

  

Charlie then looked up at me, a little stunned.

"I... I want to try, at least," I admitted, blushing as I squeezed my eyelids shut. It was silent for a few seconds, so I opened one eye to peek at Charlie, who was re-lighting the candle with the flame of another.

"Sky, are you sure?" Charlie reassured, wanting me to feel as safe as I possibly could.

"I'll only do this... if you agree to stop when I say I want to stop."

"Basic principles of a relationship, Sky." Charlie reached his hand out for me. I carefully approached the bathtub and took his soaked paw in mine, leaning down to his level in the tub. "I'm only going to do what you're okay with. I promise that. And if I _want_ to do something, I'll ask for permission first. I'm gonna keep you safe, alright?"

"Alright," I nodded, trusting his means.

"You're gonna be fine. Plus, I literally bought a bath bomb at Walmart for this, so the water's one-hundred-percent not-clear. I couldn't see anything, even if I tried."

"Where'd you even get the rose petals and the candles?"

"I did a lot of shopping today."

_He really did all of this just for me._

"...Charlie..." I furrowed my brows, suddenly growing sentimental. _I wanted him to know how happy I was to have someone like him; someone that treated me like a real person with rights to love and attention._ "Thank you... for respecting my boundaries when we first started dating," I smiled apologetically, fondling his paw tenderly. "I'm sorry I held you back all those years. I really appreciated it, though. You never got impatient, you waited on me, and I love you for that. I promise you, one day, it'll pay off."

"However long it takes for you to feel comfortable with it," Charlie smiled back. "If I have to wait four more years, I don't care. I'll wait ten. Twenty. Because my life with you is as exciting, endearing, and beautiful as it possibly could be. Even without the sex part."

_There he is._¬†

_That's my Charlie._

_The one I fell in love with all those years ago._

_He's been hiding away for too long. I'm glad he's back._

I smiled iridescently, tapping my fingers against the porcelain of the bathtub.

"Um... can you look away?" I winced, hoping it wouldn't annoy him. "Just while I'm getting undressed?"

"Yes, yes, of course."

Charlie then clasped his paws over his eyes comically, splashing a bit of water on his face in the process. He turned his whole body around, facing the wall that the bathtub was up against. I tittered a little at his obedience, but the smile quickly left my face when I thought about getting naked.

_I mean, I wanted to do it._¬†

_Like, I actually, really did want this._

_I don't understand why it feels so off, though. I know I've been dreading these types of moments with Charlie ever since I met him, but now that it's actually something I'm open to, it feels so unlike me._

_But, then again, I have been figuring more things out about myself and my body recently. I've grown more comfortable, and with that comfort, I've become more open. To a spectrum of things. Things with Charlie._

As he hid away from me, I took a few steps backward.

Realizing that Charlie was now waiting for me, I immediately reached for the buttons of my flannel, undoing them hastily. One by one.

I began to unclothe myself, apprehensively, yet, rather quickly as if some ardent compulsion was fueling my actions; a compulsion that I didn't want to think about. I just let it take control as I removed my t-shirt from underneath the flannel, now exposing my bare torso.

I stopped. I felt colder without the clothing on my chest. I felt more vulnerable and susceptible... more helpless and visible like this. I've always hated feeling that way, which is why I never took off my clothes in front of anyone, but this time... _I wanted Charlie to see me like this. Vulnerable, susceptible, helpless, visible._

_I wanted him to see me like this so he could... take control._¬†

_So I could fall under his romantic spell and let him... command me._¬†

_I want to be his._

  

_This is so fucking weird._

_Why do I suddenly have all these ideas ensuing inside of my head? Of what he could... do to me..?_

I felt my head turn slowly towards the right wall, where the bathroom mirror stood prominently. After catching only a glimpse of my shirtless appearance, I jerked my head away.

_Don't look at the mirror, Sky._

_This is one of the few times where you feel beautiful enough to be open like this, don't sabotage it._¬†

_Just believe that you are beautiful, and in return, Charlie will see that beauty._

_The world will._

  

I grabbed the button of my jeans and undid it.

I squeezed my eyes shut, feeling an awkward tension arise as I grabbed the waistband of my jeans, ready to pull my pants off.

_Just take them off, Sky, no big deal..._

With laser-fast instincts, I stripped down to my underwear, and without a second thought, I took them off, too. I took advantage of the adrenaline rush before I had any chance to regret it.

I won't hold myself back this time. I know what I want and I'm going to take it.

_Okay, okay, okay..!_

Once I had been fully unclothed, I hurried over to the bath, wanting to jump in instantly. I hated being naked. Charlie, still, was not looking. Thankfully.

_You won't regret this, Sky._

_Just get in... You'll love it..._

  

With no hesitation, I crossed my bare legs over the edge of the tub and immediately dipped into the water, submerging my whole body into the warm, soapy liquid. I had done it a little too quickly, as the water had splashed a minor amount, causing Charlie to turn around, yet, his eyes were still closed.

I stayed as far away from his body as possible, but the tub was so tiny and sleek that our feet were forcefully touching together. We were on opposite sides but in the same bath.

"I guess you got in," Charlie assumed, his eyes still shut.¬†

"...Y-Yeah..." I stammered, still bewildered by the fact that I was actually capable of doing this.

"...Can I open my eyes yet?"

"Uh..." I paused, looking down at my body, which was only halfway underwater. My entire torso was showing, causing me to feel self-conscious.¬†

Swiftly, I sunk lower into the nontransparent water in order to hide more of my body, the waterline rising up to my neck when I'd stopped. Our feet were still intertwining under the water. "...Okay, um... You can look."

Charlie slowly and surely lifted his eyelids. He set his sights down on me, hiding amongst the bubbles in the milk-like water.¬†

A mix of emotions could be determined from his facial expressions.¬†

He seemed happy; Happy that I had chosen to do this with him‚ÄîHe seemed impressed; Impressed that I had worked up the courage to strip down and join him in the water‚ÄîHe also seemed amused; Amused by how, literally, only my head could be seen from his perspective‚Äîbut lastly, he seemed really, really gratified. I had finally been able to take a step into furthering our relationship. Even if this wasn't inherently sexual, it was intimate. Another level of intimate.

"Hey, Sky."

"Hi, Charlie."

I felt the tension heat up between us.¬†

Charlie seemed so calm and relaxed. I was having a whole screaming fit in my head.

He chuckled and reached for a bottle of soap or whatever shower product we used‚Äîshampoo, conditioner, I don't fucking know‚Äîand snapped open the cap. He turned the bottle upside down and squirted some of the soap onto his paw, rubbing his hands together.

He then reached out to me.

I could tell he wanted me to come closer.

  

_So I did._

Just like that, I sat up out of the water and scooted closer towards him in the tub like I was carrying out a programmed directive; no hesitation or anything. I just did it like we'd done this a million times before.

I had shown my body to him.¬†

My torso was revealed as I rose out of the water to get closer, raw and unsheltered.¬†

_And I wasn't afraid._¬†

This was Charlie's first time seeing the bare, soaked, blue-and-pink-striped fur on my torso that hid behind a shirt every day. The colors and stripes looked the same as the design on my arms and face, but Charlie stared at my body as if he was seeing brand new patterns. I don't think he ever knew that I had a white patch of fur running from my chest to my stomach.

I had never been _this_ exposed in front of Charlie before.¬†

_But I liked it. For the first time, I really liked it._

Charlie, gently and with tender care, grabbed my arms and pulled me in. He then began to scrub the soap onto my arms, brushing his fingers through my damp fur. He soaped me down and bathed me like a guardian treating a baby.¬†

It felt so, _so_ nice. To be caressed and touched in this way.

I never expected to enjoy this as much as I did.

He moved his hands towards my shoulders.

"How was your day?" He asked quietly as he continued to scrub my fur.

_How can he just start up a normal conversation in a moment like this?_¬†

_He's something else, I swear to God, he's..._

  

_Christ, don't get a nosebleed, Skyler._

"I-It... It was fine," I stuttered, swallowing my saliva and trying not to drool.¬†_Charlie was starting to make me feel so many feelings that I've never felt before. I didn't want to make it obvious, but my whole body was starting to squirm with elation._ "H-How was yours?"

"It was nice," Charlie said, moving his hand down from my shoulders to my chest. I felt tingles run around every surface of my body as he touched me in those areas, his fingers brushing against tiny, sensitive spots. The blood began to rush through my veins as my heartbeat grew faster. "It's been a while since I had the chance to take a break. This makes it better, though."

_Something inside of me went off like a firework; a feeling, or, no... some desire._¬†_The desire to get even more physical. I wanted to get closer. I wanted to jump on top of Charlie and make out with him passionately while he continued to soap me down, but I held the impulse in as best as I could._

_What the fuck is going on with me right now? Why am I suddenly getting all these ideas?_

_I always saw myself as a pure-of-heart angel with child-like innocence, but... ever since I began to come to terms with who I was, my mind has been no short of fantasies. Dirty, naughty scenarios. I didn't know if it was a sexual breakthrough or a sexual breakdown._

_And right now, my mind has never been filthier._

My legs began to extend and spread out, loosening up my tight, frightened figure. As my feet slid further down the floor of the tub, my ankles brushed up against Charlie's, our fur meshing together between the water.

My breathing grew heavier as Charlie maneuvered his paws delicately around my chest. It tickled, but not in a way that would make me tense up and laugh; instead, it tickled in a way that _weakened_ me. I released deep sighs of relief as if Charlie's touch was melting away a strain that has been holding my body hostage for several years.

"You like that?" Charlie whispered, biting his lip.

I closed my eyes and tried to contain myself. I felt the joints in my face quiver as I attempted to articulate words, but nothing would come out. So I just nodded silently, as if I had no power over my voice, under Charlie's elusive spell.

"Good to know," he responded with a smirk.

He then scrubbed the fur on my head, a thick foam bubbling and coating my scalp. He gently fondled my ears and brushed his paws down my face, rubbing my cheeks and my whiskers, stroking my chin.

As much as I wanted to fight the feelings that were generating inside of me, I stood no match.¬†

_It felt so... fucking... good._¬†

I purred loudly in response to the euphoric sensation. It was my feline instinct. There was no way I _couldn't_ make a sound at this moment. _Luckily, it was only purring. And not anything else._

But, the more Charlie petted me, the more I felt myself give in to him.

I leaned forward with my eyes still closed, melting into Charlie's paws, and soon, his arms. I was unable to see where I was heading, but wherever I landed, it wouldn't matter. I was frail and delicate with ecstasy, and I loved it.

"Do you want to come closer?" Charlie whispered once again, noticing how pleased and delighted I was. Again, I nodded with no words spoken.

_Fuck, yes, Charlie, just..._¬†

_Just do whatever you want with me..._¬†

_Please..._

Charlie took matters into his own hands, figuratively and literally. He curled his arms around my torso and pulled me in, submerging me into a deep, cherished embrace. I lied my body down onto his chest, shifting my legs over in order to keep a certain body part of mine from touching any part of _his_ body.

Charlie leaned back, resting against the wall of the bathtub as he cradled me in his arms, sinking deeper into the water, the warmth swallowing us both whole.

Charlie cupped his paw and calmly scooped up some of the water from the tub, lightly daubing it over me to wash all the soap off of my upper body. I giggled softly from the tiny splatters, reminding me of our painting session last night. Charlie was so gentle and polite with the way he handled me.

I decided to repeat the same actions Charlie had done before. While still on top of him in the bath, I reached for the soap and squirted some into my own paw, eagerly scrubbing my substance-covered hands into his wet coat of fur. Charlie laughed and continued to caress my body while I did the same to his. His tail began to wag viciously behind him, showing his raging excitement. Fortunately, he was leaning his weight onto it so it wouldn't make a crazy mess, splashing into the water.

I rubbed my paws into his chest, his arms, his shoulders, his neck, and his head. I squeezed my paws around his tall, pointy ears as he had done to me, making us both wheeze with laughter. I splashed the water over him, making the fatal decision to shift my position, ending with me sitting _directly onto his lap._

I couldn't see anything that happened down below the water, but I felt it. I felt _everything_ underneath me, everything and anything. I couldn't describe it. I didn't want to.

I jumped a little, but Charlie's tender hold over my body eased my nerves.

I wasn't afraid to feel it.

I loosened my body once again, letting my muscles slacken as I grew more comfortable sitting on Charlie's lap. He stared into my eyes, knowing he felt the same way I did. He was definitely turned on, but _he_ knew that _I_ knew that _we_ would only do anything if _I_ was okay with it.

_And... I think I was._

He gently placed his paw on my stomach, just over my belly button.

He kept gazing at me intimately, our eyes matching, our hearts burning with passion.

_I didn't want to admit it, but Charlie was rock-fucking-hard._

_And I guess I was, too._

"Sky..?" Charlie whimpered, struggling to keep still. It looked like he was almost in pain. _He wanted me. Bad._¬†

I could tell he was trying so¬†hard to hold back his canine urges. I was also trying to hold back mine.

_But, what was the point in holding it back if we both wanted the same thing?_

"Charlie..." I moaned softly, my breath shaky and leaking with sexual desire.

_Will I regret this? Should I really be doing this? Is this right?_

Charlie slowly began to inch his paw down my stomach, reaching my abdomen before stopping.

_It's now or never, Skyler._

He communicated with nothing but his facial expression.¬†_Are you sure?_, he asked.

_You know what..?_

_Fuck it._

I responded with a sharp exhale. _Yes, oh, God, yes..._

  

I nodded, giving Charlie the consent he needed to advance.

Charlie moved his paw down even further.

  

He touched me.

He touched me in a way that was unlike any fantasy I could ever think of.

_I've never been touched before like this._

_No one's ever touched me in this way. Not even me._

  

Feelings generated as he continued to touch me.¬†

Feelings I've never felt before.

Emotions I've never received.

Thoughts, ideas, concepts I've never imagined.

  

_Was this good? Bad?_

_Was it right for us? Was it healthy?_

  

_Whatever it was, I fucking lusted over it._

_I craved this. My entire body was consumed with desire. Thirst. Greed._

_I didn't want him to stop._

And he didn't.

Charlie kept touching me and I didn't ask him to stop.

He kept going.¬†  

I gripped my paws into the strands of his fur.¬†

I held him so fucking tightly that I almost clawed wounds into his skin.

  

_Charlie kept touching me._

_And soon, I would be feeling a certain, climactic sensation that I never believed I could ever have._

\~~~

I lied down in the middle of our bed, staring at the ceiling.

It was quiet. Peaceful.

I could hear the gentle wind blowing outside as I sunk into the calming impression that the cozy bedsheets and fluffy pillows had against my newly clean, soft fur.

My mind rushed over all the things that had happened in the past half hour.

My legs were pressed up against one another, my bare feet intertwining. They gently rubbed against one another with subtle bliss.

The warm, velvety blanket of our bed cloaked my entire body. I held tightly onto the ends of the cloth, holding the sheet against my face, which was still a little damp. I sniffed it, detecting the scent of vanilla honey from the laundry I'd done recently.

I was wearing my pajamas, but I still felt naked and exposed.

I felt as though I had earned a new body after emerging from that bathtub. I was a new person with new wishes and wants. I had a new mindset, a new goal. _I was a new Skyler Clawfield now._

That was when I heard Charlie come out of the bathroom after getting ready for bed. He began to whistle as if nothing had happened and nothing had changed. He strolled over to the edge of the bed in his underwear, setting his sights down on me, hiding under the covers in the bed.

I looked up at him, but instead of maintaining eye contact, I found my eyes wandering. Towards certain parts of Charlie's body. His chest, his abs, and areas further down.

"You look cozy," he chuckled, joining me in the bed, hopping in on my left side.

Charlie crawled underneath the blankets, immediately wrapping his arms around me as he laid his body down atop of mine. His weight was heavier compared to how light I was, but I enjoyed being pressed down. The energetic husky hugged me firmly and smudged his face into my chest, inhaling deeply, gathering my scent through his nostrils. I hugged him back, patting him lightly against his spine.

He released a vocal sigh as he exhaled, nestling his snout into the small patch of fur that showed between the collar clefts of my pajamas.

"Obviously, I know that showering and bathing is important for your health and all," Charlie expressed, his voice muffled as his face was stuffed into my fur. "But, it always takes away that signature scent of yours. I only smell lavender and coconuts, not cotton candy."

"I smell like cotton candy?" I scoffed, rolling my eyes. _He can be so strange sometimes._

"Yeah, babe, you smell like sugar, spice, and everything nice."

"You're so weird."

Charlie lifted his body from mine and looked down at me in the bed, his image towering over me. "Admit it, snowflake, you love my weirdness. You can't change me."

"I don't think I could if I tried," I simpered, looking up at my bonehead of a boyfriend.

_His smile is so pretty._

_He's the cutest thing ever... So sweet and kind... and caring..._

_I feel so safe with him._

_I'm so happy that he's better now._

Charlie laughed and collapsed down onto the bed beside me, snuggling up to my left side. He rested his arm around my waist and gently fondled the sides of my torso, tickling my pressure points. He began to leave small kisses against my shoulder and collarbones, moving up to my neck.

I giggled, turning my head towards his, the tips of our noses touching.

I stared into his eyes as we both went quiet, allowing our romantic, amorous moment to last.

It was silent for a little bit.

We both laid there in our bed, not moving.

I held onto Charlie's paw, the one that caressed my sides, interlocking our connection.

I couldn't stop blushing. I squeezed my eyes shut, flustered beyond belief.  

Charlie gazed openly at me, his eyes emitting a sweet, tender feeling.¬†

Of love.

  

"Can I say somethi‚Äî" We both spoke aloud at the _exact same time._  

Our unison remark brought us both to more laughter. I clutched my paws over my mouth as Charlie touched my shoulders comfortingly.

"You can say what you were going to say first," I continued to giggle, only for Charlie to reply with, "No, you go first."

"Charlie, just go," I shook my head with a snickering groan. Charlie chuckled once more and obeyed.

"Alright, uh..." he gulped with a sigh. I watched as his mood slowly dropped from loving to apologetic in only a few seconds. "I... I'm sorry if you didn't want me to do that... I, sorta, did it without permission, but... I was just feeling it in the moment and I thought it was right, but if it wasn't, I'm so sorry‚Äî"

"No, no, Charlie, you were right,"¬†I relieved his doubts, touching my paw against his cheek. "It was the right moment. I was in it as well."  

"...I'm still so... surprised that... that actually happened," Charlie gasped, his eyes widening. _I don't think it's possible anyone could ever stare at you with as much love in their eyes as Charlie did with me._

_He was so happy. For me._

_I was happy, too._

_Things were beginning to look up._

"Me too," I marveled, still in a state of shock. I was out of breath from the subtle laughter.

"How did... _What_ allowed that to happen? Did I do something right?"

I took a second to think about it. _It was a tough question._

_How did this happen? So soon?_

_How did I go from such a frightened, traumatized kitten who cowered away in fear at the sheer mention of sex... to an unstable, hormone-crazed feline that now lusts for physical intimacy?_

_What has happened to me?_

_I've changed... but in a good way or a bad way?_

"I didn't... feel like I was trying to be _in_ the moment, Charlie..." I assumed, attempting to find the right words to explain how what happened, happened. "I was just there, with you, following my feelings. It's weird, I've always imagined that moments like those would be more _explicit_, but... I wasn't turned on by anything inherently sexual, I, just... I love you... and I love being with you... And I felt like I was, just, there with you, loving you. Showing my love for you... I think that's how it worked."

Charlie nodded his head. We were both floored, yet, exhilarated for whatever thrill-ride this could bring.¬†

Charlie grabbed my hands and held them lovingly, his paws wrapping over mine. "...Did you like it?"

"I did, Charlie," I whispered, "I really did."

"You..." Charlie hesitated, closing my eyes. "...you really finished?"

"This is the third time you've asked me this."

"Sorry, I'm just... stunned and... amazed..." We both continued to laugh aloud.

"I finished, Charlie," I repeated, reaching forward in the bed and hugging him tightly. "I don't know how or why, but somehow, I finished."

Charlie released a heavy sigh of relief, nuzzling his snout into my shoulder as I embraced him. "Was that... your first..."

Charlie had stopped, not wanting to say the 'o' word. I didn't want to say it either.

"...I think it was, Charlie."

"I gave you your first...?"

"You did."

"Was it... Was it good? Did you enjoy it? Did I do it right?"

"...Are you asking because you've never touched a guy like that before?"

"Well, I've only ever been with women sexually, this was my..."

"...First time with a guy?"¬†

_I said these things, while knowing that I still didn't see myself as a 'guy' anymore._

"Yeah, I guess."

_Charlie seemed to avoid claiming what he believed to be my gender._

_He probably could sense that I wasn't who I was made out to be._

_But, I wanted to spare him the conversation for tonight._

"...I guess this can be a first time for both of us," I said in response, changing the direction of our discussion.

Charlie hugged me tighter.

He seemed affected by this. In a positive way.

_I... never knew sex could hold such emotional value._

_When used in the right way, if you think about it, intercourse can be really beautiful..._

_A gateway to deepening a bond. Strengthening a relationship._¬†

_Somehow, sex can be pure and heartfelt._

_Because, after all, it's a method of showing love, is it not?_

_Showing love._¬†

_But, physically._

  

"...What did you want to tell me?" Charlie asked.

  

I carefully pushed Charlie away from our embrace, holding him out in front of me.

I stared into his eyes sincerely, my paws gripped tightly against his shoulders.

He seemed almost concerned by the sudden action, but he let me speak first before asking questions.

I took the opportunity.

"Charlie..." I started, ready to tell him something he's been waiting to hear the entire time we've been together. "...Look, I know that I've been... _'closeted'_ when it came to anything explicit-related with you... and I know that I've been using my disease and my trauma as an excuse to opt-out, but... I'm so, _so_ sorry that it took so long for me to open up to you‚Äî"

"Skyler, I promised to remain patient ever since the day I said that I loved you. It was my word, and I had to honor it‚Äî"

"I'm saying that I'm sorry in general, Charlie. I know that every relationship progresses in its own unique way, but... even then, I forced you to put aside what you wanted. But, you still did, _willingly_. So, thank you, Charlie..."

Charlie tilted his head with a melancholy expression, rubbing his thumb gently against my arm as I spoke, giving me the comfort and courage to keep talking.

"Thank you... _so much_ for being patient... because... I think that..."

I halted.

Charlie leaned in, knowing that what I was about to say would be groundbreaking.

I gathered the right words in my head.

The anticipation was killing him.

_Just say it, Skyler._

_You can trust him._

_He'll guide you every step of the way._

_He'll help you._

_Just tell him._

  

"...I think I'm ready."

"...Ready for what?"

  

"I... I want to lose my virginity to you, Charlie."

  

# 34. BABY STEPS

\~~~

## Charlie

### JUNE

I sat on the floor of our bedroom, surrounded by the painstakingly familiar red envelopes, scattered all over the carpet.

The CSI-reminiscent bulletin board that I had put together at my father's apartment stood before me, leaning against the wall similarly to how I was leaning my back against the foot frame of our bed.

I stared down at the one letter from my mother that I've been rereading way too much lately. Even though the actual message was much longer, I've only been revisiting that one paragraph. The one that struck me so much when I skimmed through all the letters for the first time.

**_...It reminded me of you, Charlie. It reminded me of that memory we had together, when I taught you how to ride that bike outside of your father's house. Well, I mean, not 'taught', but, you still rode that thing like a bird rides the wind. I was so proud of you. I wish I could've given you more memories like that. I'm so sorry I left you, Charles. If I could come back to get you, I would..._**  

_It's one of my favorite memories. I can't believe Mom still remembers it._

_Or, at least, she did._

"Charlie!" I heard Skyler call from a distance, startling me out of my internal trance. My whole body shook as I jerked my head over to him, clasping the letter to my chest.¬†

Sky stood in the doorway, waiting expectantly for an unresponsive me. "I've been calling your name from the lobby for the past five minutes."

"Sorry, I-I didn't know you got back from the store yet," I let down my guard, relieving my jittery grip on the letter.

"Can you help me bring the groceries in?" He requested, to which I immediately sat up from the floor, nodding my head. Skyler then focused his attention on the letter in my hands, to which I held onto carefully. "...Still trying to find clues?" He assumed.

"...Reminiscing, I guess," I chuckled softly, lightening the claustrophobic mood even though the two of us were far across the room from one another.

"You need to be alone?" Sky sympathized, leaning against the door frame.

"Nah, just give me a second," I shook my head, folding up the letter.

"Well, hurry up, I'm not doing this all by myself, you know I'm too weak," Skyler casually bantered, turning around and disappearing down the hallway.

Once I was alone again, I looked down at the one letter I cherished so deeply. More than all the others. I folded it up and delicately slid it into its assigned envelope, approaching my briefcase. I hid the letter inside, separating it from all the rest, not wanting anyone but me to come near it.¬†

It felt unjust to say, but that letter was my favorite out of all of them.

\~~~

The two of us walked out onto the driveway as the sun began to set amongst the horizon. After lugging all the groceries from my car into the kitchen, Skyler and I began to unpack the plastic bags and assort the different items. Skyler accordingly put away the milk, eggs, and other food-related items into the fridge as I stocked up the cabinets with ingredients. We stored all the used plastic bags in a container under the sink for other purposes as our part in trying not to murder the environment. The only bag that wasn't made of plastic was a small paper baggie on the counter, stabled with a label from the pharmacy. I approached it with interest, staring at the label.

"So, you go back to work tomorrow, right?" Skyler tried his best to catch up as he shifted frozen things around in the freezer.

"Yeah, for post-production," I answered his question, picking up the brown bag. "Is this my medication?"

"Yeah, it's those PrEP meds that the doctor prescribed yesterday," Skyler told me, smacking his hands together as he shut the freezer door closed. He walked over to my side and examined the bag along with me as I ripped it open. "It takes seven days to take full effect, so in a week or so, we'll be... _safe_... to do things, I guess. But, just as a precaution, I also bought‚Äî"

I reached into the bag and pulled out two items, the small bottle of meds and a miniature package of _condoms._¬†

"‚ÄîProtection," I finished his sentence.

Skyler took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. "Yup," he winced as he bit his cheeks awkwardly.

"So, I have to wait seven days to fuck you?" I smirked, tossing the items onto the dining table counter in a jokingly suave manner, leaning my arm against it.

"Presumably, yes," Skyler blushed, hiding his face away as he directed his sight towards anywhere other than my eyes. "But... that doesn't mean we can't... _test things out."_

I nodded my head with a subtle grin. Skyler visibly gulped down his saliva before saying his next words, cueing me to believe that it'll be more serious than sultry. "Look, Charlie, if we really want to do this, we have to take action as safely as possible. I don't know how long it'll take for me to grow accustomed to this... It might take forever, it might happen immediately, you never know with me, but... I feel as though, recently, I've been getting a better hold on my emotions, so I don't believe it'll be much of a hassle. I think I'll be okay, but that's just a feeling. We just have to be safe, alright? You're as much at risk as I am in this."

"Seven days is enough to prepare ourselves," I smiled warmly, reaching my paw over to his and squeezing it delicately. Skyler closed his eyes as his face lit up with delight. He tried hard to fight the bubbly feelings absorbing his core, but of course, Skyler Clawfield couldn't subdue a smile, ever.

"You know what else is in seven days?" Skyler whispered, getting closer and angling his head up to mine, the touch of our lips nearing ever so slightly.¬†

"...We don't have to make a big deal about it, Sky..." I whispered back, brushing the topic aside.

"I know that the circumstances are different this time around, considering you never celebrated your birthday because of your mother..." Skyler tilted his head, our noses so close that only atoms were left in between. "...but a birthday is a birthday, and it's going to be yours soon. And that'll always be a big deal to me."

_Skyler was right._¬†

_It was the first day of June and the 7th was my birthday. For some reason, I still have this hope that every year people forget I even have a birthday so I don't have to go through all the trouble of dissuading everyone to treat it normally._¬†

_I've always hated my birthday. It was always a reminder of the day my mother had left me alone with my father, which in turn, doomed me for the rest of my life. But, after uncovering the recent news, my birthday hurts even harder this year._

_I had no desire to celebrate it. But, I didn't want to let others down for being a buzzkill._

"I just don't want to do anything big," I exhaled through my nose, holding Skyler gently by the arm and caressing his fur with my thumb. "In fact, I just don't want to do _anything_ in general. I don't think I can handle a party right now."

"What about just a small get-together with Jonathan, Claire, and Becca? It's been so long since the five of us were in the same room together," Skyler pushed with another comforting smile, hoping for the best.¬†

"...Can't it just be us?" _I felt selfish for asking, but I really didn't have it in me._ "I'm sorry, I know you love to celebrate, but... all I really need is just a quiet, peaceful day spent with my favorite person in the world to feel like I deserve another year on this planet."

Skyler bit his lip and closed his eyes as he sighed, knowing he couldn't push anymore. "It's _your_ birthday, Charlie."

"Yeah, so maybe I deserve a little appreciation," I laughed, grabbing Skyler by the paw and stepping back for an elaborate, romantic gesture. I pulled on his hand and spun him around into my arms, snaking my limbs around the kitten and smothering him whole. Skyler giggled, pressing his paws up against my chest.

We looked into each other's eyes for a while, absorbing the calm while it lasted.

"You only were gone for an hour, but it felt like a year," I muttered below my breath. "I haven't asked how your day has been yet. How was your day?"

"Same old nothing. How was yours?"

"...It feels good to be able to take a break once in a while."

"I'm glad you're getting that chance," Skyler nodded his head as I looked to the floor. "How's it going with your investigation?"

"I don't know, Sky..." I breathed out in defeat, rolling my eyes to the ceiling. "I feel like I'm chasing after a ghost. There's no way I'll be able to find her with the evidence I have. It almost seems pointless."

"But it's your mother," Sky worried, softly touching the side of my face. "Are you thinking of giving up?"

"I gave myself a short window of time that's now up, so I'm not really sure whether it's worth it to keep going or move on," I expressed, shaking my head. "And now that I think about it, what would I even do if I _did_ find her? Reunite, and then what? Forgive? Go on with our lives? What would happen, w-would we try to get close again, or would we drift apart? Would she even recognize me? Would I recognize her?"

"Charlie, I understand..."

"I still don't even know if I'm mad at her or not. She never came back for me, even now, she never returned. Should I be mad about that or should I be worried?"

"...Look, I'm as much in the dark as you are in this, Charlie, I... I don't know what's right. But, to me, I personally think that whatever makes _you_ happy and content is the right choice. Okay?"

I nodded my head.

_Maybe he's right._

_Maybe I should be focusing on getting better myself._

\~~~  

I could hear the water shut off, the sound of Skyler stepping out of the shower echoing from inside of the bathroom. I stayed put in the same position I had been in almost all day before Sky got back: on the floor, aimlessly staring at what lay in front of me.

_I've been looking at these red fucking envelopes for days now. Like I told Sky before, I don't really know what the point is anymore. I'm not even reading them now, I've just been staring. All I've been doing... is staring. To no avail._

_My little investigation isn't growing in the slightest. There have been no new developments. No new revelations. Other than the fact that I feel like this search of mine is starting to become an excuse to act out._

My train of thought was immediately derailed when I felt two cuddly arms cloaked in a soft, fuzzy bathrobe submerge me from behind.

Skyler had joined me on the floor and was snuggling up against my back, pressing the side of his face into the back of my neck as he hugged me fiercely. He then whispered in the lightest tone of voice, "Coming to bed?"¬†

No words could describe the warm, cozy feeling that always rushed through my body whenever Skyler hugged me. The tips of my mouth curled upwards as I slightly turned my head in his direction, catching only a glimpse of the side of his face behind me. "Back off, you leech."

Skyler giggled and released his hold on me, climbing onto the bed from the foot of it. I followed in pursuit, grateful to leave the mess on the floor behind. As I crawled onto the mattress adorned by the comforting blankets and pillows, Skyler eagerly gripped my shirt by the collar and pulled me into a kiss with excitement. The two of us plowed down onto the bed, my body atop his, a brand new make-out session ensuing.

Skyler's fur was still damp and fresh from the shower, his body clean and pure as it usually was. He was wearing only a bathrobe, with assumingly nothing underneath, considering he fastened the belt sash incredibly tight. He usually didn't dress light like this, but I wasn't complaining. Our limbs were intertwining, our legs weaving together, making my own fur a little moist. The idea that I could just rip off the robe and expose him for my own eyes excited both me _and_ Skyler. My hands maneuvered around his waist, feeling the skeletal grooves of his torso underneath the thick cotton material. Skyler traced his fingers along my back in abstract shapes. It felt so good. All of it.

_He's the only thing that keeps me sane._

Skyler's paws ruffled around my head, releasing soft gasps as he kissed me. His chest broadened with every intake of air his lungs could get between the contact of our lips, which created an unfortunate airtight bond. His hands then moved to my shoulders, where they politely broke off the kiss as Sky held me back.

"Um..." Skyler hesitated, his face visibly heating up. I could tell he was trying not to giggle with embarrassment over whatever he was about to say. "...Do you think we could maybe... try a few things out?"

It took me a second to process, considering that Skyler was never usually the one to suggest taking things a step further, but I didn't want him to feel alienated, so I immediately blurted out, "Yeah, do you want me to wear protection?"

"Yes, but, um... we're not going to actually _do_ anything yet," Skyler explained awkwardly from below me, directing his eyes away from mine. "I... I guess I just want the chance to 'ready' myself, if you... know what I mean."

"Yeah, of course, Sky," I smiled, petting his head gently. "What were you thinking?"

"Well..." Skyler then put on a more serious look on his face, changing the mood of the room. "The thing is," he glanced around the room as if someone could be listening in. "I haven't really had... anything... 'enter' me... ever since what happened in college. When I was..."

_Ooh, okay, touchy subject... but I'm happy Skyler is able to be open about it with me this time around._¬†_I just need to keep comforting him in order to make Sky feel safe and secure with me._¬†

"Yes... Yeah, I understand," I spoke sincerely, brushing my paw up and down his arm.

"I don't know... if I'm exactly _prepared_ to have something..." Skyler then just blurted it all out at once to get the talking portion of this conversation over with, "‚Äîinside of my body again, so, maybe we could just try‚Äî_you_ could just try to... Not, like, sex, but just..."

"I know what you mean, Sky." I held him tenderly by the sides of his face, kissing the tip of his nose as his head sunk further into the pillows.

"Are you okay with it?"  

"Are _you_ okay with it?"

Skyler nodded with a heartfelt smile, yet, unsure eyes.

I didn't know what to make of it, but I accepted the consent as it was. I'll just be careful around him, in case things didn't go to plan.

I lifted my body off of him, crawling across the bed to the left side and acquiring the box of condoms that Skyler had bought today at the pharmaceutical. Skyler laid in the bed, shifting his position to feel a little more comfortable, yet he still seemed awkward. I kicked off my pants, knowing I wouldn't need them anyway since I always just slept in my drawers, while simultaneously taking out one of the small wrapped packages inside the box. I held it firmly in my paw and came back over to Skyler, looming over him once again.

"You sure you're ready for this?"

"It's not sex."

"It's still something meaningful."

"If it's meaningful, then I'm ready."

"...Alright, Sky."¬†

I grabbed the blanket that had been kicked to the foot of the bed and pulled it forward, draping it over me and Skyler. I adjusted the position of my knees, arching my legs over Skyler's own like a bridge hanging over water, situating a more comfy orientation. "Does this make you feel safer?"

Skyler nodded sweet and innocently, placing his paws on his chest.¬†

I grinned subtly, giving him an assuring look with my eyes. He had definitely received the warmth I was trying to deliver. I then intricately ripped open the plastic and removed the deflated balloon-like object from the wrapper.

Skyler stared up at the ceiling, choosing not to watch as I lowered a certain article of clothing from my waist and applied the protection. I could hear Sky's breathing grow a little louder, but not faster. He took deep inhales and exhales, channeling a state of calm.

I threw the leftover wrapper off of the bed, finished and ready to go. I lowered my body onto my arms and knees, slightly hovering over Skyler, who was now closing his eyes.

"Hey, you okay?"

"Just do it, Charlie," he braced for impact, squinting his eyes as if he expected to feel pain sometime soon.

"Sky, if you're uncomfortable..."

"I'm not, I-I'm comfortable‚ÄîI'm ready, I am," Skyler ranted, shaking his head as he bared his teeth. He was anticipating contact, but I was barely anywhere close to entering him.

"Skyler, it's okay if you're afraid‚Äî" I slowly began to back up, lifting weight off of my arms and rising steadily.

"I'm not! I'm ready, Charlie, really," Skyler opened his eyes, yet he could not look at me. The ceiling was his only direction to stare in.

"...I don't think you are, Sky."

"Stop talking, just do it!" Sky whimpered, his face scrunching up as anguish overcame him. He pressed his paws to his face, trying to calm himself down.

"I'm not doing this, Sky," I sighed, climbing off of Skyler and lying down on the bed beside him. "Not when you're uncomfortable."

"Shit..." Sky whispered, giving up on trying, knowing he couldn't continue. He rubbed his temples with frustration. "I don't understand...."

"Sky, sweetheart, it's gonna be okay." I removed the condom from my body and tossed it at a trash can in the corner. I pulled up my boxers and then turned in the bed, resting on my side to face a discouraged Skyler.

"Why can't I do it..? What is wrong with me..?"

"Nothing is wrong with you. Just think, Sky. What caused you to react?"

"...I was scared."

"Of what?"

"...That it was going to hurt."

"Why?"

"Because it did when _he_ did it."

I went quiet. Skyler sighed drastically and covered his face with his paws. I closed my eyes and exhaled through my mouth slowly, knowing we reached another touchy subject.¬†

"_He_ did it so aggressively, that he..." Skyler began to admit memories from a moment in time that should've long been forgotten, "...he injured me. And I know four years is enough time for a scar to heal, but I'm scared of, like‚Äîopening up a new one, you know?"

I used my arm to hold up my head as I looked down at Skyler, resting in the bed with his eyes still situated on the small crack in the ceiling. "I know. And I hear you, Sky. That's terrifying." Skyler then glanced over at me. He gave me this look that showed that he valued my presence; he valued that I was here and able to listen to him when he had something to get off his chest.

"I'm so sorry..." Skyler whined, shaking his head. "I fucked up our night."

"Don't apologize."

"I thought I could do it..." he grumbled somberly in defeat, "I thought I was getting better."  

"You are, Sky. You're making progress‚Äî"

"‚ÄîI'm making fucking baby steps," Sky groaned, pushing his head back into the pillow as far as he could. "Yeah, sure, I'm making progress, but what good is it if I'm getting nowhere?"

"You got _somewhere_. Two days ago, Sky, the bath. You had your first... you know..."

"I don't know how I did it... I don't know what was different..." Sky contemplated, whispering these things to himself as if I weren't meant to hear it.

"We'll figure it out, Sky."

"Maybe..." Skyler opened his eyes, a theory coming to mind. "Maybe... it was because we weren't trying?"

"What do you mean?"

Skyler cleared his throat, turning his head in my direction to face me dead-on. "We... We weren't trying to do anything inherently sexual..." Sky began to whisper, "it was just supposed to be an 'intimate' moment together. Maybe that's what did it for me. We weren't _trying_ to have sex, we were just... spending time together like normal people and I didn't feel pressured or obligated to do anything sexual, no, it was just me... there with you... and that allowed me to feel comfortable... and I let my guard down because I _knew_ we weren't trying to do anything. We were just being ourselves."

"So... we have to find a way to make you understand that sex isn't an obligation. It's just loving on a deeper level." Sky nodded his head in response. "Well... what am I gonna do, trick you into sex?"

"No, no, it's, just..." Skyler bit his lip, trying not to laugh at my jokes. "...I want it to be real. In the moment. I don't want us to plan it or stage it, I... I just want us to do it. Whenever the opportunity comes. Whenever it feels the most real."

_That last sentence had suddenly hit me out of nowhere in a way I couldn't describe._

_No, not the last sentence, the last word._

_'Real'._

_What our relationship hasn't been for the past week._

_Largely due to me._

  

"...Are you okay?" Skyler asked after a prolonged silence of me staring into space.

"Huh?" I answered, causing Sky to touch the side of my face with his paw.

"You seem upset."

I rested my hand on Skyler's. "I'm fine," I spoke, only to remember a promise I had made recently to Skyler. He gave me a look that told me he was thinking of the exact same thing I was thinking of. "R-Right, sorry, I'm not allowed to say that anymore." I shifted my bottom jaw around as I tried to gather the right words to describe my inner feelings. "I'm, just... worried."

"About what?"

"You. I feel like I'm forcing this all on you."

"What are you talking about?"

"I don't know... Lately, I... I've been such a terrible boyfriend to you, Sky..." I mumbled, looking down at the blankets beneath me, the shame of my own actions taking over. "...I've been abusive and simple-minded and I took all my anger out on you... and now I'm forcing this sex shit on you again for, like, the hundredth time."

"Hey, you're not, I suggested this."

"I was the one who ran the bath and put this _thing_ back into our lives."

"And I chose to get in. Look, Charlie, we've both made mistakes. We haven't had the healthiest relationship, I get that. But what matters is that we're trying to get better. Why? Because we love each other. And that love overpowers everything else."

"I just feel so guilty. I want to be better, really, I _want_ to be a better man to you, Sky. I want to _prove_ that I'm more than what I debase myself as, _God_... I just want to be Charlie Cooperton again." I let out a long and drawn-out sigh, relieving myself. I lowered my head and rested it on Skyler's chest, nestling my face into the soft cotton of the robe. Sky cupped his paws around my head as I allowed myself to collapse into his cherishing embrace.

"You will always be Charlie Cooperton," Sky whispered into my ear. "Even if he hides away sometimes, there's _always_ a way to get him back out. There's always a key to every door, right?"

"You're my key," I muttered, my voice muffled. Skyler began to chuckle at my words, causing me to un-stuff my face and lean my chin on his chest instead. I stared into his eyes as our faces grew closer, unable to stay further apart. "As cliche as that sounds, you are. You bring out the best in me, Sky, and sometimes, I just fail to recognize that. And that's why I get so fucked up..."

Sky kept fondling the fur on my head, showing me heartfelt emotions with nothing but a glimmer in his eyes. _His eyes... God, his eyes... I could get so easily lost in them._

_Everything about Skyler feels so perfect to me. Every single part of him makes him whole, there's not one aspect I could lose, even if it were one single whisker or tuft of fur. I need nothing less, nothing more. Skyler is everything to me. Skyler is enough._

My fingers began to wander around the cotton strands of his robe, feeling every inch and wrinkle in the material. They traced around the edges, leading my fingers down the middle lining. I could see small threads of his blue fur peeking through.

"I have an idea..." I murmured. Skyler's ears perked up, interested. "Baby steps, right?"

I sat up and grabbed the collar of my shirt, pulling it over my head and stripping it from my body entirely. Skyler sat up as well, wondering what the plan was.

"Take off your clothes," I requested politely, gently touching him by the shoulders. Skyler seemed confused, but he didn't seem uncomfortable. In fact, he was intrigued. "Trust me, okay? We're not gonna do anything. I only want to look at you."

"You want to look at me? Naked?" Skyler assumed, a small smirk creeping onto his face.

"If you're comfortable with that. And you can look at me, too."

"Well... I got in a bathtub with you..." Skyler shrugged, releasing a breathy laugh. His paws wandered onto the blankets, grabbing them tightly. "Just... promise me this won't be weird."

I placed my paw firmly on his shoulder, brushing it up his neck delicately. "I'll make sure it isn't weird. I promise."

Skyler's grin grew wider as the blush on his face grew redder. He shyly nodded his head towards the lamp on the bedside table behind me, the only source of light in the room. "Can you at least turn out the light..?"

I chuckled and leaned forward, kissing him on the forehead. "I'll do that." I then turned around and reached for the lamp from the mattress, just barely grabbing the little knob underneath the lampshade, switching it off with a flick.

That was when everything shifted.

Now, only the bright, beaming moon from the window was the only thing illuminating the dark bedroom. I could see Skyler's nearly opaque image as my vision began to adapt to the darkness, the pitch-black haziness fading away, allowing for a more intimate mood to take over.

We were officially _alone_.¬†

Even if we lived by ourselves, without the light, _no one_ could see us.¬†

_No one._

Only small refractions of the moonlight peered through the rectangular silhouettes offered by the stiffly shaped windows. The faded spotlight it gave Skyler, sitting there kindly on the bed in his robe, harmlessly waiting for me to come closer... it made my senses go wild.

_So much can happen in the dark. So little, too._

_But that's what's so endearing about it. The mystery. The unknown. The excitement._

_And with that excitement, I acted on my feelings._

Knowing that I was in full view from Skyler's perspective, I reached down.

The shadow caused by my body blocking the moonbeams projected over Skyler, making it feel like I was towering over him, prepared to control and dominate. By any means necessary.

I grabbed ahold of my boxers and stripped down fully, exposing myself first to show Sky that it was all going to be okay.

Skyler did not look away this time.

His eyes scanned up and down, occasionally halting on areas that interested him.¬†

He tried his best to make no visual expressions.

He took a few more seconds before making his decision.

Though it was dark, the sight of him was clear as day.

Skyler was ready.

He grabbed the belt of his robe and untied it.

He gripped the edges of the cloak and slowly, with intense precision, undressed himself.

Skyler's chest was revealed to me first.¬†

Then his shoulders.¬†

Then his arms and his stomach, and soon enough, the robe was completely gone.

  

I stared at him for a good minute.

I took in the sight with gratitude and satisfaction.

I analyzed every detail: the unique pattern of his fur, the curves of his small waist, his defined collar bones, the shadows detailing every ridge that made his chest and abdominal muscles stand out, the way his neck connected his head to his torso in such a perfect and corporal fashion, his quivering legs and the way his knees bent inwards together, what lied between his limbs; the _entire_ package... _All of it, together, unleashed for me and my eyes only._

Skyler wrapped his arms around his waist and looked up at me, an innocence or purity radiating off of him. He was shy, defenseless, susceptible... but _open_. He was all there, every part of him.

I set forth, crawling over the blankets on my hands and knees, meeting him in the middle.

Sky bit his lip. His breath was shaky with desire. His gaze was erotic.

Skyler wanted to be held, touched, cherished, so _badly_ in this moment. I could read him like a fucking book. He wanted to be mine and _mine only._¬†

Our muzzles couldn't stand being apart any second longer. We kissed. I wrapped my arms around him as he did the same to me. We lowered ourselves down onto the bed and continued to kiss.

"Oh, God..!" Skyler moaned in reaction, to which I asked, "You okay?", to which he breathily responded with, "Yeah, yeah, I'm okay..."

Our bodies, exposed and raw, collided. Every inch of my fur meshed with the blue-pink catalog of Skyler's own coat. Our limbs twisted and entwined, our saliva seeped into each other's mouths, no surface went untouched. I didn't know where my skin stopped and his started.

Amorous, seductive, salacious feelings generated as a certain member of my body collided with his. I could feel myself thrust with delicacy against him, every part of me below my waist acting with passionate, ticklish thrill. I felt like kicking my feet as a response to the adrenaline rush I was receiving from grinding against Skyler like this. The suppressed wagging of my tail by the heavy blankets was enough to show how much I was restraining my sexual instincts.

With fierce and heated passion, I moved my lips from Skyler's mouth to his neck, sinking my teeth in. Skyler moaned even louder, unafraid of how noisy he could be.

I moved deeper. I kissed his chest, his stomach. I grabbed his legs and hoisted them up from the bed, allowing for my muzzle to reach the calves. I began to kiss his knees and the inner surfaces of his thighs, causing Skyler to squeal. "Ah! Charlie!" He wheezed with rapid laughter, unable to contain himself.

I stopped myself from going any further, dropping his legs back down onto the bed and climbing back over him, connecting my mouth once again to his. Skyler couldn't stop silently laughing in-between kisses.

By the time the both of us could barely even breathe anymore, we halted our practices and released our desires. We both knew that if we went any further, it would become unsafe. Our temptations were being tested, but Skyler and I knew that patience was a virtue. I fell down and slumped onto him, catching my breath as Skyler did the same, breathing in and out slowly. "Oh, my god..." He gasped, caressing my back with no purpose other than just to feel me.

"Do you like this?" I asked with the softest, deepest whisper I could utter.¬†

"Yes," Skyler expressed determinately. "Fuck, yes..."

"Told you," I sighed with pleasure, tapping his nose lightly. "You're getting better, see?"

"I can't wait 'til we can actually do it."

"Neither can I."

Skyler closed his eyes and breathed out a deep exhale once more, leaving behind only a wide, prominent smile on his adorable kitten face. I was so proud of him. I snuggled in closer, touching and stroking the fur on his head, grazing his ears and soaking up every ounce of his texture.

"You're making progress, Sky, I know it," I told him, tried and true. "You always have. Every day since I've met you, I watched how much you've grown. I've seen it. I know you, Skyler. You may seem weak and vulnerable... but you are _strong_. So strong. In so many ways. Just you being here is proof of how strong you are."

Skyler's eyes watered with joy.

"What are you, Sky?"

"...Strong."

"Say it."

"I'm strong."

"Again."

"I'm _strong."_

"You are _so_¬†_fucking_ _strong_, Skyler."

Skyler tilted his head and stared at me, dead in the eyes.

"...So are you, Charlie."

# 35. BLUE'S CLUES

\~~~

## Skyler

_...Things have been feeling closer to normal recently._

_And at the same time, far from normal._

_The following week had gone just like any other week, while simultaneously unlike anything I've ever experienced before. Charlie had returned to his job, I returned to mine. Relationship-wise, the two of us back to being our odd, unusual selves, yet with the strange addition of... experimenting. We've been taking up a lot of our free time to test things out, (i.e., what I liked, what I didn't like, what turned me on, and what felt right between the both of us. Charlie was also a factor in this. We needed to know what we both were okay with.) I've slowly been slipping out of my shell, more and more as the days went by. If I thought I was close to Charlie before, this brought things to a whole new level._

"Girl, I lost it at 'experimenting'," I heard Claire wheeze with laughter over the phone call. I sat up from the bed and leaned my back against the pillows, picking up my phone and holding it close to my voice.

"I feel like a different person," I expressed, "I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing."

"Well, sure, it's a little sad to see that old, innocent, pure-hearted Skyler phase drift away..." Claire remorsed over the recollection of who I was in college, sending me even more memories to bawl over. "...But, Sky, to me, this is incredible. You're finally getting a grip on being a _full person_. You're stronger, more responsible, not afraid to share your feelings... and now you're horny! Win-win!"

I felt my face burn red as I slapped my paw against it with embarrassment.

"I'm being serious, though," Claire's tone became more proud and sincere. "Even if younger Skyler will be missed, you're a¬†_new_ person now. A strong, confident woman. Someone younger Skyler could look up to."

"...Yeah, almost there..." I sighed, thinking about the few issues left to resolve.

"I'm guessing you still haven't told Charlie?" Claire assumed. I sunk deeper into the pillows of the bed and lied down on my side, cloaking the blanket over me and covering my whole body.

"It's not just Charlie... How will I tell my family? And everyone else? ...Is it weird that I feel like I'd be... annoying them?"

"Sky, what do you mean by that?" Claire said in a way that made it seem like I was stupid for thinking that. I probably was.

"I don't know... I'm scared people are going to think I did this for attention. I..." I flipped onto my back, the blanket smothering my face. "I don't want attention. At all, actually. I don't want to be asked questions or made aware that I'm trans, I just want it to be like... I was _always_ female. I wish, my whole life, I was female and nothing changed. That way, I wouldn't have to go through the whole process of coming out to everyone. It's so hard and stressful..." _Now that I think about it, my whole life would've been so much better if I had just been assigned female at birth._

"I understand, Sky. I won't hold it against you. But, I really don't think people are going to be annoyed. Everyone loves you, Sky. You're, like, at the center of everyone's hearts."

"You really think so?"

"Jesus Christ, totally! You know how I have those really judgemental friends from college? The ones you met that one time?"

I nodded.

Then I realized she can't see me because it's a phone call.

"Yeah."

"They're salty about everyone. And I mean, _everyone_. They even hate Jonathan. But whenever I mention you, their eyes, just, like, _light up_ and their hearts _glow_. They say shit like, 'aww, I love Skyler!' and they always ask how you are and... Sky, you have no idea how happy you make people."

"I answered a phone call, not a crying session," I laughed, rubbing my eyes before they got anywhere close to welling up.

"But, yeah, you get my point. No one is going to hate you for this." Claire then spoke more slowly and sincerely. "_Charlie_ would never hate you for this."

I gulped and closed my eyes, taking in the suggestion. "I don't know when to tell him."

"Sky, his birthday is tomorrow, could it be more perfect?!"

"I don't want to take the attention away from him, it's _his_ day, not mine."

"Well, find the right time. And it better be soon, okay?" Claire supported me, making me feel even more confident in myself. "And are you _sure_ Charlie doesn't want a party? The five of us would have such a fun night together."

"He said he only wants to spend the day with me," I sighed, also in disagreement. "...Maybe we'll celebrate another day, like... on the 4th of July, when we go to that festival-thing we attend every year," I plotted, trying to come up with different ways to celebrate Charlie. "Speaking of, have you reached out to Becca?"

Claire went quiet for a bit. Then, in a somber tone, "She texted me a few days ago. All she said was 'I need space'. It's been a week since and nothing else."

"...At least we know she's okay."

"Is she?" Claire questioned, seemingly not me, but herself. "I'm so worried, Sky, I'm afraid she's gonna hurt herself."

"Is there anywhere you think she would've gone?"

"No, not really. She was never the type of person that stuck to one place. She was always moving." I could hear Claire's audible fear over the phone. "Of _course_, her house _had_¬†to be a van and, of _course_, she _had_ to take it with her," Claire spoke with frustration.

"...I don't think she's going to hurt herself."

"You think?"

"...She reminds me of myself in high school. Sometimes, I had ideas... but I never went through with them because... I had a loving family to look after. Becca has us. And I don't think she would risk anything when she has us."

"I really hope you're right."

I pulled the blanket off of me, sitting up straight and slumping over my crossed legs. "Me and Becca connected in a way that was different. You're not the only one who knows her in a deeper sense."

Claire exhaled shakily, trying to calm her nerves. "Thank you, Skyler. I think I'm still gonna search for her, though."

"You do what you feel is right."

That was when I heard the distant sound of the front door being unlocked from the main lobby. "Uh‚ÄîSorry to cut this short, but Charlie's home. I'll text you later, okay?"

"Of course, have fun experimenting!" Claire shifted back to her cheery self in a matter of seconds. "Just don't die choking on his dick!"

"Screw you. Love you!"

"Love you, too!"

I hung up the phone and immediately threw it off the bed, which inconspicuously landed on the pile of red envelopes on the carpet. I grabbed a book from the bedside table and situated myself into a more comfortable position, fluffing the pillows behind me urgently as I heard the front door open. I grabbed the blanket and pulled it up over my waist and rested the open book against my legs, pretending that I had been in the middle of an intense reading session. I exhaled calmly and settled in, hoping that this modest disposition will tend to Charlie's needs after a long day of work.

I could hear Charlie come down the hallway, his steps staggered. The exact moment he entered the bedroom, he groaned and threw his briefcase on the floor, and immediately tore off his polo shirt by the buttons. He then jumped, head-first, into the bed, collapsing like a ragdoll and landing his face onto my lap.

"Oh, Jesus‚Äî!" I grunted at the sudden impact, followed by some laughter. "Are you okay, birthday boy?"

Charlie just released a long and excruciatingly drawn-out moan into my stomach, burying his face deeper. He kicked off his shoes over the side of the bed and crawled in, curling his body in closer to mine.

"Long day?" I asked, petting his head and going back to my reading.¬†

"No, actually, very light day. The whole post-production process is the best because you can see all the stuff you worked hard on come together as a whole. It's my favorite part of the moviemaking business, it's so satisfying and relaxing and..."¬†Charlie turned his head onto his side and looked up at me, showing off his puppy-dog eyes. "I'm just groaning because I missed you."

"Cry about it."

"Damn, not even some consolation?"

Charlie then lifted himself up and sat beside me, pulling the blanket out from under his feet and covering his legs. He cuddled up to me and rested his head on my shoulder. "Whatcha' doin'?"

"Readin'."

"Readin' what?"

"A book."

"What book?"

"The one with pages and words." I then closed the book and turned to face Charlie. "So, I've been thinking about what we can do tomorrow and I've set up a possible schedule."

"Ooh, I'm listening," Charlie inquired, leaning in with interest.

"Alright, so, _first_, we can start off the day with morning cuddles and stuff‚Äî"

"‚ÄîLike every morning‚Äî"

"‚ÄîYes, like every morning, and then, maybe I can make you breakfast in bed, 'cause I'm such a good gir‚Äîpartner."

"Loving this plan so far."

"Then, since you don't have work, we can hang out all day! The ideas I had were: a trip to the beach, but no swimming because I hate the water‚Äî"

"‚ÄîYou look like a damp mop when you're wet‚Äî"

"‚Äîand then maybe a movie marathon! We can order pizza, or whatever kind of unhealthy food we desire, and just relax the whole day."

"Ooo, maybe we can order from a bunch of different places and see how much shit we can digest until we throw up!"

"Yeah... _you_ can do that... Then, possibly, after the marathon, another night out in LA that doesn't include homophobic rich people!"

"Ah, fuck yeah!"

"And finally, when we get back and it's, like, one in the morning..."

"...I like where this is headed." Charlie's prominent smirk transferred onto my face contagiously.¬†

"...We can do whatever we want..." I looked into his eyes, touching his bottom lip with my finger seductively, naughty thoughts being shared between our dirty minds.¬†

"...Sounds like a perfect plan." Charlie leaned in for a kiss.

"What can I say, you dated the right person." I gave him the kiss he so desperately desired. "Now, stay here, I'm gonna make you a pre-birthday dinner."

"Oh, wow, surprise after surprise!" Charlie gasped, his devilish eyes glued to my image as I stood up on the bed and climbed over him, getting to the other side.

"I'm makin' mac and cheese," I told him as I jumped off the bed and headed for the door.

"Oh my God, I _love_ you."

"I know, I'm so good, right?"

\~~~

Charlie stared at me, swooning intently, as I stirred the metal pot filled with macaroni over the stove. I shared short, small glances at him with furrowed brows, a little weirded out by his silent observations.

"I can't tell if you're drooling over me or the food," I joked, brandishing the large wooden spoon against the rim of the pot and bringing it over to the sink.

"What's the difference?"

"You're not funny." I returned to the stove and picked up the pot by the rubber handle, setting it down on the dining table counter in front of Charlie.

"I love how you didn't even give me a bowl."

"You're Charlie, you would've eaten out of the pot anyway." I grabbed two forks from the drawer and tossed him one. He caught it and immediately stuck it into the pot of macaroni. I sat down on the other side of the table and decidedly did the same. "I used to hate any kind of food with cheese. Cal had eaten, like, a brick of it one night and threw it all up as I watched and it, like, traumatized me for years."

Charlie took a bite of the macaroni and, surprisingly, took the time to chew and swallow. "I should get you an apron as a gift and cement you into the hopeless lifestyle of a stay-at-home housewife."

"Literally the scariest thing you've ever said to me." I retracted my fork from the pot with a tiny serving of macaroni balancing on the utensil. "And that's including 'Kitten'." I put the fork in my mouth before it fell.

"I should bring that back. All the nicknames."

I violently stabbed my fork into the pot before he could. "Don't you dare."

"Maybe I can get you a maid outfit, too, Snowflake?"

"Don't try and implement me into one of your fantasies," I shoved the small fork into my mouth and mumbled, "I will, literally, make your life a living hell."

"Ooh, torture. That's kinky. Do we have a safeword?" He took another bite of the macaroni with his teeth bared.

I rolled my eyes and exhaled through my nostrils as I chewed.

"In all seriousness," Charlie chuckled, swallowing his food. "With you, every day is a fantasy. I've always dreamed about a relationship like this when I was young, no matter who it was with. I guess I got what I wanted."

I blushed, looking down at the counter. "Did you ever expect someone like me?"

"...I guess I expected someone who needed help." Charlie hesitated, placing his fork against the rim of the pot. "I... have this strange attraction to people who are hurt. I guess I just love to care and protect people who aren't me. It's some weird white knight syndrome that I have."

"...It makes sense." I set my fork down and rested my crossed arms on the counter. "You like to _care_. I like to be cared _for_. No wonder we got together."

"I can't believe it took us four years to realize that."

"Or maybe we always knew and we never wanted to admit it."

Charlie chuckled a little, filling the silence of the room. I brushed my fingers tenderly against my arms as I sat there, staring at the table, contemplating what I wanted to say next. I could hear the subtle buzzing of the overhead light above us, spotlighting the dining table only, our surroundings dark as if we were on a stage in a theatrical production. It almost made me feel claustrophobic.

It was a little too quiet at the moment. Charlie was too quiet.

  

_...Is now the right time?_

_Considering everything that Claire had said... what other chance would I get?_

_Now seems like the perfect opportunity._

  

_...But I'm scared._¬†

_And I have no idea why. I love Charlie, and I know he'll accept me, I know he will. So, why am I so afraid of telling him? Will it be his response that frightens me, or... something more?_

Charlie looked up at me, detecting that something was on my mind. Even without saying anything, I knew. _I_ knew that _he_ knew that _I_ knew that there was something I wanted to talk about. And I think he knew what it was, too.

_I mean, there's no way he doesn't suspect it... I've shown real, physical signs of it. He has to know... He has to..._

_He must know._

  

"...Charlie?" I spoke up, breaking the silence.¬†

Charlie, with his attention already hooked, leaned in, prepared for whatever I was about to announce.

_He does know..._

_I'm afraid, petrified... But, there's no turning back now._

"Can we talk about something?" I asked shyly, my eyes glued to the table, directed away from his face.

After a few seconds of silent hesitation, Charlie's soft voice echoed throughout the room.¬†

"...I know, Sky."

I picked my head up and faced him, a shiver being sent down my spine as if I had dropped down a 50-foot drop on a rollercoaster. "...You know?"

Charlie nodded. "I've... I've been doing a lot of thinking about us and... I'm done trying to hide from you, Sky. I want us to have a bond built on trust and loyalty. I want us to have the right relationship. So, I decided... I want you to read the letters."

  

_Oh..._

"O-Oh..." I stuttered, the anticipation built up in my gut being released immediately as if I had undone a strangling belt. "...The ones from your mother?"

"Yeah..." Charlie sighed, folding his hands and resting his elbows on the counter. "I know I said that I wanted this 'issue' to be _mine_ to handle _alone_, but... I've realized that I can't act like I'm in this on my own anymore. I can't pretend like I'm the one who's hurt. I can't keep playing victim, and I can't keep using that as an excuse to be cruel. You're my family, Sky. And this is a family matter. You deserve to be _just_ as involved in this as I am. If... you're willing to stand by my side..."

"Oh, Charlie..." I whimpered, reaching out and grabbing his hand from across the dining counter. My arm hit the pot in the process, knocking it to the side by an inch. "I would love to."

Charlie smiled, his hazel eyes displaying a raw shade of red in response to his emotions coming through.

I smiled back.

I'm happy for him.

  

_Someday, he'll know._

_Someday soon._

\~~~

It was like reading a novel.

Every letter that I analyzed, every word and hint or clue that could've revealed something, _anything_ about Charlie's mother... they felt like chapters in one long, drawn-out mystery book. A daring, authentic, bone-chilling anthology. My legs grew tired and uncomfortable after sitting with them crossed on the floor for so long. The story felt like it expanded across several years... because it did.

Letter after letter, reading between the margins, I knew Charlie's mother more and more without even knowing her name. She was fragile, but courageous with her actions. She was imperfect, but kind. She was regretful, but optimistic. She was hopeful. Hopeful that one day, she'd reunite with Charlie. Even after everything that happened, she was hopeful. But there was no address, no label, no signature. Nothing. On any of the blood-red envelopes. _Whoever she was, she was afraid._

_And that fear reminded me a lot of her son._

"Sky?" Charlie called from the bed behind me. "...Are you coming to bed?"

"...Give me a few more minutes," I requested, focusing my blurred eyesight on the cursive letters. It was late at night and my energy to commit was growing very fatigued.

"You've been reading them for an hour now..."

"You let me read them, so I'm reading them."

"Yeah, but... you've been _re-_reading them in order, like, several times. This is, like, your eighth cycle."

"I... I'm trying to find _some_ sort of clue that'll tell me where she is... I've been reading between the lines, trying to see if _something_ connects to something somewhere else..." I didn't exactly know what I was saying, but at least it _sounded_ intuitive.

"Sky, I've been trying to do that as well. For two weeks."

"We don't have the same perspective. People view art differently, right?"  

"Yeah, but this isn't art. It's letters. Words."

"I don't see it that way."

"It has _nothing_ to do with art."

"I always find a way..."

I could hear Charlie sigh with disappointment. "Maybe I shouldn't have... got your hopes up."

I turned my body around, looking up at Charlie from the carpeted floor, watching his head lie against the pillows with his head facing the ceiling. He seemed ashamed. "What do you mean?"

Charlie shook his head and rubbed his temples with irritation. "...I don't know what the point was. I didn't find anything, I don't see how you will."

"At least give me a chance."

"I am. But, it's almost midnight and you've been reading for the past hour."

"I'm onto something, I can feel it," I shrugged, trying to lighten the mood with a calmer tone of voice. "I can't make waste of this mindset I have going right now."

Charlie sat up and leaned forward, looking down at me on the floor, surrounded by the red envelopes scattered across the carpet in a circular pattern; almost like a strange seance. "Can't you pick it up tomorrow?"  

"Tomorrow is your birthday."

"Don't you want to sleep? Aren't you tired?"

"Yeah, but..." I exhaled deeply, my back sinking as I slouched over the written notes in my paws. "...I just didn't want to disappoint you on the night before your big day. I thought maybe this could've been my big present to you... Actual progress on the case..."

Charlie's face shifted to pity. "...Sky, I'm not asking you to be the answer to all my problems. I just want you to be by my side."

"I am, Charlie. And that's what I'm trying to do. I want to care for you as well."

Charlie sat up and slowly lifted himself off of the bed, his feet touching the carpet.¬†

"Skyler..."¬†

The husky sat onto the floor behind me and, without warning, snuggled me from behind, fastening his arms around my stomach and holding me dearly. He rested his chin on my shoulder and curled his legs around my own.¬†

"...I love you more than anything. But, I don't want you to make the same mistake I did. I put my own issues aside for you and that caused pain for both of us."

I turned my head in the direction of his voice, my cheek brushing up against his snout, feeling his fur against my face and his whiskers intertwining with my own. He pressed his nose into my shoulder and kissed my neck gently.

"This can wait until after tomorrow, okay? The letters aren't going anywhere," He pleaded quietly, his embrace growing tighter. "Let's just relax for my birthday. Me and you, all day..."

I felt myself begin to smile, although I tried to fight it. Charlie saw the break on the right side of my face and squeezed me tighter, making me blush. He then began to sway our bodies side to side comedically to cheer us both up.

"...Are you sure these are all the letters?" I asked once more.

"...Yeah, why?"

"I just wanted to make sure I cleared things up before putting it on pause."

Charlie went quiet.

"There is... one more."

"...Where?"

"In my briefcase... But, can we wait until after..?"

"...I just want to read it really quickly." I touched my paws against his, which were wrapped around my stomach. "Before I give in to your masterful persuasion."

Charlie sighed and scoffed, giving in to mine. He then loosened his grip around me. "Just skim through it quickly, alright? There's nothing important about it."

As Charlie left the hug, standing up and approaching his briefcase, I wondered aloud, "Why is it in your briefcase?"

Charlie grabbed the said briefcase from the corner of the room by the handle and unzipped it, reaching inside. "It's... my favorite letter out of all of them. My mom was recalling a memory that I hold close to heart, and... it just makes me emotional, that's all."

"Oh, are... are you sure you want me to read it?"

"Go ahead, Sky." Charlie walked back over to where I sat on the carpet, the significant red envelope in his hand, holding it out for me to take. It looked like every other one, reminding me of that same pointless mentality. There was likely nothing special about it.¬†

But, it was Charlie's favorite. And that I had to respect.

I grabbed the letter as I stood up from the floor, staring at the unripped fold of the envelope where it was previously sealed. Charlie stood back and watched as I turned around, reaching for the letter inside. Slipping it out of the paper envelope, I unfolded the triple-tucked sheet to find a catalog of many words amounting up to paragraphs, that in turn, amounted to a full letter. Possibly the longest letter out of all them. Maybe the deepest one, too.

I took a deep breath and began to read.

  

**_Hugo, this letter is more for Charlie._**

**_Hi, pumpkin! I don't have any other goal for this month's letter, I just wanted you to know how much I miss you._**

**_If my math is correct, you graduate sixth grade today! I'm so, so sorry that I'm not able to be there for you right now. I wish I could come back, but there's too much at risk. I know your father reads these and I know there's nothing I can do in order to talk with you again. I'm only writing this letter because, a few weeks ago, as I was walking home from church, I saw something on the way back._**

_**It reminded me of you, Charlie. It reminded me of that memory we had together, when I taught you how to ride that bike outside of your father's house. Well, I mean, not 'taught', but, you still rode that thing like a bird rides the wind. I was so proud of you. I wish I could've given you more memories like that. I'm so sorry I left you, Charles. If I could come back to get you, I would.**  
_

**_The thing I saw was a painting._**

**_It was of a boy and his mother riding down the streets of a blissful park on a bike. Every time I saw that painting, I teared up. It's become a natural habit now. Every Sunday, after church, I pass by to stop and stare at that painting. I stop and stare and I think of you, Charlie. I think of you and what I could've given you, other than a life without a mother to care for you._**

**_I'll find you. One day, I know I will._**

**_For now, stay strong, Charles._**

**_Love, Mom._**

  

I felt my entire body go cold.  

I froze right there on the spot, my hands rigid and still as if I had been turned to stone.¬†

The letter almost slipped out of my grasp.

My bones began to shake as a feeling of undeniable realization crept down my spine and shook me to my core.

  

_Can this be real?_

_Am I losing my mind or did I read it incorrectly?_

_Is this actually... real?_

  

_This letter._

_This painting._

_I've seen it before._

  

_I know where it is._

_I know that it's located near a church._

_I know that one of the members of that church has seen this painting, too._

_I know that this member has seen my work as well._

_I know that she found interest in me because of my portfolio, particularly one painting that resembled my boyfriend. One painting that reminded her of someone she used to know._

_I know that she commissioned me to paint a mural for this church._

_I know what she looks like._

_I know her name._

  

_I know who she is._

  

"Charlie..?" I whimpered delicately, unable to speak properly.

"What's up?" I heard him ask from behind me, unaware.

"...What is your mother's name?"

"Why?"

"Please, just tell me..."

  

"...Her name is Autumn."

  

I turned around and stared at him directly, horrified of what I'd just discovered, knowing that I, myself, met the woman that Charlie has been searching for, for the past few weeks, but¬†_longing_ for, for his _entire life_.¬†

_And I never... even... noticed._

Charlie sat on the edge of the bed, his arms crossed, naively unbothered. But then, he saw the look on my face. The terror in my eyes, as well as the hope. It took him a second to analyze the situation, but when he noticed that I had figured something out, he stood up from the bed slowly.

Slowly and carefully.

"...What happened, Sky?"

"...Charlie..." I could feel my eyes begin to well up with tears, the type I had tried so hard to fight off not so long ago.

Charlie held his hand out as if I had equipped myself with a weapon of some sort.¬†

"...What did you find, Skyler?"

"Charlie..." I inhaled shakily, unable to steady my breathing, my jaw left hanging open.

I held the letter in my trembling paws, a tear falling from my face and hitting the page.

"What, Sky?" I could see it in his eyes as well.¬†

_He knew that I'd found her. He knew it._¬†

_But he needed to hear me say it._

_To believe it._

  

"...I know where your mother is, Charlie."

  

Soon, Charlie would be at his knees, crying his eyes out in pure disbelief.¬†

And soon, I'd be the one holding him, whispering words of comfort into his ears.

But then, something else would be introduced.

Although we had aimed for only a subtle day of peace and intimacy the next day, our schedule had to be interrupted.

A new plan would be formed.¬†

We'd be spending Charlie's birthday differently than planned.

# 36. THE PAINTING

\~~~

## Charlie

_I was asleep, as I had been for a while now._

_As I had wanted to be forever._

_Asleep, coddled up into Skyler's arms, hidden away from the world and the dangerous things that inhabited it. I wanted to rest here, with him, until the end of time. His soft touch smothering me whole; his silky fur, his sweet scent, everything that made me feel safe surrounded me like a cozy sweater or a warm blanket on a cold, winter night._¬†

_I never wanted to leave._

_But, all things must reach an end. No matter how scared I am of the conclusion._

  

I could feel the gentle contact of Skyler's claw-less fingertips fondling the spaces behind my ears, slowly stealing me from sleep. I awoke, expecting to see the bright beams of daylight, only to be met with more darkness; apart from the neon glow of the digital clock on the bedside table. '4 AM', it read.

Suddenly, an orange glow flickered and illuminated the pitch-black bedroom in small sparks, the tiny snap of a lighter quietly blazing. I found myself suppressed into the pillows, unaware of what exactly was happening. I lifted myself from the cushions and turned around, finding the source of the orange glow.

My eyes landed on Skyler, who was lighting a candle with a pocket lighter, passing the flame and crowning a small cupcake. A vanilla muffin-sized treat with white frosting and colorful sprinkles.

There was a small, subtle smile on Skyler's face as I slowly adjusted to the setting of the burning flame, sitting upright and steadying myself on the bed. Skyler, rested on his knees, put the lighter down on the bedside table, and held the brightly-shining dessert in my direction.

"I'm sorry that your birthday plans got interrupted," Skyler whispered, keeping the atmosphere as calm as possible. "This is me making it up to you."

He gestured the candle towards me once more. I felt a smile creep onto my face as well.

_Last night ended with so many tears. I'm glad to be woken up with peace._

_Skyler told me everything last night about the woman he met during that one trip. He spilled every feature that he could possibly remember from that one encounter with her. He believes her to be my mother. Every detail he communicated miraculously lined up with the image I had of my mother when I was a child. They had the same name, the same looks, the same personality._

_Skyler had met my mother and never realized. And all I had to do was tell him who she was beforehand, and this all would've ended sooner. But, no. My reluctance to open up to him dragged things out in an excruciatingly painful way._

_But, it was no longer the time to mourn over my misdeeds. It was time to find my mother._

_It was time for me to see her again._

"...Whatever happens today, Charlie," Skyler looked me in the eyes, which glimmered brightly before the flame, "I love you, and I will never leave your side. Ever."

The heat of the burning candle brushed against my face. I stared down at the swaying patch of fire, igniting the wick poking out of the colorful wax.

_The sight felt too familiar._

_I was reminded of a time long before any of this happened._

_When I knew much less than I did now._

_When I didn't have Skyler. Or really anyone._¬†

_When I wasn't in the best place._

_But now, when I look around, I notice everything that I have now. Everything that I've gained. A house, a career, a place to rest, a love to keep me warm, a family to confide in. A life to live._

_I really did have everything. I can't believe I ever wanted more than what I did now._

_When I look at Skyler, I am content._¬†

_I have everything I've ever wanted._

  

_Twenty-four years of my life and I never realized it._

  

"Happy birthday, Charlie," Skyler spoke in the softest voice possible. "You made it."

_We_ made it.

I grabbed the cupcake and immediately set it aside on the bedside table, reaching my arms out for Skyler instead, my _true_ sign of how far I've gotten. Not even the biggest birthday cake could resemble my progress when compared to Skyler. I planted my mouth onto his and pulled him down into the bed with me. Skyler gasped from the sudden gesture, but accepted it with gratitude. We kissed gently and delicately. I held him tenderly, he hugged me gingerly.¬†

We did not make a sound, not a single noise.¬†

We only laid there together, our embrace stronger than any other.

_Whatever happens today... I won't care._

_Skyler will always be enough. And I will never want more._

\~~~

A few minutes later, we were out of bed and preparing for a journey. I hopped into the shower and scrubbed my body to death, drying myself off hastily with a towel. As Skyler took his turn, I brushed my teeth, swished mouthwash, flossed my gums, and washed my face, taking the right measures to assure myself of a defined and approachable appearance. I went into the closet as Skyler exited the shower, finding something nice to wear.

"Sky, when does the bus come?" I called from across the bedroom hallway between the closet and the bathroom, to which Skyler responded with, "At 5 AM. We have half-an-hour."

I breathed in and out, carefully and anxiously. I stared at myself in the vertical mirror in the closet, watching my reflection stare back.

I've never been one to loathe the way I looked, but this morning, nothing seemed to be right with me. I was a mess, my hair was a mess, my fur, my face, _everything_ about me was a _mess_.¬†

_How could I present myself this way to my mom?_

I felt my limbs begin to shake with fear. I looked back over at Skyler through the doorway of the bathroom. He was brushing his teeth. I held back the urge to run up to him and squeeze him to death for comfort.

I desperately scoured the many outfits, both mine and Skyler's, searching for something that would make my appearance more neat and tidy. I found the tuxedo from the dinner date and stole the clothing hangar from the rack, holding the suit up in front of my body to preview how it would look. _It looked like I was trying too hard to impress her._

_I'm meeting my mom, not my date._

I threw the suit on the floor and reached for something else, acquiring a black velvet blazer. _No, I would look like I was attending some sort of fashion event._ _I don't want to be overbearing, I just want to look nice._

_Fuck, why can't I just pick out something normal to wear?_

"Charlie?" Skyler called, knocking on the doorframe to the closet to announce his presence. He was cloaked in his robe. I only wore a towel around my waist. "You okay?"

I bit my lip and looked over at him, my foot tapping repeatedly against the floor with anguish. I clenched the metal wire of the clothing hangar, my paws tightening until I could see the bones of my knuckles visibly under my skin and fur.

I stared at the floor, not wanting to show Skyler my saddened eyes. "Sky, I... I don't know if I can do this."

Skyler came close, not letting any second pass. "Charlie..."

His paw touched my shoulder. It was fuzzy and warm. I felt my eyes begin to clog with tears.

"...What if she doesn't want to meet me?"

"What are you talking about, Charlie?" His other paw made contact with my back as Skyler pulled in closer. I continued to stare at the floor.

"She stopped sending the letters a year ago... What if she gave up? What if she wants to forget me?" A single tear slowly rolled down my cheek.

"That's not true, Charlie."

"How do you know?" I turned my head up to his, looking down at the sympathetic feline standing by my side, as he'd always done.

"...I _don't_ know." Skyler reached up and pressed his paws to my cheeks, using his thumbs to wipe away my tears as they fell relentlessly. "I don't know what will happen, Charlie. But, what I _do_ know, is that if you don't do this, you'll regret never taking the opportunity while it lasted."

With devastating emotion, I sunk my head lower into his arms, allowing Skyler to pull me into another embrace of solace. I collapsed my face onto his shoulder, bending my back over his tiny figure as he wrapped his thin arms around me, brushing his fingers against my spine.

"I'm not saying that to scare you, babe, but I _need_ you to know," Skyler whispered into my ear as he stroked my back, "You _will_ regret it, Charlie. If you don't do this, you will. I'm saying this now because I know that _I'll_ regret it if I never warned you. So, please, let's do this, okay? No matter the outcome, you'll at least have clarity."

I nodded my head, sniffling and retracting from his body. I rubbed my reddened eyes and looked back into the mirror. "D-Do you know what I can wear?"

"Hmm..." Skyler analyzed my reflection, turning around and scanning the room as I had done earlier. He reached into the wardrobe and pulled out a plain white polo with black corduroy slacks. He also acquired a tie and tossed it over his shoulder, handing me the articles of clothing. "It's simple, but not careless. You'll look fine, Charlie."

He touched my shoulder attentively, giving me the assurance I needed. He returned to the bathroom to freshen himself up as I began to change into the clothing.

As I had gotten to the final asset of the outfit, the tie, suddenly, I heard a distant knock at the front door.

_...What the hell?_

_Who could be at our house at this time of night?_

I turned my head back over to Sky, who slowly inched his over to mine. Though we were separated between rooms, the clear-as-day guilt on his face gave away the fact that he knew who was at the door.

"Sky, who's at the door?"

Skyler paused for a second, his face going pale.

He set down the blow dryer in his hand and took a deep breath, approaching me with ease. "...You have to promise not to be mad at me."

"...Who's at the door, Sky?"

"...I-It was a last-minute decision I made last night when you fell asleep, I don't know if it was the right one, but, please, Charlie, just listen to what I have to say first‚Äî"

"Sky, just tell me who's at the door‚Äî"

Skyler grabbed me lightly by the shoulders in an attempt to calm me down. "...Look, you were telling me how you've been starting to understand that you aren't alone in this anymore, right? That this was a... a _family_ matter?"

I felt my heart sink.

"Sky, please don't tell me that you..." I slowly backed away, covering my mouth with my paws. Skyler looked at me with worry in his eyes, regretting his decisions. He held his hands close to his chest as he feared the worst would come.

"I... I didn't think it through, I... I'm sorry, Charlie, I thought it was the right choice..."

"Why..? What made you think that..?"

"...If _I_ deserve to be a part of this, _he_ should too."

Without him even saying _his_ name, I instantly knew who Skyler was referring to. My doubts were proven to be correct, much to my disliking.¬†

"Charlie, he wants to fix things, this could be the perfect opportunity..."

I knew I couldn't be angry at Sky for it.¬†

I knew I couldn't be angry at all.¬†

Because he was right.

  

Abruptly, I passed by Skyler, exiting the bedroom. I could hear the soft pitter-pattering of his feet follow close behind as I ventured towards the entrance to the house. Entering the main hall, I approached the front door and grabbed the doorknob.

Without a single moment of hesitation, I opened the door and faced the man on our porch.

  

My father stood there, holding his paws together politely, an expression of shame and embarrassment painting his face.

I stared at him for a good few seconds, figuring out what exactly I wanted to say.

"...Charlie‚Äî" Hugo started, his head slowly rising to meet my level.

"‚ÄîAre you going to help us find her?" I interrupted, formerly and direct. Skyler stood behind me, examining our interaction closely, bracing himself for whatever was about to happen.

Hugo stared at me, unsure of what to say.

"Are you _going_ to help us _find_ my mother?" I repeated with a more stern attitude.

"...Y-Yes‚Äî" Hugo attempted, caught off guard by my sudden interrogation.

"Then come in. And don't do _anything_. Don't even say a word." I raised my finger up to his face intimidatingly, declaring that I was the one in charge.¬†

_Hugo was no longer the man of the house. He was now in mine._

I spun around and stormed right back into the bedroom, leaving Hugo and Skyler at the door. I could hear a quiet apology from Sky as he chased after me. I returned to the closet, whipping the tie back out and attempting to fasten it around the collar of my polo. Sky stopped at the door of the closet, keeping his distance.

"...Charlie, he's trying."

I didn't take my eyes off of the mirror. The tie wasn't working the way I wanted it to. _God, when was the last time I wore a tie? Why is it so hard to wear it properly?_

"...I'm sorry I invited him without your permission. But, I knew you wouldn't say yes‚Äî"

"‚ÄîYou were right, I wouldn't have, so why did you invite him?" I kept fumbling with the tie. I tightened the knot up to my collar, realizing that it looked crooked. With annoyance, I yanked the tie from my neck, redoing it.

"He deserves to see her again, too."

"I'm sorry, how?" I looked at Skyler, channeling my anger. I've been learning how to contain myself more and not freak out all the time. I guess it was working. "He hurt my mom, he lied to me, he‚Äî"

"‚ÄîHe wants to change. He's trying, Charlie, but you won't let him."

"I waited all my life for him to change!" I snatched the tie from my collar once more, unhappy with the way it looked. "I'm sorry that I have trust issues, okay? But, that man is a _fucking_ _monster_. He lied and he hurt me."

"Didn't you do the same to me?"

I felt my limbs freeze in the middle of another attempt at the tie. The sight of my reflection staring back at me began to sour.

"And I gave you forgiveness, no?" Skyler continued, taking a single step into the closet. "Charlie, all your life, you've only ever complained about your father. But, that spiteful hatred turned you into him! You said that yourself. What will it take for you to accept that _your_ grief is just as heavy as his?"

I couldn't bear to hear it. I knew it was true.

I slowly resumed the process of adjusting the tie, which failed once again. I ripped it from my neck with fury.

"Hugo fell in love with your mother, you fell in love with me," Skyler continued as I re-attempted the tie, growing angrier with every endeavor. "The more you hold this grudge against him, the more likely it is _we'll_ end the same way your parents did. All it takes is _forgiveness_, Charlie. Forgiveness and _change_."

"_Fuck_, how the _fuck_ do you _tie_ a fucking _tie?!"_ I growled, clenching my fists down on the ends of the fabric and holding it to my forehead, suppressing a nonexistent migraine.

"You think I know?! _I'm gay as fuck!"_ Skyler hissed in response, stepping away from me.

"I know!" Hugo had suddenly entered the room, cowardly and intrusively. He looked at the both of us as we stared blankly back at him and his abrupt arrival, suddenly regretful to reveal he was eavesdropping. "I know‚ÄîI, uh‚ÄîI know how to tie a tie, Charlie."

I gawked at him, unable to say a word. The same went for Skyler.

My father stood there awkwardly, the unusual silence making the three of us tense.

Skyler looked at Hugo, then back at me, then back at Hugo. He then shook his head and reached for something to change into from the multiple hangars, departing from the closet and entering the bathroom. He shut the door on us prominently, leaving Hugo and me alone. Together.

My father stared at the floor, then up at me.

I looked away. Then down at the tie. Then up at him.

Hugo sighed. He reached his hand out for the tie.

I sighed. I gave it to him.

"Let's see..." Hugo cleared his throat, putting the tie around his own neck and fastening it himself. "I'm doing it on me first just so I can remember..."

When he was finished, it looked perfectly straight. Dad had appeared to be defined and approachable.

"Alright, here," he exhaled, untying it from his neck and reaching for my own. He looked at the collar of my polo and paused. "Charlie, you have to... You have to lift the flap."

He reached for the flap of my collar, attempting to lift it for me. "I-I can do it myself, Dad‚Äî" I swatted his hands away and grabbed the ends of the collar, flipping them upward.¬†

Hugo nodded his head with another repetitive sigh, proceeding with the asset. He reached the tie around the collar of my neck and brought the two ends down in front of my chest. He folded one end around the other, pulling it up through the loop of the tie, and inserting it into a small opening between the wrapped silk. He pulled the sharp end down and tightened the knot, fastening it all the way up to my neck. Finally, Hugo lowered the collar flap down over it and turned my body towards the mirror.

It looked perfect.

I saw myself, my attire and everything, standing there proudly, with my father close behind, his hands rested on my shoulders.

_It was a sight I never thought I'd see in my life._

_A drowning sense of despair coursed through me, weighing down my blood._¬†

_I felt heavier, for some strange reason._

_My lungs felt so heavy._

We both had gone quiet for a few seconds. My father opened his mouth slightly, presumably to say something. I didn't try to stop him.

"...You look good, kid."

My eyes never shifted from the mirror and our reflection.

"...Thanks."

  

The bathroom door opened and Skyler had emerged, dressed and all ready to go. "Bus arrives in fifteen minutes. We have to get going."

"Okay," Hugo and I said in unison.

\~~~

The three of us left the house soon after that.¬†

I felt the cold break of air smack me across the face once we'd hit the concrete. Four to five AM was always such a peculiar time of day, not ever fitting in one specific category. It was neither night nor morning. It was a period that seemed to exist between _life_ itself; a liminal space in time that felt unreal or false. It was the 'after of after', following the events of the previous day, while preceding the events of what was to come by the next day.¬†

On foot, we ventured down the sloped hill, finding ourselves back at the Greyhound bus stop, the one Skyler and I visited when he left for his first commission. There was barely any light in the sky this time around. The galaxy above us soared high and shined brightly, the stars looking down on us like bugs under their shoes. I felt so minuscule beneath their glow.¬†

_Such a large planet, yet, such a small world._¬†

_Only chance could've led to this. I don't see any other explanation._

_Or was it fate?_

_Meeting Skyler, an artist, who just so happened to publish a painting of me on his website that was noticed by a lost mother who had been separated from her own family. Was it all meant to be?_¬†

_Was Sky always the reason? That everything would come together in the end?_

_...Or would it even?_

The three of us bought our tickets in the bleak, abandoned waiting room and stepped outside, reaching the sidewalk, lit merely by a flickering lamppost. We all stood in silence, listening to the howling midnight wind as it swept between us, waiting for our oncoming bus in the dead of night. A deserted atmosphere.¬†

We had to get up much earlier than anticipated in order to make it to Sacramento before today's Sunday church service was over. It would be a long drive, but we had to get there. This might be our only chance.

Skyler and I had planned it all the night before. He had to assure me, repeatedly, that we'd find her in order to quell me of my hysterical fit. We concocted our procedure to visit my mother's church service by morning, as it was the only location Skyler knew she would be, time and place. It was a gamble, but one I was willing to take.

The bus had arrived and the three of us boarded the empty Greyhound. Skyler and I sat in a two-seat aisle, beside one another. Sky got the window seat. Hugo hesitantly sat in the aisle directly ahead of us, not knowing where he belonged. My eyes watched the back of his head, glaring with mistrust, though, I didn't feel like being angry with him anymore. I didn't _want_ to anymore. I was sick of it.

With a metallic hiss and a sudden lurch, the bus was set into motion, and soon, we would be far from home. I exhaled deeply with relief, leaning my head back down on the headrest of the cushioned chair, prepared for another long and endless ride. It was best that we slept now, making up for the hours of sleep we'd likely miss out on.

Skyler pulled out his headphones and plugged the wire into his phone. He put one of the earbuds into his right ear and held the other one out for me. I accepted his offer, placing the shared bud in my left ear. Sky then played his main music playlist on shuffle, inserting the phone back into his pocket. I watched him as he did so. He then looked back up at me with a kindred gleam in his eyes and a slight smile that comforted my nerves.

"I should have asked," he whispered, referring to the man in front of us. "I'm sorry, Charlie."

"Don't be," I told him. "I forgive you, Skyler."

I wrapped my arm around the kitten as he scooted himself closer into my chest, leaning his head down on my shoulder. I didn't dare to look away until I was one-hundred-percent sure he was out cold and safe in my grasp. Skyler began to drift right back into sleep as if nothing had come between it.

Knowing he was protected, my eyes wandered back over to Hugo, whose head was slightly turned, his gaze set on me. I stared back, not afraid of him. After a few seconds of silent eye contact, Hugo turned back around and faced the front, leaving me and Skyler alone.

Once I knew for a fact that we had our privacy, I closed my eyes and returned to my solemn sleep, my hand clasped desperately onto Skyler's shoulder.¬†

_I never want to let go._

\~~~

"Charlie..!" A drowned-out voice called, the feeling of two paws on my shoulders slowly fading into touch.¬†

The moment my eyelids had cracked even a sliver of the way open, I was immediately blinded by a shining, glaring light. It even stung a little. As my limbs tensed up at my sides, holding my paws out in front of my face to block the shine, I had realized that the source of the light was coming from the windows. The sun had risen in the sky, and the bus was stationary.¬†

"Charlie!" I heard Skyler hiss pressingly, his paws shaking me gently. He was no longer resting in the seat to the left of me, instead, standing in the middle aisle of the bus with Hugo, ready to go.

I sucked in the surrounding air, instantly filling my lungs and giving myself a jolt to wake my body and mind up. Skyler held his paw out for me, urging, "Come on, we're going to be late!"

Instinctively, I grabbed Sky's hand and rose to my feet. The bus had accumulated some new passengers, but we were the only ones getting off. Still hazy from the sudden awakening, I followed Skyler blindly as the two of us and Hugo made our way to the front of the bus, escaping it.

We hopped onto the sidewalk, sending a blistering pain through the soles of my shoes as my limbs were still half-asleep. The sun felt hot and I could hear the ambience of a busy neighborhood around me. Before I could even get a chance to view my surroundings, Skyler immediately ran off in a random direction. "Fuck, it's a few minutes past 12! We missed the service!" He worried, beckoning Hugo and me to follow.

"Where are we going, Sky?" Hugo called out, trying to understand the rules of the location we were in currently. Skyler paused and spun around, catching his breath, but not for long.

"I think I know where the church is, I haven't been here in a month, though," Skyler fretted, shaking his paws anxiously at a distance. "But, if we move now, we might be able to make it, so COME ON!"  

Hugo and I glanced at one another, deciding that, in Skyler, we had to trust. He was the only one that's actually been in this town before. We broke off after him, following his directions.

As we raced in pursuit of the blue and pink feline, I took a second to analyze the town we had found ourselves in. It was _exactly_ how I had pictured it after reading the letters and making personal assumptions. Sacramento fit the exact description. I don't know how I didn't realize it sooner.

I began to notice things about the town that showed up constantly in her letters. Motifs and themes were all displayed in this exact location.¬†_A secluded, suburban-urban neighborhood. A town with city-like amenities. Small shops and corner stores lined up and down the street. Pedestrians making their way about, strolling up and down the pavement._

It was an out of body experience, being in the town after reading about it for so long. It was like stepping into a virtual world, one that you've been raring to visit. It met all of my expectations.

_My mother made it her home. She was welcomed into it like a home._

_And now, I was in her home, too._

_Somewhere in this town, she was here._

_I didn't know how close, I didn't know how far._

_But she was here. Somewhere._

_Not yet visible._

_But here._

  

_Is this really it?_

_Has my mother been residing here the whole time?_

_I feel too afraid to understand it..._

_All my life, she's been here and I never knew._

_She's been right here._

  

I saw my father running beside me. Skyler running just ahead of us. The three of us, running together.

Two separated fragments of my dysfunctional family were right in front of me, working together alongside me. For me. Skyler, the love of my life, and Hugo, my father.

There was only one more role to fill. And she would be found soon enough.

As we ran, I couldn't stop thinking.

_I've built up so much hatred in my life... I've built up so much hatred inside of me._

_I've been so angry, so tough, so scary, to the people around me, and to the people I love... all my life._

_Why, now, am I the most scared I've ever been?_

  

_I'm afraid of seeing her._

_I'm afraid of what she'll say, how she'll react._

_Mostly, I'm afraid of my mother showing her emotions._

_I'm afraid that she'll cry in front of me, and I won't know what to do since I never really knew her. I wouldn't know how to comfort her, I wouldn't know what to say, I wouldn't know how to react._

_I'm so afraid that, when I see her, we won't be miraculously bonded back into a family relationship as if the past several years never happened._

_I've been so set on finding her, I never even considered what the consequences would be._

  

_Do I even want to find her anymore?_

  

"Charlie, are you okay?" I heard my father call out, noticing that I was starting to lack in comparison to the two of them, falling behind. He turned around on his heels, slowing to a stop. Skyler, farther ahead, noticed and stopped as well.

I caught up to him, my feet skidding across the cement sidewalk. I leaned over, resting my paws on my knees, catching my breath.¬†

"Son, what's wrong?" Hugo asked, concerned.

I stared at the concrete, not saying a word.

_I..._

_How do I talk to my mother if I can't even talk to my own father?_

_I have to make things right._

_No more anger, Charlie._¬†

_No more._

"...I'm scared, Dad," I confessed, squeezing my eyes shut. I spit out the saliva lingering in my mouth onto the pavement. I pressed my hand against my forehead, rubbing my temples with my pointer finger and thumb. "I... I'm scared..."

Hugo was quiet for a few seconds.

_He's never really had the chance to father me before._

_He doesn't know how to comfort me. Exactly how I imagined the situation to go if we really did find my mother._

Despite my beliefs, Hugo took a step closer and leaned down onto his knee. Skyler stood there in the distance, watching.

"...I'm scared, too, Charlie," Hugo expressed, placing his paw on my shoulder.¬†

My eyelids slowly parted ways. I tilted my head up at him just an inch; not fully showing him my face as I was afraid to give into confiding in my father... _but something inside of me wanted to so badly._

_I don't want to be angry anymore._

_I don't want to be sad anymore._

_I'm tired of being mad, being scary, tough, hurt..._

_I just want to have parents again._

_I just want to be the son of loving parents, one more time._¬†¬†

"I'm scared to see her again," Hugo admitted emotionally, his deep, raspy voice breaking only a little. "I messed up, and... and she had to pay the price for my mistakes. And you did, too." He couldn't bear to look at me, seemingly ashamed of the life he's been living.¬†

My eyes began to water when I saw the expression on my father's face.

It's been so long since I've seen an emotion from him, other than anger.

"I don't know if she'll ever look me in the eyes again, but..." Hugo glanced up in my direction, the redness of his eyes beaming in the morning sunlight.¬†"What I _do_ know is, I _can't_ walk away from this again. I _have_ to find her... so _you_ can see her again. I'm done making the same mistakes, Charlie. As a father, I have to put my children first. I have to do this for _you."_

_God, I..._

_Being loved by Skyler was one of the best feelings in the world._

_Being loved by friends, too._

_But, to be loved by family..._

_I never realized how much I needed it._

  

Fuck needing it, I _want_ it.

And there's nothing wrong with that.

  

I reached my paw out to Hugo.

"C'mon, Dad," I stated, tears left dwindling in my eyes. "Let's find Mom."

With thankfulness, my father put his hand in mine.

We both started back up, racing over to Skyler.

As we approached him, I reached out and grabbed his hand in the process.

"Let's go!" He yelled, and we all followed his lead once again.

  

We passed by buildings, homes, stores, trees, cars, poles, people. We took several turns and detours. Skyler wasn't the best at navigating his way, but like a dog, when he sensed a familiar path, he followed it.

The second we had passed by one last building, in the distance, we saw a church at the end of the block. It stood tall and mighty, bricks met firmly between tough cement, the cross at the tip of the steeple scraping the glimmer of the sun in half. Hundreds of people were exiting the building from the front doors. The service had ended not too long ago.

Skyler, Hugo, and I all looked at one another.

After years of feeling so much pain and suffering, there was finally a light at the end of the dark tunnel. A hope that things would be okay.

Yearning for the end of it, we all dashed in the church's direction, in search of the final destination.

After the crossing of a few streets and sidewalks, soon, we would be in the middle of an entire congregation, swarming around us like an ocean of people. We had made it onto the wide, populated, front courtyard of the church, our shoes hitting the checkered cement patio. The main double wooden doors of the church and front steps leading into the entrance were _just_ ahead... but _just_ out of reach.

Skyler attempted to push through the crowd to enter the building, but the waves of people kept crashing down in defense. More people were shoving by every second. Hugo and I tried to keep up, but for once, Skyler's small size and quick agility had bested us canines.

I watched as he grabbed a random person by the shoulders ahead in the crowd, giving up on trying to reach the church. It was a younger, 30's-looking lynx that seemed to be an everyday churchgoer, evident by the formal attire. Hugo and I kept pushing past people to reach him.

"Do you know Autumn Wingrave?" Skyler questioned the man frantically, who was a little freaked out by the sudden intrusion. "She's a part of the church, please, do you know her?"

Hugo and I had stumbled our way over to Skyler's side when the man replied, "Y-Yes, I know Autumn, w-why?"

"Do you know where she is?" Hugo took over the interrogation, stepping in closer.

"I-I don't know, I-I think she was heading home when I last saw her, uh..." The man desperately tried to think, touching his fingers to his forehead. "T-Today was her last day as the youth group director‚Äîwe had a whole send-off for her and everything during the service."

"Fuck, that's right," Skyler cursed, facepalming with frustration.

"...What is he talking about?" I asked Skyler apprehensively, my gut sinking.

"Who even are you people?" The lynx questioned with aimless purpose. "Do you know Autumn?"

"Sky, _what is he talking about?"_¬†I questioned him once again, fiercer.

"Sh-She said that... she would be moving by next month when I last saw her," Skyler stuttered, embarrassed or even ashamed to admit he had forgotten such an important detail. "That was a month ago..."

"Autumn isn't a part of the church anymore?" Hugo asked the man intensely.

"No! Like I said, today was her last day!" The man raised his voice, starting to get fed up with our interaction. "We said goodbye and everything!"

"...No, no, fuck!" I gasped, taking a few steps back.

"When does she move?" Hugo prodded continuously.

"She leaves town with her family tomorrow!"

"No, fuck, no..." I exasperated, backing away from them.

Skyler turned around and faced me, remorse growing inside of him. "Charlie, wait‚Äî"

The interaction came to an end once I had bumped into a random person, causing me to stumble and almost collapse. Skyler and Hugo both reached for me at the same time, worried out of their minds. I felt my entire nervous system set off like a system of alarms, blaring wildly, every fiber in my body being sent into a panic. I jumped up from the ground, running in the opposite direction, causing a commotion in the crowd.

"Charlie!" Skyler and Hugo called out after me.

Stricken with overwhelming hysteria, I shoved my way out of the congregation, escaping from the sea of churchgoers and residing at the end of the sidewalk. I fell onto my knees, landing safely in a small patch of grass.

In the grass, a single sunflower sprouted from the bright green.

Such vibrant, happy colors aiding me at such a hopeless, devastating moment in my life.

_Was that it?_

_Was that our last chance, blown?_¬†

_Fuck! Could things have gone differently? Could I have waken up earlier on the bus? Maybe if I hadn't had shared that moment with my father, we could've made it. Fuck, I don't know..._

_Fuck!_

_FUCK!_

  

"Charlie, hey!" Skyler whimpered, landing on his knees beside me and touching his soft paws to my face. His fingers brushed along the shape of my jawline as he turned my head up in his direction. Sky knew the exact tactics to calm me down. "I'm so sorry, Charlie..."

"We can't give up, guys, we can't..." Hugo muttered, walking around in little circles next to us. "We can't! There has to be something..."

"We'll find out someway, _someone's_ got to know where she lives, right? Before tomorrow?"

"What are we going to do, ask every single fucking person if they know where _Autumn Wingrave_ lives?" I argued, losing hope.

"We'll ask every single person if we have to, Charlie!" Skyler exhorted.

"No... no, it won't work..." I was reduced to even more tears. I never knew how much I could produce. They were all waiting for this moment, stored away for the past several years. "We won't find her, we... We won't..."

"Charlie, don't give up..." My father spoke sincerely from the left side of me, reaching down and resting his paw on my shoulder. Skyler had no input on my right.

"I can't... I can't do this anymore, I..." I stared down at the sunflower in the grass, a single tear hitting one of its pedals.¬†

_I can't do this anymore..._

_Getting my hopes up just to be let down, over and over and over..._

  

"...Skyler, what is it?" Hugo asked, averting my attention.

Curiously turning my head to the right, I noticed that Skyler was visibly deep into thought. His brows were furrowed and his face had gone pale.

It took a few seconds for the idea in his head to buffer properly, but when it did...

  

"The painting..." Skyler mumbled softly.

As the two simple words processed in my head, Skyler grabbed onto my shoulder with wide, frantic eyes, raring to get back on foot.

"THE PAINTING!" Skyler¬†screamed out at the top of his lungs.¬†

The next objective was set. And there was no time to lose.

Before Hugo and I could react, Sky hopped up onto his feet, stumbling backwards and struggling to hold his balance. Once he was steady, he immediately ran in the other direction, darting across the street ahead of the sidewalk we rested at. A few cars honked, almost hitting him.

"SKYLER!" I yelled out, my entire protective system over-activating in the case of losing him, pushing up from the ground and tripping as I leaped off of the floor. I ran in pursuit as Hugo followed, struggling to keep up.

The two of us sprinted through the busy intersection, dodging cars left and right. There was no prior thinking to this decision, all I had known in this moment was to get to the other side. The cars barely existed as an obstacle in my mind.

Hugo and I reached the sidewalk, safe and unharmed, just like Skyler. With arms opened wide, I latched onto Skyler and held him close. "Don't fucking run into the street, Sky!"

"The painting, Charlie!" Skyler reasoned, grabbing onto my chest. "She visits the painting every Sunday on her walk home from church! That's what she told me!"

"That's what the letters said, too," Hugo added his input, keeping up.

"Where the fuck is the painting, then?" I pressed eagerly, grasping Skyler by the shoulders.

"I... I-It's gotta be around here, somewhere!" Skyler stammered, unable to remember the exact geographic locations of every building in a town he visited _once_¬†over a month ago. "It's a part of an outside exhibit for an art museum, th-there's a whole wall displaying several paintings‚Äîthe one she looked at is at the very end of the block‚Äî"

"‚ÄîWhere is the art museum, Sky‚Äî?!"

"‚ÄîI don't FUCKING KNOW!"¬†

"Hey, do you know where the art museum is?" Hugo sounded further than we'd seen him last.

Skyler and I looked over in the direction of his voice, seeing that he was asking a random woman on the block, a few feet away.

"Art museum?" The women wondered, an older, larger, and rounded black feline. She appeared less freaked out in comparison to the lynx, possibly because Hugo approached her with ease and gentleness.

"Yeah, I don't know the name, do you ever recall there being an art museum here in town? Are you local?"

"Oh, yeah!" The woman snapped her fingers and pointed to the sky.¬†"The one with the outside painting exhibit?"

"YES!" Skyler and I both abruptly shouted, running up to the two of them.

The woman, now frightened by our intrusion, began to give us directions with a confused look on her face. "...So, it's a few blocks down that way, about three or so," she kindly informed us, crossing her arm out and pointing her finger in the direction of our right, "and then you take a left and it _should_ be right there."

"‚ÄîTHANK YOU!" The three of us all exclaimed in unison before she could carry on, making a break for it down the block in the direction she pointed to. We left the confused woman to her own devices, running for what could possibly be the final stretch.

We ran and ran.¬†

I don't think any of us had ever run as fast as we did then. We were almost Olympic-state-champion-level worthy. The summer heat was high, sweat dripped down our faces, our limbs flailed back and forth with every patch of concrete we leaped over, our surroundings blazed past us like a breeze.¬†

Life almost felt like it was in slow motion.

This would be it. The home run.

Skyler. Hugo. Me.¬†

We ran like our lives depended on it.

One block passed, two blocks, then three.

We all coursed a hard left.

We had followed the woman's directions.  

And here we were.

  

There was no museum. No wall of paintings.

The fire inside of me died out once again.

  

Skyler and Hugo, not accepting the defeat, journeyed forward, hoping to find it somewhere close by.

I staggered behind.

The two in front of me continued to worry and fret, discussing options and what to do next. Hugo urged Skyler to remember. Skyler whimpered and whined, losing his sense of direction.¬†

I slowed down.

A distance grew between me and the others.¬†

Their chaotic voices began to blur out of my mind.

My feet grew heavy and tired.

I was done with running.

They kept racing forward towards the end of the block, refusing to give up.

They passed the street and continued onto the next block, calling for me to follow.

Walking at a steady pace, I reached the crosswalk, but I didn't go forward.

I stopped in my tracks and stared up at the sky.

Birds flew overhead, swimming through an endless blue pond, decorated with fluffy clouds and blocked narrowly by tree branches above my head.

The sun beamed down on me.

I wiped the sweat from my forehead and closed my eyes.

A slight ringing infested my ears.

I felt a cool breeze wash over me, bringing relief to my overheated temple of a body.

I turned around, facing away from Skyler and Hugo, opening my eyes.¬†

I looked at the buildings around me.

I saw careless pedestrians, making their way through the town.

I watched a few leaves as they fell from perfectly healthy trees.

I heard the rumble of rubber tires as cars passed by at a slow speed.

I could hear my own breath, slowly getting calmer and calmer.

I breathed in, I breathed out.

_I'm done._

  

I looked over to my left.

I stared down the intersection, between the building I stood by and the next, viewing the next few streets down.

From the opposite side of the block, across the street, I saw a white, fluffy tail disappear behind the corner.

The tail belonged to a body that adorned a dress patterned with sunflowers.

I didn't see the face.

  

Looking up at the building across the street, I realized that Skyler and Hugo were on the sidewalk that stood on the backside of the art museum.

They were calling my name, unaware of where they stood.¬†

So close to the destination.

If I hadn't have noticed, we could've missed it entirely.

I crossed the street, over to where Skyler and Hugo were, but before I could join them, I took a hard right.

I started forward down the side of the block, almost reaching the corner.¬†

But then, I stopped cold.¬†

I stopped before I could pass by the edge of the building.

Because I knew that if I turned the corner, I would see a woman at the end of the block, staring at a painting.

If I turned this corner, I would see Mom.

  

Skyler and Hugo came up beside me.

I spun around and stopped them from coming any further.

They both looked into my eyes, wondering what the situation was.

I gave them a certain stare back, telling them clearly what lay ahead.

They both understood and straightened up.

Hugo closed his eyes and lowered his head. He knew his purpose here was done.

Skyler shifted his brows downwards and held his paws together. He knew that it was all up to me now.

I was too scared to move.  

I cast my afraid, horrified eyes down on Skyler, wanting him so desperately to comfort me and guide me towards the corner. I was so scared of doing it alone.

I wanted so badly to run back into his arms and let someone, anyone, other than _me_, finish the deed.

But Skyler knew that I was on my own now.

And I knew it as well.

I had to face this myself.

It was all in my hands, now.

¬†  

Sky nodded his head, a tiny smile left on his face.

He opened his mouth.

"Go."

  

With tears rolling down my cheeks, I nodded and obeyed.

I turned around and wiped my fur clean.

I brushed down my shirt and fixed up my tie.

I sifted my fingers through the hair on my head, adjusting it properly.

I took a deep breath.

  

_Go._

  

I stepped forward.

The sun hit me as I walked onto the opposite side of the block.

I dreaded looking. I was so afraid of how I'd feel when I see her.

But, enough was enough.

I turned left.

  

In the distance, all the way at the end of the block, stood the blurred image of a female canine.

The woman had pure white fur and adorned a bright, vibrant, sunflower dress.¬†

She was facing the wall of the building, staring at whatever was being displayed.

I couldn't see her face that clearly.

  

Contently inserting my paws into my pockets with a sigh, I strolled on forward.

I didn't stop. I kept walking down the block at a normal, relaxed momentum, as if it were just another day.¬†

As if I had lived in this neighborhood.¬†

As if it were my home, if I did make the fatal decision to leave with my mother.

The paintings in glass frames passed by, one by one, as I traveled further down the sidewalk.

Some were beautiful. Some were abstract. Some were realistic.¬†

All of them, art.

The image of the woman grew closer.

The image of the woman grew clearer. With every step.

A man on a bike passed by in the street quietly.

Another bird flew over my head.

More leaves fell to the ground.

A toddler giggled with her parents on the sidewalk across the street.

The sun kept shining through the trees, leading the way for me.

I could hear the subtle noise of the leaves all swaying in the wind, rubbing against one other, twisting and entwining with other sticks and branches.

The woman's dress fluttered in the breeze.

Her side profile was now in full view.

She was gorgeous. Enamoring, like a historic painting.

Her mouth stood still, stagnant; but her eyes... They had a clear smile in them.

Her ears were pointed high up to the sky.

Her tail wagged slowly.

Her arms were left to drift at her sides.

She didn't move.

She just kept staring at the painting.

  

I was now right next to her.

  

I stood by her side.

I looked at the painting, right beside my own mother. For the first time in several years.

I never thought I'd get the chance again.

  

Subtly, in a delicate and understated manner, she glanced over at me for a second and immediately looked back at the painting.

Another tiny smile formed on her face as she didn't want to make a stranger like me uncomfortable. I did the same, giving Autumn her own personal space.

We both admired the painting together, without a word spoken between us.

Even as strangers, the moment was comforting. Just two random people, respecting the silence. Respecting each other's anonymity. Sharing a brief period of time as two living, breathing, people. Admiring one, unique, simple painting.

The boy on the bike, the mother pushing him.

The happiness and joy that melted off of the page.

A moment in time, never forgotten.

  

_And finally, I found my courage._

  

"It's a beautiful painting," I broke the silence.

The woman paused for a few seconds before responding.

"It really is."

_Her voice sounded the same._

_Every memory_¬†_of her_¬†_that I attempted to savor had come back._

_I was so afraid of losing them._

_But now, I could make more._

"It's..." I tried my best to formulate the right words, analyzing the painting. "It's like a..."

"...A moment trapped in time," she finished my sentence.

"Yeah, exactly."

The woman chuckled softly.

"It's my favorite painting in the world," she professed, taking in the sight of it. The colors, the hues, the texture of the materials, the faces, the emotion. "I just _had_ to stay around a little later than usual. This might be my last time seeing it, ever."

"Really?"

"Yeah, I'm... moving out of town tomorrow, as crazy as it sounds," she nodded her head, happy to keep a stranger company.

"Why don't you take a picture? To remember it?" I wondered, looking at her.

The pleasant expression on her face showed just how much she loved and cared for the painting. How much it meant to her.

"...Sometimes, I... just like to let art be art."

I exhaled sharply with a hint of laughter. "You sound a lot like someone I know."

"...You do, too, is that weird?"

She turned her head and looked at me, face to face.

Our eyes met.

We were only inches apart now.

_I could finally see her in full._

_She didn't change. Not one bit._

_The features of her face were still the exact same; defined, slim, young, and utterly beautiful. My father fell in love with her for a reason._

I could see a visible shift in her facial expression.

"...You look like them, too," she mumbled to herself.

  

That was when I couldn't handle it anymore.

  

I stopped talking.

The woman stared at me, still, as a stranger.

_But, then, a glimmer of familiarity._

I watched as the features of her face began to alter.

Her smile began to fade.

Her eyes began to widen.

  

Her expression soon changed from pleasant to completely blank.

Autumn examined me, every inch of my face, trying to figure something out.

She knew something was wrong.

She didn't know what, though.

I still did not say a word.

I watched as her face changed from completely blank to suddenly afraid.

Her eyebrows tilted downward as her eyes began to bulge.

Her forehead began to wrinkle as her appearance crumbled, piece by piece.

Her jaw, bit by bit, started to lower.

Her teeth started to show.

I still did not say a single word.

My eyes watered once again.

Autumn stared at me as if she was afraid.

She looked like she'd seen a ghost. A terrifying one. Yet, she couldn't take her eyes off of me.

She held back so much fear and devastation.

It was as if behind her face, she was screaming and crying.

The same was happening to me.

A single tear fell down my cheek.

Her eyes watered along with mine.

I bit my lip and inhaled through my nostrils.

I was terrified.

Autumn was terrified.

We were _both_ terrified.

But, we were _together_.

  

"...Am I dreaming right now?" She asked, plain and simple, her voice high-pitched and on the brink of cracking.

I wanted to say 'no', or shake my head, or do fucking _anything_ to relieve her doubts... but I couldn't move.

"Please..." She whispered, her breath shaky and her face frozen with horror. "...Please, tell me you're just a stranger and I'm only a creepy woman that's freaking you out..."

I missed it when, even in the darkest of moments, my mother still had her sense of humor.

I wanted to move so badly, but I couldn't.

"Please... tell me I don't know you."

I couldn't move.

"Please..."

I did not move.

  

"Oh, my God..." She exhaled, slowly inching closer towards me. "Oh, my _God..."_

I was trembling. My mouth opened. Nothing came out.

"M..." was all I could say. "I..."

"Oh... Oh, God..." Autumn kept trembling.¬†

Her quivering paws reached up slowly.

I wanted to feel her paws against my fur so badly.

"M... M..." My body twitched and wavered.

"Oh, _God..."_ Autumn said so quietly and incoherently that I could barely understand what she was saying.

Her paws came closer.

"M..."

I saw the pain in her eyes.

The pain and the relief.

The _overbearing_ relief.

  

_She had finally found her son._

_I had finally found my mother._

_We had found each other._

  

Her paws were particles from my face.

Contact was atoms apart.

  

"Mom..." I spoke.

  

With a loud gasp, my mother touched my face and began to cry.

Tears poured down from my eyes as the feeling of her hands against my cheeks finally brought my aching soul peace.

I was home.

"Charlie..."

"Mom..."

"Charles..."

"Mommy," I cried, a waterfall of tears gushing down my cheeks as I reached out for my mom, giving in and not holding back.

My mother and I threw our hands around each other. The grip of our limbs tightened, ensnaring one another within our embrace. My mother's head rested between my shoulder and my neck, the touch of her fur against mine, setting my spirit to rest. She still smelled like she used to, a sweet mix of lavender and honey. I soaked it all up in one fatal embrace, holding on tightly to the woman that's been apart from me for far too long.

I've been searching for this feeling my entire life.

My mother was happy.

I was happy.

I was happy and I was loved.

By Skyler, my friends, my family.

My parents.

  

I held onto my mother and didn't dare to let go.

I didn't think I ever would.

  

_I want to stay here forever._

_I never want to leave._

_I want to stay here until the end of time._

_I never want to lose this feeling._

_I never want to lose love._

_Never._

  

# 37. LEAVE IT TO THE WORLD

\~~~

## Charlie

I've been resting within the embrace of my mother for a few minutes or so now.

But, it's felt like hours.

In those few, measly little compact groups of sixty, quick seconds we call time, my world had changed. Physically, mentally, emotionally; I felt so much more different.

My head was slammed and clutched tightly against my mother's shoulders, lying deep within the crevice between her neck, my arms fastened tightly around her like a belt. She hugged me back with the same amount of force, locking me in and trapping me endearingly.

I missed the way her fur felt. Soft like the feathers of an angel's wings, and surprisingly, the cotton material of her sunflower-patterned dress also felt familiar to the touch. I don't know how I could possibly remember the way someone from my childhood felt, or smelled, or looked... but everything about Autumn was exactly how I imagined her to be. She was the same. _Mom was the same._

It was like reconnecting with a physical memory you never knew existed. And being able to reclaim it allowed you to realize that it always did. Just in the back of your head.

My memories of her are faded and barely vivid, but reuniting with Autumn sparked so much nostalgia. She used to be taller than me, by a lot. I was a short, hyperactive toddler. Now, I'm an inch taller than her, a full-grown adult. It's crazy how much has changed since my eighth birthday. The gap between today and the last moments I ever had with her, all those years ago, were long and drawn out, but quick and forgettable at the same time. Life had rushed by without me noticing it.

  

The embrace had started off with so many tears. Then, as the fleeting minutes of our passionate hug passed by, the mood grew calmer and warmer. My nerves eased into a state of tranquility, so much that they began to feel numb and fuzzy. My breathing had slowed, leaving my throat and lips dry. The tears that stained my face had slowly withered away. My rapid heartbeat was now steady. I was able to feel calm again.

_For the first time in what felt like so, so long, I was calm._

  

"...Is this some sort of miracle?" I heard a light, fragile whisper plead for clarity. "...Am I imagining things?"

Again, I was at a loss for words. The soft sniffling that came from the right side of my face had proved to me that my mother knew who I was, yet remained unconvinced.

"...They tell me to have faith..." She continued, the tone of her voice painting an image of her sorrowful expression in my head. "...But, I don't think I've ever lacked it as much as I do now..."

I wanted to pull back and look at her, show her that it was me, Charlie, her son, but I couldn't let go of her. And I couldn't speak. I just wanted to stay here and soak up the feeling of her embrace forever. It was the paradise I've longed for my whole life.

"...God is playing tricks on me..." She whimpered, unable to keep herself from crying. She just kept trampling over her words, swiftly pulling her hand away from my torso to wipe her face before putting it right back around me. "...H-How is harder to believe in you, being here, than it is to believe in Him?"

"It's me, Mom," I mewled, a smile forming across my face. My voice was just as broken as hers. "I swear, God isn't playing tricks on you, I'm right here, I... It's Charlie. _Your_ Charlie."

"...How do I trust that this isn't all in my head?" She whispered once more, unable to talk to me face to face. We never pulled away from the hug. "...I'm sorry, I... I lack faith," she cried, so badly that she couldn't even speak. She just kept weeping and sobbing, her hold over me dwindling.

"Mom, it's me..." I held tighter, not wanting her to let go.

"How can it be you?!" She wailed breathlessly, her entire body shaking and trembling. "_How_ is it _you?!"_

"It's okay," I told her as she began to slip out of my grasp. "It's okay, Mom."

"It's not," she bawled, shedding even more tears, "I... It's not possible, I... _I betrayed you!"_

"Mom, you didn't‚Äî"

"I left you! _I left you!"_ I could hear the agonizing pain in her cries. It began to make my heart ache horribly. "I left you..!"

She slowly shrunk, falling to her knees. I hastily dropped to the concrete with her, catching my mother as she cried into my chest, collapsing and breaking down in my arms. "Mom‚Äî!"

"I left you..." I couldn't even understand her anymore. All I could hear was the mumbling. The suppressed and hopeless suffering. She crumbled in my arms like a sandcastle hit with a heavy wave. "I left my son..!"

"I'm here now!" I consoled, squeezing her tightly. "Mom, I'm here! I'm here!"

"How? Prove it!" She sobbed, attempting to situate herself, but making no ground. She just kept hiding her tear-drenched face, having no control over her limbs. She touched my shoulders and my chest as if she was unsure I was real.

"Do you know what today is, Mom?" I asked her, gently clasping her wrist and holding the back of her head for comfort. Her red, swollen eyes met mine and I could see all the hurt in them. The remorse and the guilt. "Today, Mom. What is today?"

"...The day I left..." She admitted, regretfully. "...Your birthday..."

"Do you know how old I am, now, Mom?"

"...Twenty-four years old..." She answered correctly with almost no hesitation. She's known all this time. "...You're twenty-four..."

"Yeah, Mom..." A tear ran down my cheek as my heartfelt smile grew wider. "You're right."

My mother closed her eyes, wiping her face with the palms of her hands. As she gently brushed her paws against her fur, it came to me how much I'd forgotten the way she looked. The last time I ever talked to her was when I was 8. As I've said before, I barely remember anything other than a few blurry images.¬†

But, now, with Autumn directly in front of me, my mind seemed to have finally clicked. Every faded image was clear now. Her thin and defined facial structure, the small patch of gray fur around her eyes, and the dark tear stains marking down her cheeks; all of it was still there.

I saw myself in her. After all, I did inherit half of her breed. It was like staring at a female counterpart of myself. A doppelg√§nger.

She was real. So _fucking_ real that it was almost horrifying. _Horrifyingly beautiful._ Autumn was always such a gorgeous sight to me, even as a kid. She had that appearance of a mother, one that would always soothe and vanquish the fears of a frightened little kid. A mother that you'd trust and rely on. The leading figure of a family.

But, when that figure, the one you looked up to throughout your childhood, becomes the frightened one... things change. You have to be that figure now. You have to be the leader of the family.

"It'll be okay, Mom," I comforted her sweetly, brushing my paw tendely against her hair. "I found you... We're together now... That's all that matters... We're together..."

_It felt good to say Mom again._

"I missed you... so much..." she uttered below her shaky breath, "...I missed you, Charlie, I _missed_ you..."

"...I missed you, too."

_...What do I even say to her right now?_

_Do I tell her about how I found her?_

_Do I keep comforting her?_

_Do I tell her about me? My life? Or do I ask about hers?_

_Do I tell her about Hugo's lie that I believed for almost sixteen years of my life?_  
  
  

_I never thought I'd make it this far._  
  
  

That was when I noticed my mother's eyes had shifted to something behind me, and suddenly, they had widened with devastating fear.¬†

Like a bomb had gone off inside of her, she jumped away from me, breaking off our embrace and leaving me, desperately needy for her touch again.

Stumbling back, she rose to her feet and began to step backward with caution, horror and uncontrollable terror in her face as she held her arms out, defending herself from whatever was closing in behind me. I was too shocked and dismayed by her reaction to look.

"...Autumn," I heard the voice of my father close behind.

I turned around and sat up from the concrete, setting my sights on Hugo. He stood a few feet away, shame and embarrassment slathering his face, his hands raised slightly in the air as if to prove he meant no harm.

I felt the tension rise. I turned my head back over to Autumn, who was still, ever-so-slightly, backing up to eventually flee the scene.¬†

I couldn't have my mother running away the moment I found her after years without her. But, she looked _terrified_. It's one thing to see your mother sobbing, but to see her _scared..._¬†it's a whole new level.

Here I was, caught between my parents once again; my mother to my left, afraid and timid, and my father to my right, ashamed and nervous. I had the despairing need to grab both of their hands and join them together, but I knew, after everything, it was impossible. My parents would never join hands ever again, no matter how badly I wanted it. The feeling was all too familiar. I've lived it once before.

"Dad, what are you doing‚Äî?" I attempted at getting him to stay back for the sake of my mother, but Hugo had other plans.

"Autumn," Hugo called out, holding his paws out in front of him now.

"Char-Charlie‚Äî" Autumn's terrorized eyes connected with mine. It felt as though I had betrayed her, bringing someone, she so desperately tried to escape from, back into her life without warning. It felt awful.

"Dad, don't‚Äî!" I warned, practically begging him to give us space, but he continued.

"Autumn, listen, please!" He pleaded, holding his hands together. There was fear in his eyes as well. _He didn't want to hurt her. But Autumn believed otherwise._

"Hugo! STOP!" I growled, extending my arm out in his direction.

"Hugo‚Äî!" A smaller voice came from behind him.

Skyler ran up to Hugo's side and attempted to get him to turn away. Hugo looked down at him and backed up from the small cat, his focus set on Autumn.

"Skyler‚Äî?!" Autumn questioned with blaring confusion, all the chaos freaking her out. It must've been like an ambush to her, shocking new occurences jabbing at my mother, left, right, and center. I felt so, so awful.

"Hugo, Sky, please, stop‚Äî!" I begged frantically, the fear of scaring my mother off sending me into a panic. She looked as though she was on the brink of making a run for it.

"Hugo! Come on!" Sky whimpered, grabbing Hugo's paw and tugging at it feebily.

"WAIT! Please!" Hugo cried out, loud enough to concern nearby bystanders. He flailed his limbs as he yelled, scaring Skyler into retreating with reluctance. Autumn closed her eyes, frozen with fright. She knew the sound of Hugo's yelling all too well. I felt my body tense up at the sound of my father shouting as well, bad memories coming to mind.

"Autumn," my father began to tear up. My mother opened her eyes, close to breaking down due to an anxiety attack. _Whatever Hugo had to say, he cannot fuck it up._

_Please, Dad..._

_Do not fuck this up..._

_Please._

"Autumn, _I fucked up!"_ He confessed, lowering his arms to his sides with defeat. I could hear the emotion in his words. I never thought such a low and grizzly voice could have a whine to it. It was like he was on the edge of crying.

"I... Autumn, I... I fucked everything up. It was all my fault, all of it, everything that happened... It was all me, and I'm _sorry_. Autumn, I'm so sorry..."

I watched as a few tears fell from his face as he shook his head slowly with mortification.

Autumn was also crying silently, unable to move her face.

Tears just kept streaming down. For the both of them. It was uncontrollable.

"...I failed as a father. I failed as a husband. My one job, my _one_ job, was to protect... and teach... and love... And I was unable to do _any_ of that. That was _my_ fault, Autumn. And you and Charlie had to pay the price."

Hugo glanced over at me, suffering from the realization of everything he's done to me when I was a child. I could see it all in the way he looked at me. He knew he had fucked me up, and he knew he had to own up for it.

"I hurt you, Autumn. In more ways than one. I was a frustrated, ignorant man and I took out my unhappiness on you and our son... and I hurt, and I lied, and I failed _both_ of you. I abused you when I was supposed to show you love. I made you feel scared and small and unsafe... and it was all my fault. Autumn, you... When we fell in love, I was in a dark place. When I first had you, I was happy, and you fell in love with that happiness. But as we grew closer, you began to find my darkness. And I became defensive, so I tried to ward you off, and I ended up hurting you. And our son."

Autumn squeezed her eyes shut once again, her entire face crippled with agony and torment.

"...I hurt you so much that I scared you into running away. And you almost took Charlie, too, but of course, I grew defensive and I kept him from going with you. Even after you were gone, I still kept him from you. I lied to him about you, I hid your existence from him, he never read the letters, I... I abused him and made him feel afraid, I... _I ruined our son!"_ Hugo's voice shriveled and shattered into smithereens, the disgrace he had for himself completely taking over. "...I let my anger control me and I hurt everyone around me, everyone that had the chance to love me, and I ruined all of it, I ruined... I..."

He was now choking on his words. His face was a slobbery mess of tears and snot. My mother was almost the same. Skyler was teary-eyed, watching from the sidelines. I saw it all happen in front of me, not knowing how to react.

_Everything Hugo was saying... I never knew it was something I needed to hear._

"But, I know I can't have your forgiveness," he suppressed his howling with relentless tears, getting down onto his knees, "And that's okay. Autumn, I don't want your forgiveness, I'm not worthy of it, I, just... I wanted you to know that... _I wanted you to know that it was never your fault."_

Autumn opened her eyes slowly.

"...In those letters you wrote, you expressed so much grief for leaving... and it upset me, because... this was _never_ your fault. You didn't do this, Autumn, you're not the villain here. Even if you feel regret for running away, this was _never your fault..._ It was all _me_. _I_ was the reason this all happened, it was _never_ you. So, please, please, _please_, don't apologize, _please_, don't feel regret, and _please_, _do not_ blame yourself. You did _nothing_ wrong. It was all _me."_

Autumn was now staring at the floor.

It was the closure she's always longed for.¬†

Ever since she ran, those letters were proof of how much she regretted leaving the two of us on our own. She would never know if things ended well for me or Hugo, she would never know if we were okay, if something had happened to us, if we had changed. She would never know, and that haunted her for so long. It was evident in the way she wrote the letters. And it was evident now.

Autumn wept, not in fear or in pain... but with _relief._

_A sixteen-year-old roaring question had finally been answered. We were okay. For the most part._

She crouched down, hugging her knees with her left arm and cradling her forehead with her right. Every now and then, she covered her mouth with her paw, placing it back and forth from her lips to her forehead. She tried to stabilize her thoughts. It wasn't getting any better.

"Charlie..." I heard Hugo speak.

I turned my head in his direction, taking my eyes off of Autumn.

  

"...It was never your fault, either," He told me, clear and precise.  
  
  

_'It was never your fault, either.'_

_The words kept echoing in my mind._

_I had blamed myself for so much._

_My mother running. My father's abuse._

_I blamed it all on myself because I always believed that I was the main reason my parents were still together, even after all the fighting. The only reason they stayed married was because of me, until everything changed. I saw it as my responsibility. I saw their relationship as something only I could fix. Something that only I had the power over._

_But, that was never true._

_It was never my fault._

_I wasn't the one responsible. I wasn't the one who had to take responsibility._

_And I still don't have to._

_I don't always have to be the one held accountable for things._

_I don't always have to be the one who's strong and protective._

_I don't always have to be the one who cares._

_I can be cared for._

_I can be vulnerable and protected._

_I can be the one who's not responsible for everyone and everything all because I believe that I'm the glue that keeps things together._

_I'm not. And I have to learn that it's not always my responsibility._

_It was never my fault..._  
  
  

_It was never my fault._  
  
  

I stood there, between my father and my mother, realizing all this in just a matter of seconds.

And everything came crashing down.

I began to cry. My entire face grew damp and soggy with all the fresh tears that spilled down from my clogging eyes, making my vision go blurry.

I opened my mouth, moaning and whimpering like an injured husky. I felt as though a giant hole had been ripped out of my stomach and all I could do was cry.

And, for the first time, it felt good to cry.

But, that feeling only came when I suddenly felt the arms of two adults, one from my left side and one from my right, completely submerge me into their embrace.

Autumn Wingrave and Hugo Cooperton had noticed that their son was in pain. And, like any other expected set of 'normal' parents would do, despite their troubled relationship, there was only one thing that mattered the most to the two of them: their child.

They both grabbed me and hugged me as if their lives depended on it.

The moment I felt their hands on me, I gave in to vulnerability. I gave into protection. I gave into being cared for.

I collapsed into their arms, allowing them to hold me close. Allowing them to love me as parents, no matter who they were to each other. Because that was never my responsibility. The only thing that mattered was how they loved _me_.¬†

And they did. And that was all I would ever need.

_Family._

As I lowered my head into their shoulders, resting in their embrace as they squeezed me both tightly, I opened my eyes. Skyler stood watching from afar, a subtle, emotional smile left plastered on his face.

With my right arm, I feebily reached out for him.

At a steady, non-intruding pace, Skyler walked forward.

Once he was close enough, he raised his paw and took my hand, holding it gently.

Even if he wasn't a part of the embrace, he was a crucial part of my family. And he always would be.

_This is where my responsibility resides._

_My responsibility to Skyler is to be caring,_¬†_to be honest,_¬†_to be vulnerable._

_My responsibility to Skyler is to be loving._  

_But, mostly, my responsibility to Skyler is to treat them as someone who has responsibilities as well._

_I guess that really is the point of love. Accepting someone's dark side along with their light, only if they have the responsibility to handle it themselves._

\~~~

When the mood had slowly grown more relaxed, Autumn had unexpectedly drifted into a state of forgiveness, even if she hadn't explicitly said it yet. She had shown it instead.

With my mother's permission, we followed her on the walk back home. Autumn had her own place here in Sacramento, her own 'family'. I didn't know what I would find or how I would feel about it when we got there, but I had to remain vigilant, no matter what, or who, manifested her home.

During the stroll through the pleasant neighborhood, between me and my parents, it was a little quiet. Skyler was then able to tell Autumn about how this all came to be: how her tiny little commission had caused the reunion of long-lost, dysfunctional family members. That was when I was able to see some amusement on my mother's face after a morning full of tears. From what I heard about the original visit, Autumn was very keen on Skyler, and this basically proved it. Autumn knew Skyler had a boyfriend, she just didn't expect it to be me. Of course, she didn't.

Funnily enough, Autumn was very pleased to know that Skyler was my special other. She hadn't reached the phase of being a proud parent yet, as we've spent several years apart, but I could tell she was happy about our relationship. The same went for Hugo.

I was always so jealous that Skyler could have two, present, loving parents that accepted both him and his relationship with me. Now that _I_ have that acceptance, I have no idea how to feel.

"How is Charlie?" Autumn whispered awkwardly to Skyler, the two of them a little further ahead on the sidewalk. My tall, pointy ears were able to pick up every word, though. My father and I walked side by side, still a little stunned by today's events. It was hard to even fathom the image in front of me: my mother walking alongside Skyler, talking like close friends.

"The best person I've had the pleasure of meeting," Skyler whispered back to Autumn.

"He's a good guy?" Autumn giggled with relief, wiping her eyes.

"They don't get any better than him, trust me," Skyler smiled.

"...Does he love you?" Autumn wondered, staring ahead with a bit of hesitance.

"...We love each other, yeah," Skyler answered, taking a quick peek over his shoulder to look at me. "Even if things get difficult, we love each other." There was a heartfelt grin on his face that transferred onto mine. _We do love each other. I don't know how I ever had the ability to hurt him. He's the love of my life._  

"...What about him and his father?"

"...They're still working things out. But, it's better now than it has been for a while."

"...Does he... Do you think he could love me?"  

"...He always has, Autumn." Skyler grabbed her hand. "It'll just take him some time to show that love to you."

Autumn nodded her head with a deep exhale, accepting Skyler's response.

  

After a few more blocks, we came upon a smaller, moderate-looking suburban home. The sun, breaking through the cloudless sky, shone down on the faded, dusty blue paint that coated the outer walls and reflected off of the slanted, gable roof, tiled with asphalt shingles. It was short and modest on all sides, surrounded by concrete and small patches of rocks, layering over plains of dirt, as well as a small driveway with an old, mangy car parked near the fence. Next to the car were several taped boxes, set along the drive and stacked in advance.¬†

From the small number of packed-up containers and the destitute appearance of the shoddy household, Autumn must not have had a lot in her life. When she first came here, she had little to nothing. But, she was able to turn that nothing into something. And already, even if her house wasn't as luxurious as our childhood home, she was happier here, as proven in the letters. Little can go a long way when you're safe.

Here we were, just outside of Autumn's house, basking in the hot sun on the sidewalk. Autumn turned to face the three of us timidly, still keeping her distance from Hugo. Even if some of the conflict had been resolved, there was no way you could just forget several years of trauma. Skyler would know.

"Um..." She hesitated awkwardly, rubbing her paws together with unsureness. "...This is it."

Me, Hugo, and Skyler stood there on the concrete, quiet and dreadfully waiting for something to happen. We hadn't planned what to do when we'd gotten to this point.

_Were we going inside?_

_Would I have to meet anyone I don't know?_¬†

"...Can I come inside?" I asked apprehensively, nervously pointing at the front door. It stood elevated, atop a short, white, wooden porch with a tiny staircase, a small overhead roof sticking out from the top of the house, providing shade for the terrace.¬†

Autumn looked back at the door and paused to think it over. Something was obviously keeping her from letting us all in.

_Was she afraid of Hugo or something more?_

She turned her head back around and, with reluctance, spoke, "...I'd have to tell my husband."

_...I almost forgot that she was remarried._ _I don't know if that means I have a stepfather, considering that I've never met him or knew he existed..._ _And even though she's entitled to her own decisions, it's still a little shocking._

_But, I can't be the one to make any opinions. She was barely in my life and I was barely in hers. Although we've had a frightening past, we were still strangers, almost. And I can't judge a stranger._

_It makes me sad to call my mother a stranger, but there's no way around it._

_What's done is done. All that matters now is what comes next._

"Okay..." I accepted, allowing Autumn to dissipate from the three of us with little confidence.¬†

_Things were still very tense and insecure between us all. It almost broke my heart, but I couldn't let it ruin the reunion._

_I guess I just wanted one conversation with her. One conversation so I could know things about her. Because, right now, I knew nothing._

_I wanted to know who my mother was again._

She disappeared into the house, leaving the three of us out on the sidewalk, unsure what to do. I looked over my shoulder, directing my attention to Hugo, who was staring at the concrete with subtle frustration.¬†

_The idea that Autumn had found someone that made her happy seemed to upset him. Because he couldn't be that to her._

_He longed for a redo. I could tell._

_But, there was no altering the past._

_We're stuck with what we have now, whether it's our fault or someone else's._

_...God, he really was just like me._

I almost jumped at the touch of Skyler's paws against my back.¬†

Startled, I looked down at him as the kitten snuggled up to my side, hugging me profusely. He gazed up into my eyes, his beautiful pink pupils settling my nerves. I could always count on him to be my stress relief drug.¬†

Skyler's hug was his own way of comforting me, telling me that it would be okay.¬†

_Don't worry, Charlie. It'll all work out._

_I don't know how, but you'll figure it out._

I reached down and hugged him back, sinking into his embrace. My paws caressed his back as I squeezed my eyes shut, soaking up the feeling of my familiar friend. Every time new ground was made in my life, it would always feel so good to return to Skyler afterward.¬†

_After everything, he was always there. Whenever I needed him._¬†

Not a word was spoken between us during the hug. There was no need.

Autumn came back out of the house, Skyler and I pulling apart in reaction. She watched us from the porch, emotion in her eyes. A tiny grin crawled onto her face.¬†

She was happy that, even though I didn't have the comfort of parents for most of my life, I had Skyler. And if that made me happy, it made her happy.

Holding her paw out, she motioned for us all to come in.

I stepped forward as Autumn refrained back into the house, following in pursuit. Once I had approached the first step of the staircase, I turned my head around and noticed that Hugo and Sky were not joining me.

"Are you guys coming?" I asked, my foot still planted firmly on the first stair.

Skyler and Hugo looked at each other for a moment, sharing a collaborative thought with one another. They had decided that it was no longer their place.

"You can go without me, Charlie," Hugo granted me permission, contently standing with his hands in his pockets. "I served my purpose."

Hugo knew that there was no point in coming with. He had already done what he had set out to do. There was no longer a need for his presence. I respected his choice to abstain.

I turned my attention over to Skyler, standing right beside my father. "...Sky?"

"...I'll stay out here, Charlie," he told me, holding his paws together. "...I think I'm gonna call my parents, anyway. I haven't talked to them in a while."

I wanted to reassure them that it was alright to accompany me, but I think the only reason I wanted their company... _was because I was too scared to go on my own._

But, Skyler and Hugo knew it was better that way.

So, I nodded sharply and went up the steps.

Entering the house through the front door, I found myself in a tight, empty living space. All that had occupied the room was only a rough, gritty carpet draping the floors, and dust floating through the air, illuminated by the rays of sunlight that came through the windows.¬†The bleak wallpaper adorned dust stains from what I could only guess to be picture frames that were left hanging for some time, now stripped from the walls.

I seemed to be in a living room, little specific imprints in the carpet left from now absent furniture, spelling out what the room used to look like. A couch, a coffee table, a counter that could've displayed a TV. Ahead, I could see into another desolate room across from me, separated by a hallway that stood between the two distinct spaces.

The door shut behind me. Autumn stood there, in the corner of the 'living room', anxiously waiting for my input. I looked around, seeing what life could've been lived here. This must've been my mother's house ever since she had run away here. Although it was little, it was home to her.

"...Is this where you've always been?" I wondered aloud, making eye contact with her.

She nodded carefully, that same subtle smile showing. She was happy to have me home, no matter the consequences.

"I... I've always dreamed of this moment, Charlie," Autumn faltered, holding her paws behind her back. "...I never thought the day would actually come..."

I wanted to respond, but that was when I heard footsteps.

Out from the hallway emerged another older man, one that was about my mother's age. He came out, hurriedly brushing down his clothes as if he had just changed in another room, frantically preparing to dress nicely in order to give off a good impression. Whoever this man was, he wanted to meet me.

Fixing up his shirt, he looked up and faced me, caught off guard. I don't think he expected me to come in yet. Autumn looked over at the man with anticipation as if they'd planned this in advance.

_What is going on?_

"Ch-Charlie, right?" He assumed, holding his hand out for me.

_Autumn's husband._

He was a tall, burly deer with brown fur and a composed figure. He had antlers that twisted and branched off in different directions, large enough that they almost touched the ceiling. I don't know how he could live in such a small house, considering how big he was, but he made it work.¬†

He looked like a businessman, or someone professional, for that matter. He wore a white polo, black leather slacks with a silver belt, and a tie hung around his neck, a little messy. He probably rushed. That, or, he just didn't know how to tie a tie.

His facial expression, despite his intimidating build, was kind and welcoming. His hand was still extended out for mine, waiting for contact. After noticing that I had been staring for too long, I reached forward and shook it, uneasily.

_It felt so strange, being in a place I didn't belong in. It felt even stranger when Autumn and her husband acted like I always did._

"How... How do you know who I am?"

The deer then paused, laughing awkwardly and scratching the back of his neck, looking over at Autumn. She nodded her head forward with a smile, giving him the courage to keep talking. She was excited for me to meet him. I was, sort of, on the fence.

"Uh, I... I, sort of, know all about you, Charlie," the deer spoke, fumbling with his hands. His words sounded rehearsed, like he had memorized lines for a play, but was slipping over the exact dialogue to say. "E-Ever since I met your mother, when she first came to our town... I was just one of the many people that helped her through everything she was dealing with, so... she told me everything about you."

I didn't exactly know how to feel. He was no Hugo, that's for sure. And I don't know if that was a good or bad thing.

But, things felt as though they were moving too quickly. I wanted to talk with _Autumn_, not her husband.

"Uh..." I staggered, indecisive on what to say.¬†

_I mean, what could I say? This whole thing was just randomly forced upon me without warning. There was nothing I could do, other than just go along with it._

"...Your mother and I, we... We've always talked about this moment, Autumn finally getting to reunite with you, me finally getting to meet you, but..." He cleared his throat. It was as if this had been a speech in the making for several years. "...we never imagined it to come so soon, I guess... I-I, for sure, didn't expect it to be today, of all days, but, I've always prepared for this and what I'd say to you‚Äî"

"‚ÄîYou told him everything about me?" I asked my mother, wanting her to have a voice in this conversation. _This was almost a little too much for me. This felt like a premeditated sabotage. I just wanted to talk with my mom._¬†"This whole time, you've... How come you never came back?"

Autumn, with her arms crossed, appeared conflicted once again. "...Charlie, look..."

"...We wanted to, Charlie‚Äî" The deer attempted again.

"‚ÄîMom, can I speak to you, alone?"

Her head perked up with discomfort.

"O-Of course, of course," the deer stuttered defensively, standing back. It was evident that he was nervous about meeting me. He acted like I was a rare celebrity.

_He seemed like a nice guy, but I don't know if I'm ready to know him yet._

_I still don't even know my own mother._

"...Charlie," Autumn took a step towards me as the deer left the room. Once he was fully out of sight, Autumn rested her paw on my shoulder and closed in. "...That was Lou, my husband."

"...He seems fine," I spoke, not sure how to react.

"...I met him when I first came here, and... he helped me with everything." Autumn spoke her next words carefully as if she was on thin ice; one wrong move and I'd be offended. I wasn't offended at all, just a little under pressure. I honestly can't imagine how _she_ feels about the situation. "And, long after that, we... fell in love, and... I started my family, here."

"Your family..?" I whispered to myself.

"But, as we fell in love, all I ever could think about was you... and how you'd feel... I was scared that you'd be mad at me," she said with a slight chuckle, lightening the mood, "but, I knew that I'd never be able to know, and that... hurt me... because knowing that you were mad would be so much better than not knowing at all..."

Autumn briefly wiped her finger against her eye, clearing an oncoming tear. I could see how much it meant to her, to finally be with me again after so long. The way she attempted at keeping a smile through all the tears demonstrated how grateful she was to stand beside me, and how painful it was to live without me.

"As time went by, I started to focus on my life, here, more..."

"...So, you stopped writing letters?"

Autumn's eyes shifted around as she bit her lip. Her face must've been aching from all the strain she'd been putting on it. I haven't seen her eyebrows lift from that doubtful, wavering state _once_.

"Charlie... it's more complicated than you think..."

"How come you never came back?" I confronted her, releasing all the burning questions that I had fiercly anticipated to ask. "You knew I graduated, why didn't you search for me when I was on my own?"

"Charlie, it's... _complicated!"_

"_Why?_ Can you explain it to me?" I pressed my hands down onto her shoulders. She stared at my paws as I did so, in disbelief of how big and strong I had grown since she last saw me. "...I want to know about you, Mom, I want to know about your life‚Äî"

"‚ÄîYou can, and you are!" Autumn grabbed onto my paws, squeezing them with care. I felt as though I was not being listened to, instead, merely silenced for my need for clarity. "Lou has been a _huge_ part of it, I want you to meet him‚Äî"

"‚ÄîI want to talk to _you_ about your life, _only_, not Lou. I want to talk to _you_."

"We _are_ talking!"

"Can we go somewhere private?"

"Charlie, I should be... _packing_ right now, I leave tomorrow‚Äî!"

"‚ÄîI come back into your life after sixteen years, and _that's_ all you have to say?!" I hissed, making sure to keep my voice down.

"Charlie‚Äî!"

Suddenly, our small argument had been silenced by the sound of a baby crying, down the hallway.

Autumn spun around on her feet instantly, the noise activating her motherly instincts. I felt my gut sink when I came to terms with the realization. Lou had re-emerged from the hallway, a tiny little fawn crying hysterically in his arms. "I-I'm so sorry to interrupt, A-Autumn, what do I do‚Äî?"

"‚ÄîHere, give him to me," Autumn raced over to her husband's side, reaching out carefully for the child.

"Are you‚ÄîAre you sure?" Lou fretted, seemingly panicked.¬†

"Yes, I'm sure, it's okay," she guaranteed with a soothing tone, gesturing for the baby.

I could see the anxiety in the way Lou held the child. _He was a worried husband, desperately trying to fill the role of a father._

I watched as Lou passed the baby from his arms to hers with extreme precision and care, trying not to do accidentally do something wrong. When Autumn took the baby, Lou stepped back and sighed deeply with relief, planting his hands onto the back of his head.

I could read him like a book. He seemed insecure. _Lou wanted to be good to his child so badly, but he couldn't help but feel like he was doing things incorrectly._¬†

_I wonder if my dad was like that with me when I was a baby?_  

My mother began to cradle the baby, gently shushing as she rocked the fawn back and forth, calming it. The cries slowly died down, and soon, the tiny buck was settled and sleepy.

Autumn peered up at me, our eyes connecting.

I just stood there and watched it all unfold.

_My mother had another child._

_The baby barely looked twelve months old._  

_I had a sibling._

  

Autumn glanced over at me with reluctance. She knew I was going to find out sooner or later. It was better to rip the Band-Aid off now. "Charlie, would you come with me, please?" She requested with a warm tone, making her way down the hallway.

Sharing one final glance with Lou, he nodded and looked to the floor. For some reason, that simple connection left me with some sympathy for the guy. I knew everything that I needed to know about him. I didn't want to learn anything more. I exited the living room and followed my mother through the narrow hallway, leaving Lou in the living room.

We reached a smaller room at the end of the hall, which seemed to be the kitchen; but, in all honesty, it could've been a closet due to how tiny and compact it was. This was a room that had actual furniture... _if I could even call it that._ Below a buzzing fluorescent lamp that hung from the ceiling, the kitchen appeared disordered and bland. The floor was tiled and the surrounding walls were decked out with a sink, a fridge, an oven, a counter with drawers, stoves, and other kitchen commodities, crowding the tiny space. It was tight and clustered, but miraculously, we both could fit.  

Autumn and I were finally alone in a room together. The mood was tense, as usual, but I felt safer. _I always did feel safer¬†when it was just the two of us._

"Can you get the baby bottle from the fridge?" She appealed politely, nodding her head to it as she leaned up against the counter, still gently bouncing the child to keep it distracted.

Instinctively, I went through with the order. I opened the fridge, which was very bare and had little inhabitants, acquiring a chilled plastic bottle of milk.

I closed the fridge and handed it over to her. Our paws touched slightly as I passed it, sending a shiver down my spine. I forgot the way her touch used to feel. Autumn shook the bottle and gradually inserted the tip into the baby buck's mouth. The child began to drink the solution.

I stood by the wall, closing the door to the kitchen and leaning up against it, a conflicted expression on my face. Autumn sighed, the same expression on hers. She observed as the baby slowly swallowed the formula, her eyes glancing up at me every now and then. It must've pained her to have me watch her mother a child that was not me.

"...Do I have a brother?" I questioned, crossing my arms and staring at the tiled floor.

"...A sister," she uttered after gulping and choking on her words.¬†

"...When did you have her?"

"...Three months ago." Autumn breathed in and out slowly through her nostrils, staring down affectionately at the infant fawn. "I first got pregnant about a year prior to today... We've spent the last twelve months scraping together every last dollar we had in order to move. We wanted to find a better, more child-friendly neighborhood. A better life for her. So, we worked as hard we could. Somehow, it eventually paid off."

_I've felt jealousy before, but this was a whole new manifestation of it._

_Although I was a grown adult, I suddenly felt the urge to be a kid again._¬†

_I wished to be held the way the baby was held in my mother's arms. I wished to be cradled and cared for by my parents. I wished to go back and, somehow, have a childhood where everything I needed was present and fulfilling._

_I wished to be reborn. I wished to start over._

_But, then, if things hadn't gone the way they were intended to, would I have the life I own now?_

_Would I have even met Skyler?_

"...Is that why you stopped writing?" I assumed, the date of the pregnancy lining up with the date of the last letter sent.

Autumn looked back down at the child in her arms, cautiously removing the bottle from the baby's lips as she was done drinking. It was unfortunate for her to say, but she still said it anyway: "...I had to focus on Charlotte..."

_I had a sister... named Charlotte..._

"I... I thought, maybe... I could do better this time." Teardrops had accumulated at her bottom eyelids. "As a mother."

Without thinking it over, I opened my mouth and spoke the first thing that came to mind. "...Did you name her that after me or were you just trying to replace me?"

Autumn looked back up, taken aback by my words. I knew that what I said was out of line, but I couldn't help myself. I still felt betrayed, even if it wasn't her intention. I was the failed attempt.

"Charlie, you know I would never try to replace you..." She took a single step forward and none further.

"...Mom, I thought you were _dead,_" I stated, loud and clear.

My mother froze and shot her glaring eyes directly at my face. She would've almost dropped the bottle if it weren't for her tight grasp on it.

I felt my limbs begin to shiver a little as I opened up about my harrowing past. "...A-After all these years, I... I thought you were _dead_... When you left, it was the _hardest_ point in my entire life, I-I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't even _breathe_, I... I thought you were dead, Mom... and I thought it was all my fault..."

"Charlie, it was never your fault...!" Autumn pressed, shaken by my words. She sat the bottle down on the counter and slowly approached me, holding her daughter dearly to her chest.

"I know it wasn't, I know that _now_, but... It hurt so badly when I _did_ believe it..." I shook my head, inching away from her as she got closer. I reduced to watery eyes again. _It just never seemed to cease. Now I know how Skyler felt in college_. "...My childhood was filled with so much traumatic shit, and I... I was scared to be at home with Dad, I was scared to go to school, I was scared to be _anywhere_... My behavior was careless, I did poorly in my classes and had awful grades, I got left back a year in elementary school... I got into fights, I fucked up with relationships, I fought with Dad every day and... I was filled with so much _anger_... I couldn't bear to keep going..."

A tear streamed down my face, enacting Autumn's motherly instincts. It was the same reaction she had when she heard Charlotte cry. I may be an adult, but I was still her son.

"Oh, Charles..." she pitied, wanting to show me physical affection as a way to comfort me through the pain, but her arms were occupied.

"Mom, I loved you..." I began, not knowing when to stop. I didn't want to. _I wanted to tell her everything, every single bottled-up feeling that I had generated inside of me and locked away, ever since she left._ "I loved you more than life itself, and even though I moved on, I still missed you... I never stopped loving you, even if you weren't there... I got better, though, Mom... I still have trust issues with Dad and everyone I come into contact with, but... I got better, slowly..."

_I thought back on my life and everything that happened in it. It all felt like one short, condensed timeline. A movie, or a story, or an episode of a TV series. It was linear and straightforward. None of it was complex. Ever since my mother left, life felt quick and passive. That was until I met Skyler._

"Ever since I made friends in high school and college, I've... I've slowly been getting better," I admitted with a drained simper, "But, there was no one I wanted to tell about it more than you, Mom. I... I used to talk to a photo of you at night when I was in high school because I had no one else to really confide in... Yeah, I had friends, but I was never that close to them..."

Then, I remembered the event that I always determined as the point in time where my life had changed for the better.

"...I even made a wish on you, Mom. On my twentieth birthday. I wished to go to college to get away from Dad, and when I got accepted, I thought it was because of _you_... I thought that, somehow, your... your 'ghost' had used magic and shifted things for me," I chuckled at the absurdity of it, "because, when I _did_ go to college, I was _so much happier._ I met Skyler, I made _real,_¬†close friends, and... I did what I loved to do, and I would always thank you every night... because I thought that _you_ were the reason. You had made my wish come true from beyond the grave‚ÄîI know that sounds crazy, but I believed it... But, when I found out you were alive this whole time, I..."

"...You realized that it was all supposed to happen anyway."

I looked up at Autumn, who hadn't left my side. She was right in front of me all this time, but I hadn't realized how close she was until she said something. I was in my own world. That, or, I was so used to being close to my mom as a child that I didn't find her proximity uncomfortable. In fact, it was the exact opposite.

I could see Charlotte in her arms. She wore baby blue dungarees and a bright, striped pink t-shirt underneath. She was sound asleep now. Usually, I never found babies that cute, but this little girl was absolutely _adorable_. She would _definitely_ grow up to be a strong, fearless, gorgeous woman one day. I knew it from only a look.

"...It wasn't fate, Charlie," Autumn told me, looking down at Charlotte. "...I didn't shift things, I didn't use magic... Everything that came after, that was all _you_, Charles. You got better, not because of me, but because of _you_." Her eyes then met mine, the intimacy of the moment growing more intense. "I had no impact on that, Charlie. And neither did Hugo, or Skyler, or whoever... _You_ got better because you _chose_ to get better. You reacted. And you shouldn't blame yourself for anything, because Charlie... _you did good._ Look at yourself, sweetheart, you did _good_. And you never needed me or Hugo for that."

I wanted to accept what she was saying, but something deep inside of me still wanted her parental affection. I've never gotten the chance to feel love from the presence of a mother for so long. I was deprived of it.

"...But, sometimes, it's good to have the comfort of a parent..." I confessed, wiping my cheeks and nose with the backside of my paw. "Everyone needs a little bit of love, sometimes, right?"

Autumn turned her head back down to Charlotte once more, noticing what I was referring to. She knew I longed for her love.

"...You're right," she concluded, rocking her daughter back and forth. "We should've been better parents, Charlie. I admit that. _I_ should've been better. I could've made a different choice, yes, I could've done things differently, I... I could've done it so that we could have stayed together and Hugo could have gotten the help he needed... But, I didn't. I was scared. And that made _you_ scared, Charlie. And that's not what a parent does to their child."

With a broken voice, I professed, "...I still love you."

"...I love you, too, Charlie." More tears fell from her eyes as she stared into mine.

"Do you think, if you never ran away, things could've ended up better?"

"...I ask myself that question almost every day..." Autumn retracted, stepping back and resuming the process of lightly bouncing the baby. "But, I think that... everything that was supposed to happen, _happened_. For the both of us. And we shouldn't dwell on the past. We made mistakes. We've screwed up. All of us. But, we're here. And we're alive. And that's all that matters."

Autumn, gazing endearingly at her daughter, said those words as if they came directly out of her heart. I tried my best to fight off the smile that slowly formed on my face, but it put up a good fight. Autumn was happy now, with her new family and her new daughter. What kind of person would I be to disrupt her happiness? I had to find my own.

And, now, I can safely say that I have.

"Hey," Autumn giggled, something coming to mind. "Look in the freezer."

I glanced back over at the fridge to my left, reaching for the freezer handle with confusion.

Opening it, I saw a few ice packs, a few boxes of frozen microwaveable foods, and a container full of ice cream desserts. That was when I remembered that Klondike bars were me and my mother's favorite snack. It was nothing but a cheap treat, but to us, it was something we favored together as mother and son. Something we connected on. Mom even made my middle name Klondike because she loved those things so much.¬†

Claire used to say that food was a beautiful representation of several important things in life: health, culture, and love.¬†

"Oh, my God," I laughed, reaching into the icy box of frozen treats. "I haven't had one of these in ages."

"The caramel ones are still my favorite," Autumn chuckled with embarrassment.¬†

Cold to the touch, I retrieved two Klondike bars and attempted to hand one to my mother. She was still holding Charlotte, so I unwrapped her dessert for her and then carefully put it into her paw. I removed the plastic wrapping from my ice cream bar as Autumn bit into hers.

"I can't believe you can still eat it with your teeth!" I gasped, stunned. It was always something I envied when I was younger.

"Mom's got skills, what can I say?" She smirked, mumbling as she munched down the chocolate-coated brick of vanilla ice cream.¬†

I tried my best to break off a piece without fully sinking my teeth into the frigid ice cream. Once I did, I ate it attentively to not give myself a brain freeze.

"I missed these things," I nodded as I swallowed, a specimen of nostalgia submerging my taste buds. "Didn't I have these instead of a birthday cake one year?"

"Yeah, it was for your eighth."

"How many did I have?"

"Seventeen, right?"

"Yeah, seventeen," I laughed.

The two of us got quiet once again after the subtle snickering died down. The memory of my eighth birthday always brought me bad trauma, but now, after being able to reconcile with my mother, I can finally look past all the bad and see that there was good in it, too.

_No matter how bad things get, there was always good somewhere._

We were on opposite sides of the room again, but this time, we felt closer. Without saying it, Autumn and I both thought about it, my eighth birthday, and how it had drastically changed our lives forever.

Our worlds were separated that day, forcing us down two different, and distant, roads.

There was nothing we could do to change that. What happened, happened.

What matters now is what we do next.

  

"...Are you happy here?" I asked her, knowing that her answer would lead me to a final, fatal conclusion. "...Are you happy here with Lou?"

Autumn nodded her head, confidently.

_Knowing she was finally happy brought me peace._

"...Are you happy with Skyler?" She reflected the question back at me.

If I answered her, it would be a done deal.

"Yes, Mom. I am."

  

That was when Autumn and I both knew that this would be our final moment with one another.

This was the last time we'd ever see each other again.

Although I've longed for her to be in my life, now that I've gotten the opportunity... things would change once again. Just like they did several years ago.

It's heartbreaking how our lives were torn apart due to reasons beyond our control. And it's heartbreaking to know that it would hurt more to rekindle that relationship.¬†

As much as I'd want to keep my mother in my life, I knew it would only make things harder.

Autumn was her own, content person now.

She had a supportive congregation, a loving husband, and a precious newborn daughter.¬†

I had a successful career, a fitting home, and the person I love most, by my side, at all times.  

She had her life and I had mine.

And it was time for us to return to them.

  

_I'm just glad I was able to get clarity._

_I'm glad that I was able to meet her, one last time, and resolve the everlasting issues that had been haunting me ever since I was a kid._

_Autumn was okay. And she would be okay. And so would I._

_I loved her and she loved me._

_And accepting the fact that I loved her, meant that I had to accept that it was best to let her go._

_There was no point in trying to fix things that have already been fixed themselves._

_Life was good. There was nothing more I could ask for._

_And that is the greatest responsibility of all._

_Accepting to leave things to the world to figure out._

# 38. LOVE, PHYSICALLY

\~~~

## Skyler

"I love you guys," I told my parents and Cal over the phone.

"We love you, too, pumpkin," my mother expressed, alongside my father, who spoke with a hoarse voice, "Stay safe out there in California!"

With a sharp exhale through my nose, I stuffed my paw into my left pocket and smiled, my heart fluttering with warmth. _I really did miss them._ "It's been two months already, I think I can handle it."

"Come back, I miss you!" I heard Cal whine in the background.

"That's a first," I chuckled at the fact that Cal had revealed his soft side for me. A tiny, sassy 'hmph' was his response. "I'm kidding, I'll be back to visit you guys, soon. I promise that."

"Take your time, honey," Mom reassured me, "We're doing alright, I promise."

"You sure?" I smirked, resting my paw on my hip and circling around on the pavement. "You haven't all killed each other yet, right?"

"Cal is borderline homicidal, but other than that, we're fine," Dad mocked with a suppressed cough. "Sorry, your dad's throat is just a little sore."

"I'll take your word for it," I stopped on the concrete and stared at the floor, a wide grin on my face. "Bye, guys."

"Bye, Skyler!" Mom and Dad said in unison, followed up by Cal shouting, "Don't die, Clouds‚Äî!"

His voice was then cut off as the line went dead, a result of them hanging up. It was a short, brief call, but I really needed it. I've always found everlasting comfort in my family. I removed the phone from my right ear and shut it off, inserting it back into the pocket of my pants.¬†

Looking up from the concrete, I stared at the modest, blue house in front of me. It's been a few minutes now.

_I really hope Charlie is doing okay in there._

I turned around aimlessly and landed my sights on Hugo, who was sitting on the edge of the sidewalk, his feet planted on the tar that paved the empty road ahead. I could only see the backside of him, his head hanging low as he slouched over. Through his body language only, the man appeared incredibly troubled.

Hesitantly, I walked over to the end of the sidewalk and sat down beside the large husky.

Resting my feet on the road next to Hugo's, he had turned his head slightly over to me. His expression wasn't emotional or anything, but he did seem conflicted. Leaning back on my hands, I gave him a passing glance; a subtle smile to comfort his anguish. He attempted to return it, but there wasn't a lot of energy left in him.

We both just decided not to say anything and, instead, let the silence be. The road was bare and the sun was hot, but the environment was calm and tranquil. The breeze blowing against my fur provided some relief.

"...I feel like I barely know anything about you," Hugo spoke up with a low, exhausted voice. I turned my head over to him, assessing the situation.

"There's not much to know."

"I'm sure there is," he straightened his back and looked forward instead of at the floor. "Charlie sees a lot in you. I can tell."

I slowly shifted my head over in the direction he was staring in. In the distance, I could only see a white fence, sturdy and tall, lining the edge of the road. Beyond that, the green tips of thriving summer trees were barely peeking over the wooden planks, along with the peaks of transmission poles, connected by thin telephone lines. A few birds soared through the sky as well, cutting through the mix of blue and white.

"...Charlie likes helping people," I said, taking in the view. "I think he fell in love with _helping_ me before he actually fell in love with _me_."

Without looking away, the voice to my left spoke quietly once again. "What do you like about Charlie?"

"...He loves to love." I bit my lip and fondled the gritty, pebbly grooves of the sidewalk under my fingers. "He can be lost sometimes, but all he ever really wants is to love."

"...Would he be open to loving me?"

_It wasn't my place to answer that question. Hell, I didn't even know the answer._

_But, the least I could do was give him hope. Sometimes, it's all anyone really needs._

"He's on his way," I told Hugo, shortly glancing over at him.

He glimpsed back at me, at the same time, before we both parted stares, returning to the view ahead.

"...You're a good person, Skyler," Hugo spoke, real and raw. "...I trust you with him. I think you're the only reason this all came to be."

"That's not true," I said with a suppressed chuckle. "The way I see it, everything works out, eventually. Only time will tell. What matters is if you have the patience to endure it."

I wasn't watching, but I could feel Hugo's eyes on me. It was only a short, fleeting moment between the two of us, but it meant something.

"You do art, right?" Hugo questioned me. I looked over at him and nodded my head. "...This hotel complex I'm building... I need floor plans, blueprints, and model designs. Do you know architecture?"

"I studied it a bit in college, yeah, why?"

"...Could I possibly hire you?"

\~~~

## Charlie

Opening the front door, I slowly stepped back out into the summer air, landing in the convenient shade on the white porch of my mother's house. In the distance, I saw Skyler and Hugo sitting beside one another at the edge of the sidewalk. It looked as though they were talking.

"Charlie..?" I heard Autumn call in a low, timid voice behind me.

I turned around and saw my mother, holding the door open from the inside. I could feel the way her eyes scanned my image, soaking up every last moment of my presence. She didn't want to forget the way I looked, compared to how I used to, sixteen years ago. She missed out on watching me grow. The heart-wrenching, sentimental strife in her eyes took me down in waves.

_I'll never stop loving her, no matter the distance. That's an unbreakable promise I'll make to myself._

She held out a slip of paper in her hand. "...Do you want my contact? Just so you know that you can reach me whenever you'd like?"

As much as I wanted to take it, I knew it wouldn't help at all. I shook my head, which my mother accepted definitively. She put it in her back pocket and leaned up against the door, pressing her head to the wood.

"Charlie, I... I..." She faltered, nothing right coming to mind. "...I want to say goodbye, but I don't know how..."

"...Don't," I told her, giving her a warm, comforting smile. "To me and Skyler, there's no such thing as goodbye."

"But..." Autumn sniffled, her eyes welling up with tears. "I..."

"Mom."¬†

I looked her directly in the eyes.¬†

_I hadn't forgotten that warm, hazel shade. I never will._¬†

"I know."

Autumn, wiping away her tears, nodded her head and accepted my response. "Happy birthday, Charlie," she shivered with a laugh, rubbing her messy, tear-infested face with her paw. "I'll see you when I see you."

Her smile was undeniably beautiful. Probably one of the most gorgeous visions I'd ever see in my life.¬†

_Oddly enough, I wanted to take a picture._

_But, as Autumn had said earlier, sometimes art is better off being left as art._

"I'll see you when I see you, Autumn," I nodded with a wide, happy smile.

Autumn nodded back.¬†

"Go," she encouraged, nudging her head in the direction of the stairs.

I didn't say a thing back. I just stared at her for a few more seconds, that same smile refusing to leave my face.

I turned to my right and journeyed down the steps, not looking back. I had already infused that final image of my mother in my head permanently, where it would stay forever.  

_Stay safe, Autumn Wingrave._¬†

_Stay safe._

\~~~

As the three of us journeyed back the way we came, the sun was about to set, revealing another side to the town of Sacramento. It was more reserved in the afternoon, more quiet and gentle. The whole neighborhood was lovely. I couldn't help but find my feet dragging a little as I slowed in pace, taking in my surroundings. It would likely be the last time I ever came here. Shame, it was truly gorgeous, the way the golden sun shone through the trees and layered down a heavy orange glow on the scenery, illuminating the many street art canvases and patches of flower bouquets growing from the ground.

I didn't know if it was the mild breeze against my eyes or the current events that were making them water, but, I knew for a fact that I didn't feel sentimental anymore. In fact, I was relieved. A giant weight was lifted from my back. I'm ready to be more open and loving, to the people around me, and to the people I love.

Skyler's paw intermingled with mine, causing me to take my sights off of the town and set them on the love of my life. A simple gesture to most, but to us, it was a physical declaration of love. The sun hit his face perfectly, his warm, pink eyes shining luminously in the glare. He gave me a comforting smile with true emotion in his expression before leaning in closer. He snaked his arms around mine, hugging my left arm tightly and pressing his face up against my shoulder. I rested my head on his as we walked down the sunset-painted sidewalk together.

Hugo was strolling along behind Skyler and I, likely watching the two of us love up on each other. I didn't care what my father thought of me anymore. I felt freer than I've ever been before.

Soon, we found ourselves back at Sacramento's Greyhound bus station, buying our tickets to return to our home in Los Angeles. After going through the same process repeated earlier this morning, Hugo, Skyler, and I boarded the vehicle that would carry us back to the place we belonged.

Skyler and I took our seats in a similar aisle as before, as did Hugo.

I stared out of the window next to Sky, taking one last look at the town as the sun began to cower its way behind the horizon of buildings and trees.

"She'll be okay," Skyler whispered into my ear, clutching my shoulder tenderly. I moved my eyes from the window to Sky, soaking up the solace that radiated from his gaze.

I sighed deeply, taking his words to heart. I closed my eyes and leaned in, pressing my forehead to Skyler's and collapsing into his embrace. He reached his arms around me and caressed my back, whimpering slightly in sympathy for me. I could feel my dad's eyes on us, but again, I didn't care.

Skyler clasped his paw around the backside of my head, leaning back and situating himself comfortably as consent for me to lie down. Graciously, I took his offer, allowing myself to cave in. I laid my body down sideways, landing my head into his lap and resting my feet on the seats. Once I had snuggled in securely, Skyler began to stroke his paw against my head kindly, the smooth touch of his fuzzy paw against my fur putting my entire body at ease. I fastened my arms around his legs, nuzzling my snout into the texture of his jeans. I felt my consciousness slowly drift away, the feeling of the bus being set into motion not affecting me in the slightest.

"Get some sleep," Skyler whispered, giving me the confirmation I needed to let myself relax.

_I've been so tired. It feels good to finally rest._

_Everything will be alright in the end._

_Everything will be alright._

  

And soon, I'm asleep once again.

\~~~

It was pitch black out now. The six-hour drive had completely taken the sun out of the sky, and we were almost home. The Greyhound vehicle stopped in the parking lot of the same bus station that we came to this morning. We were right back where we started. _Well, with some added changes._

Skyler and I, leaning against one another's shoulders, half-asleep and drifting off, were brought back to reality when Hugo carefully woke us back up.

"We're back," he mumbled in a calm voice, one that I hadn't heard since forever.

I blinked my eyes a few times as I slowly sat up from Sky's shoulder, adjusting to wakefulness. I patted Skyler on the shoulder, stripping him from his deep sleep. "Hon, we're back," I told him with a slurred voice, still a little drowsy. Sky, dozy and weary, leaned forward, breathing in heavily through his nostrils. He rubbed his eyes, gawking at me lethargically.

I held my paw out for his, which he took with no hesitation.¬†

Hugo made his way down the aisle of the empty bus, hopping off the vehicle. Skyler and I, not that far behind, stumbled through the bus, hand in hand. I wrapped my arm around Skyler, careful not to drop him. We thanked the bus driver for his service and dismounted the Greyhound, hitting the concrete floor.

Hugo was standing at the front of the bus station under the lamppost. Inside the building, we could see it was less abandoned than before, probably because it wasn't five in the morning this time. Skyler and I joined him on the sidewalk, ready to venture back to our house.

Back to holding hands, we walked past Hugo, thinking he would follow in pursuit. We almost crossed the street before Skyler noticed that he hadn't. I turned around in response to Sky nudging me, seeing that Hugo did not move from the sidewalk.

After letting go of Sky's paw and telling him, "Wait here," I strolled back over to where Hugo was.

Shivering from the unusually cold night atmosphere in June, I hugged my arms together for warmth as I approached my father. He just stood there, staring out into the distance, not bothered by my presence.

"Are you coming?" I asked him.

Hugo turned his head over at me, his glare striking me as different. _Usually, his face always appeared so mean and angry, but right now, for what felt like the first time in years, he looked like a normal person._¬†_A normal person giving me a normal stare._¬†_One that wasn't fueled by abuse or hatred._¬†

_He just looked at me. And, for some reason, it felt so alleviating._

"...I called an Uber on the bus," he told me upfront, his eyes glancing back and forth from the street to me. "You guys go ahead and go home."

I don't know why, but I felt almost a little disappointed. "...You don't want to stop by?"

Hugo just stared outward. Something was on his mind, but he didn't know how to say it.¬†  
"...It's alright, Charlie. Go home."

"...Alright." I nodded my head, accepting the dismissal.¬†

I turned my back on him, although, strangely, I wanted to stay. I didn't feel satisfied with how we were leaving things, after _everything_ that happened today; but, his wish was my command, so there was no use in trying to make things right. I headed forward, leaving him under the flickering lamppost at the front of the bus station.

But, before I could rejoin with Skyler, I heard Hugo call out from behind me.¬†

"Charlie, wait," he blurted out, the tone of his voice giving off a hint of reluctance, or maybe, even, fear.

I spun around on my feet, facing him once again. Separated by a few inches of distance, Hugo began to talk, staring down at the cement floor below him.

"I... Son, I..." He shook his head, his breath shivering with his cowardly composure.

I walked forward, closing in on the distance, allowing him to feel safe enough to express his inner feelings. "...There are _so_ many things I could say to you right now, but, um..." he wiped his nose with his knuckles, "Mostly, I, just... I know it amounts to nothing, but I'm sorry. For everything."

I heard it once today. To hear it again felt better. It meant that he still believed in what he said.¬†

It wasn't fake or an act, it was real. Real and true. This time, I could tell.¬†

"...You never should've... You never should've gone through what you did at such a young age, and‚Äîand I'll always hold myself accountable for that, but..."¬†

He scratched the area between his eyes and looked up at me, opening his mouth to breathe in the air around him.¬†

"I... I wanted to tell you that, um... I'm so _happy_... with, uh, with how you... how you turned out."

He nodded relentlessly, hoping that I understood. He was choking on his words, unable to put any voice into them. It was only just a stifled whisper now.¬†

"...No thanks to me, but..." he chuckled through the raspiness of his speech, "...I'm glad that you're... _better_ than... whatever I could've been..."¬†  

I could see the way his eyes grew teary under the glimmer of the lamppost. I could feel the same reaction taking place within my own eyes. Swiftly, I wiped my tears away before they could stream down my face.

"You did good, kid." Hugo attempted at a smile, his sore, red eyes filled with tears. "If that's, uh, if that's what you want to hear... You did good."

I couldn't hold back my emotions. I felt a single tear fall from my eyelid. My face began to ache with all the strain I'd been putting on it today.

"I'm proud of that." Hugo nodded with respect. "...I'm proud of you."

  

_I've been longing to hear those four words my entire life._

  

_I feel like, right now, I have everything I've ever wanted._

_There's nothing more I could ever ask for._

_From this day forward, I'll be content with everything that comes my way._

_Not everyone gets chances like these. I'll make sure to live happily and be grateful for everything life has given me, even if it's hard._

_I'll get through. Somehow, I will._

  

"Thanks, Dad," I smiled, tears streaming down my face uncontrollably.

"I'll see you soon, son," he dismissed with a subtle bow of his head.¬†

"I'll see you soon."

  

With one last look, I turned around and walked away.

Reuniting back with Skyler, we made the long and unwinding trek back to our house, starting up the steep incline of the hill.

Sky leaned his head against my shoulder as we proceeded, using me as a way to sturdy himself. I did the same, our arms locking together in the process. We were both heavily exhausted. It was a long day. And now, we were finally alone.

Eventually, we made it back to our house. _Our sweet, calm, lovely house._ Private and intimate in all the best ways possible. It belonged to _us_, and us _only_.¬†

As a kid, I never imagined I'd own a place alongside the person I love most, but yet, here we were. It was our safe haven from the world. Within those walls, the house has come to know who we are. It's seen our trauma, it's seen our love. Our house knows who Charlie and Skyler are to each other.

After heading up the porch, I fit the key through the lock, twisting it and unlocking the front door. Skyler hugged me from behind as we went inside, brushing his cheek up against my back and yawning with extreme tiredness. The both of us were ready to just unwind and collapse. We needed it. We deserved it.

Stumbling into the house, I threw my keys on the coffee table by the couch and kicked off my shoes feebly, almost tripping over the laces. I flicked on the tiny switch that powered on the overhead lights. Skyler closed the door behind us, pressing his back against it and sliding to the floor, where he proceeded to unlace his shoes neatly, in contrast to me.

I yawned profoundly, reaching for my tie and undoing it. I couldn't seem to get a strong grip on the fabric, though. It just kept slipping between my fingers. Skyler, noticing my struggle, came over and attempted to do it for me. I just dropped my hands and watched as he intricately loosened the knot of the tie, pulling it from my collar.

He dropped it onto the floor, his arms falling to his sides. We were both too lazy to pick it up. Instead, we just stared into each other's eyes.

Sky's eyelids were lowered halfway, listless and sluggish. I kept staring down at him, not knowing how to proceed from here.

_What happens now?_  

_There was nothing else planned for us. Nothing more to accomplish._

  

_Maybe sleep was the best option for now._

Something about the way Skyler was looking at me felt peculiar, though. No words were spoken between the two of us, yet, the atmosphere felt suddenly tense.

_Something was different. The mood had changed, but what to?_

All of a sudden, Skyler took matters into his own hands and reached up for me like a little kid.¬†

Instinctively, I bent down to his level, allowing Sky to do what he wanted. He began to kiss me, which would seem normal, but again, something felt different.

Different in a way that wasn't necessarily bad.

Skyler's paws fondled the sides of my head softly as he kissed me, his fingertips delicately tickling the many strands of pure, white fur on my neck and chin. The feeling sent tingles throughout my body, which resulted in me reaching down and submerging him into a large, comfortable bear hug.¬†

Sky just kept working away at my face, kissing not only my lips, but everywhere else. He maneuvered his mouth around my muzzle region, making contact with almost every inch of my snout, randomly and rapidly. The sound of several smooches filled the room along with suppressed giggles. I could feel his tiny, soft tongue making partial breakthroughs between his lips, sending a chill down my spine. It left such a funny feeling in my gut.

He reached up higher, his gentle pecks coating my cheeks and neck. He leaned up onto his tippy-toes, which caused us both to lose balance, stumbling backward for a second. We regained stability, chuckling softly, going back to it.

Sky hopped a little, his way of showing that he wanted to be carried. His kitten kisses were already too adorable for me to handle alone, so I fastened my arms around his waist and lifted him up from the floor. Skyler kicked his feet as I raised him into the air, leaning back to support his extremely light weight, causing another balance shift. I fell backward, my back slamming against the front door. We both grunted at the sudden impact.

I slowly lowered Sky back down onto his feet again, but that didn't stop him from getting what he wanted.¬†

He then proceeded to make out with me passionately, too abrupt for me to foresee.¬†

Unexpectedly, Sky pushed me back against the door again fiercely, his paws pressed up against it as he unloaded the weight of his kisses onto my muzzle.¬†

I grabbed ahold of him firmly, my paws clutching onto the sides of his torso and squeezing with anticipation.¬†

Before I knew it, a blood rush began to course through my veins.

A certain feeling was now taking me by surprise.

_This... was not expected._

Our breathing grew heavier.

Skyler's tongue broke through his lips and slithered its way into mine. I had done the same, our tongues intertwining and slobbering against one another, our saliva bonding, wet and thirst-quenching.¬†

He tasted so good. Bitter, but sweet. And even a little bit savory.¬†

_Shit... I can feel something growing slowly in my pants..._

Skyler, flustered beyond relief, tried to laugh, but instead let out a desperate moan.¬†

I did the same, chuckling and groaning breathlessly.¬†

Skyler's paws felt up the sides of my waist as I hooked mine underneath his arms, grasping onto his chest below his armpits, seizing the opportunity when it came.¬†

Flipping the script, I spun around and shoved Skyler up against the wall this time. He gasped again, not anticipating it, but somehow into it. My paws kept playing with his chest region, my thumbs rubbing in circular, clockwise cycles around the slight bumps underneath his delicately soft shirt. Again, something Skyler did not expect, but was into.

"Charlie..." he whimpered, his voice muffled by our salivating, needy jaws meshing together. He kept laughing uncontrollably, which evolved into pleasurable moaning.¬†

_So much for being tired..._

I groped his hips and brushed my paws back and forth across the hemline of his loose t-shirt, cautiously maneuvering my paws underneath.¬†

Careful not to advance any further for Skyler's sake, I just kept caressing his thin, rounded waist, stroking his fur and skin below. I could almost feel the hardened bones of his skeleton underneath the many outer layers of his complexion, which made me feel strangely closer to him. The curves of his waist were symmetrically perfect and stately crafted. The glorious feeling of his body shape was starting to make me lose my mind. My tail began to wag incessantly, making my whole body quiver and weaken with pulsating, tender lust. Skyler reacted by grasping the flailing member with feeble strength, holding it still.¬†

The feeling of my tail being restrained activated my wolfish, canine instincts. The domineering husky within me wanted to be free. Let loose. In control. The small feline taking power, teasing me for my weaknesses; it just didn't sit right with me. _I_ _had to be in charge._¬†

Skyler, knowing how badly I wanted it, allowed me to take control.

_I guess we won't be sleeping just yet..._  

Shaking free of his grasp, I pounded my body against Skyler, grinding my crotch against his. Our kissing broke off as I focused my attention on the continuous motion of my lower body pressing against Skyler, back and forth repeatedly with rhythm. Skyler yelped with erotic pleasure, losing control of his breathing and hyperventilating at the same tempo of our grinding.

I groaned intimately, my vocals wavering with the blissful feeling of sexual satisfaction just out of reach. I wanted it so badly. The only thing holding us back was the simple, thin layer of clothing between our bodies. Lose that and we'd be unrestrained and free like wild, ravenous animals.

"...Charlie..! Ah!" Skyler whined, seizing his paws onto my shoulders and brushing his face up against my snout, dragging his nose across mine. He attempted to kiss me again, but couldn't get a sense of direction due to all the aggressive motion, so he just kissed whatever his lips could make contact with. I loved the feeling of Sky all over me just as much as he did with me.

With his fingers clutching the fur on the back of my head, Skyler and I faced each other, our jaws breathlessly hanging open, gasping for air and yearning for the taste of one another.¬†

_Sure, most of the original plans for my birthday were skipped out on, but there was one thing left on our roster that we'd be able to get done by tonight._  

I could see it in his eyes. He wanted me. Badly.

_We knew what we had to do._

_There was no more preparation. We've been waiting for this moment for far too long._

_We had to take the chance. We wanted it. We needed it._

_It was time._

Skyler and I ditched the front door and, with my paws held securely around Skyler's waist to keep him from tripping, we raced for the doorway that led to the hall with excitement and eagerness. Halfway down the corridor, Skyler spun around and began to make out with me again, hungrily and driven with lust. I grabbed onto him, taking the weight of his body against mine, crashing into the wall.

Desperately, Skyler parted his lips from mine and insistently jumped for the buttons of my polo, undoing them vigorously and impatiently. I assisted him in the trouble, unbuckling my belt with messy precision as he ripped open my polo, exposing my bare and burly torso. Skyler's paws then stuck to my neck as I walked forward, pushing him against the opposing wall, stripping the polo shirt from my body, next, the belt. My forehead collided with Skyler's as a way to balance myself as I took one article of clothing off at a time. My mouth was wide open, exhaling and inhaling rapidly with low, trembling grumbles. Sky couldn't keep quiet either, quivering and giggling with no restraint.¬†

Whipping the belt away from my pants, I tossed it to the side, utilizing my paws for more important things. They clasped onto Skyler's neck as I pulled him away from the wall, kissing him with an unvanquished force of sexual desire, making our way towards the end of the hall. I hopped onto my right foot, yanking off one of my socks before alternating onto my left foot to do the same with the other, leaving all the clothes behind on the floor.

The two of us slammed into the bedroom door, still passionately making out, sweating and shaking with amorous cravings. With my foot, I kicked the door closed behind us, picking Skyler up by the waist and lifting him into the air.

It was clear shot for the bed.

With Skyler in my arms, I dashed for the mattress, falling over and collapsing down onto it with him underneath me. Sky screamed with thrill as I sat up and crawled onto the bed, picking my feet up from the floor and climbing over the flustered feline. I reached for the bedside table, switching on the lamp to provide us with some sort of light source. When Skyler was in full view, I grabbed his paws, our fingers interlinking and tightening into fists, and pushed him down into the blankets, holding Skyler hostage.

I would've thought it to be a little traumatic, but Sky was different now. He'd long forgotten about those days. It was time to make _new_ memories. Ones that would last longer for all the _right_ reasons.

Kissing Skyler's neck, I couldn't help but sink my fangs into his fur, which made him gasp and cry with euphoric ecstasy. My needy paws couldn't keep off of Skyler's body. They made their way down his torso and grasped the edge of his shirt. With one clean, fluent motion, I tugged the underside of his shirt upward, ripping it from his body and throwing it across the room.¬†

Sky, falling back down onto the bouncy mattress, kept moaning with elation as I unbuttoned his jeans, slowly pulling them down from his hips... to his thighs... to his knees... and finally, to his feet. Every inch of fur that showed by every sliver I uncovered turned me on even more. The pink-and-blue striped pattern along his thighs and ankles was so hot to me for no reason at all. I got so fucking horny undressing Skyler, the way I could just expose him with his permission for my eyes only. Even when removing his cute little socks, too. Tonight, he was all mine. Every part of him.

As I flung Skyler's jeans over my shoulder and off the bed, I sat up onto my knees, looking down at the beautiful feline that lay in the bed underneath me. My eyes scanned every part of his body. His cute, innocent expression‚Äîhis gorgeous fur pattern‚Äîhis broad shoulders‚Äîhis defined collarbones‚Äîhis thin and sculpted torso‚Äîthe pink stripes that traced around his arms, waist, and legs. His chest and stomach were both a brighter shade of blue than the rest of his body, providing for some interesting variety. This beautiful creature was something else entirely.¬†

"You look adorable..." I swooned, staring down at Skyler with a sultry, hypnotized gaze. I almost drooled all over his red-hot, blushing face.

The way Skyler's attractive legs rubbed against one another at the knees, shyly and timidly, making the subtle bulge in his underwear more visible, felt like a clear invite to enter him.¬†

I wanted to feel every single part of Skyler tonight, inside _and_ out. I wanted him all to myself, every area of his body, every surface; I didn't want _anything_ to go untouched.

I could tell he was a little scared of what I'd do to him, but he enjoyed the fear. Skyler stared up into my eyes, a harmless, naive aura radiating off of him. This would be his first time _actually doing it_. I couldn't believe that _I_ had the honor of taking _Skyler Clawfield's_ virginity. _Me_, Charlie Cooperton.

_Sure, I've had sex many times before, but... this time, it just felt different. Not because it was my first time having 'gay sex', but... Skyler, himself, was different. He was precious, delicate, and fragile. I had to treat him with the utmost respect, responsibility, and care tonight. If I was a catering boyfriend before, I had to be double that now._

"Sky..." I leaned down, towering over the feline and pinning him down in the bed. "...Are you sure?"

Skyler licked his bottom lip, biting it nervously. "...Yes, Charlie. I'm ready."

Accepting his response, I sat up from the bed and reached for the box of condoms at the bedside table. They've been sitting there, lying dormant, every night, since I got them; serving as a small teaser for what would come. _Now, they'll finally be put to use._¬†

I grabbed one from the box and ripped open the wrapper with my teeth as Skyler situated himself in the middle of the bed, symmetrically sat between the pillows. He grabbed the blanket and cloaked it over him as he started to remove the last bit of clothing underneath, stripping down completely.

With a condom in my hand, I crawled back over to Skyler, kicking my pants off in the process. I grabbed the blanket and joined him under the sheets, my paws and knees planted firmly in the mattress around his smaller figure, completely looming over him.

As I tried to gain a steady balance, Skyler turned onto his stomach, his back arched and facing me, waiting nervously and expectantly. He probably assumed it was the position I wanted him to be in.¬†"Wait, no, I want to look at you..." I laughed a little and touched his shoulder, getting him to flip back around.¬†

"Charlie..." Skyler spoke up before advancing, his paws pressing up against the pillows. "You'll... You'll be gentle, right?"

In the way he looked at me, I could see how much he meant it. He definitely wanted this, but as per usual, he was still a little frightened. I mean, _anyone_ would be. But, tonight, it was _my_ _prime_ _duty_ to make sure Skyler was the _most_ comfortable he's _ever_ been in his _life._¬†No matter what.

"Of course, honey," I promised below my breath, kissing his cheek gingerly. "I'll be _so_ gentle, sweetheart, I promise..." I whispered into his ear before kissing it, too.

"...Okay," he gasped for air, preparing himself. "Okay, okay... I'm ready, Charlie..."

I nodded with a warm smile, carrying on with the task. _It was now or never._

With some struggle, I removed my boxers from below the blankets, chucking them to another side of the room when they were ripped clean off. We were now fully exposed, our bare genitalia just hidden under the covers.

I placed the elastic product around the tip of my dick, stretching and pulling it down, encasing my hardened member within the condom.

My arms slid underneath Skyler's thighs, and before he knew it, I tugged him forward in the bed, pulling his legs up to my shoulders. Sky whimpered, his limbs trembling and his thighs shuddering with a mix of nerves and pleasure. I towered back down over him, getting into a more comfortable position. My lower abdomen pressed up against the area between his legs, feeling up every inch in the space separating his inner-thighs, my paws clutching his calves with desire.¬†

Skyler reached over me and grabbed the blanket, pulling it over the two of us. It went all the way up to our shoulders, shielding him and I from whatever remained on the outside. My muzzle, barely levitating over Skyler's lips, leaned in for one more strong, passionate kiss. It would be the final gesture of confirmation. Sealing the deal. _We were ready._

"I love you more than anything in the world," I told him, loud and clear.

"I love you more than _anything_," he repeated back with a whimper.

Skyler then nodded, giving me the consent needed to continue onward.

# 39. SHE

\~~~

## Skyler

Charlie's sweaty, dampened fur encased me like a thick, winter coat as his overheated body spooned me from behind in the bed. His hot breath on the back of my neck, paired with our intertwined limbs producing a sweltering warmth under the heavy blankets, almost caused me to have a heat stroke.

We were both out of breath, exhausted, our muscles and bones aching with the aftermath of insurmountable pleasure. The air felt thick and moist; evaporated particles of our manufactured lust floating through the atmosphere like a clogging mist.¬†

Charlie's paws traced delicately around my stomach as he pressed his forehead against the side of my head. His legs brushed up against mine, the fur and skin between our thighs, ankles, and interlocking arms stuck together as if we were both slathered in glue.¬†

I closed my eyes and allowed myself to finally catch my breath. My tensed-up nervous system began to unwind as my body melted into Charlie's embrace, a bead of sweat dripping down my forehead. I felt like a steaming radiator, and Charlie's hold over me, plus the blankets, did nothing to sequester the heat.

I could hear his intense breathing, along with the feeling of his chest rising and falling slowly against my back. I could almost feel his lungs expanding and shrinking beneath the layers of his fur and skin.¬†

With a slobbery and unkempt muzzle, he layered down a few sloppy kisses on my neck, not much precision and care going into them. He was too worked out to be intricately affectionate. He just wanted to kiss me however he pleased. And I wasn't complaining.

"...You did it," he exhaled heavily into my ear; a failed attempt at a whisper and more of a gush of hot air, billowing out of his mouth. "You did it, Sky..."

Touching my tongue to the roof of my mouth, brushing it across the top layer of my teeth, I released a deep and relieving sigh. _I did it._

My head sunk further into the pillow that cradled my head, which carried a minor puddle of sweat, my body going numb from all the wasted stamina. I wanted to say something, but I just didn't have it in me. All that came out was a suppressed whimper.

My whole body was in pain.

_But, dear God, it was so worth it._

My left paw inched its way over to Charlie's with feeble strength, which was fastened securely around my stomach. I brushed my thumb gently against his hand, my disabled way of communicating.

Charlie chuckled softly, turning his hand around so I could hold it the right way. Our fingers interlocked lethargically, our physical symbol of love. Charlie exhaled through his nostrils, burying his snout into the fur on the back of my head. He breathed in and out, inhaling my scent and kissing my head at a sluggish pace.

My mind raced over everything that had happened in the last fifteen minutes. Every little detail.

The way he made me feel so comfortable in giving my body away to him. The way he treated me with such gentle care and affection. The way he entered me so tenderly and considerately.¬†

The only times I've ever been touched like that was when I was forced into intercourse against my own will. I always saw sex as a prison, where I'd be mistreated and demeaned, held down and restricted. But, With Charlie, I was treated as a real, living, breathing person with emotions and complications and preferences. I felt safe and in good hands. He was the only person I trusted to take away my virginity, and he did with such a kindred sweetness to it. Charlie Cooperton has always been a sweetheart, even when things got hot and heavy. He handled me with love, and that was all I really wanted in my first time.

It hurt like hell, that's for sure, but Charlie guided me through it. Soon enough, the pain didn't feel like pain anymore and slowly shifted into pleasure. I had overcomplicated sex so much. I had no idea it would be so simple. The idea is difficult to tackle, but when you strip away all the layers, all it really is is just physical affection. Physical love. Composed through the bodies of two human beings in deep, wholesome intimacy.

_When it's with someone you truly, truly care for... it's a privilege. Not a prison._

_I wish I had understood that sooner, because now... I don't want to lose this feeling._

_Sometimes, it feels indecent, or inappropriate, or gross, or even flat-out wrong to have these feelings... but, sometimes, it's the best feeling in the whole world._

_Lust stems from love, and it's evident in the things Charlie and I did tonight._

_I had given my body away to Charlie, but he had also given his away to me. It was almost like a compact, a treaty of some kind. It was like we had signed the official papers that professed our permanent love for each other. Sometimes, that's scary, but right now, I don't want anything in the world more than him._

_I just want Charlie. Forever._

"...Was I good?" I worked up the nerve to say, still unable to talk clearly and cohesively. My voice sounded like a loose, out-of-touch slur.

"Oh, Sky..." Charlie panted, his embrace growing tighter and tighter by the second. His spooning, along with the blanket wrapped around me, began to feel like a claustrophobic, vacuum-sealed container. I loved the way it felt. "...You were incredible..."

I could hear the smile in his voice.

He was wonderfully pleased with how I had performed tonight. I guess I really did have it in me.

"...Really?" I chuckled softly, an emotional smile of gratitude forming on my face.¬†

"God, you felt... so good..." Charlie gasped with unending satisfaction, gently grinding against me with the little sliver of strength he had left inside of him. "...Fuck, I... I haven't had sex like that in so long..."

"...Was it _that_ good?"

"Whatever it was, babe, it was fucking _phenomenal_..."

Maybe it was because the last time he had sex was a few years ago and this experience was pleasurable enough to satisfy his long-suppressed hormones... but I liked to assume that I was just good in general.

"...Good to know," I giggled, rather enjoying the boost in self-esteem. Charlie just kept unleashing his lips down on my neck, his love for me unhindered. My body began to squirm at the ticklish kisses, suddenly feeling the icky, damp substances below the blanket against my fur. A shiver was sent down my spine. "...Ugh, is it supposed to feel this way..? All sticky and gross?"

"You get used to it after a while," Charlie laughed below his breath.

"I should've worn a condom, too," I grunted, my body tensing up in reaction to the dirty sheets. "It probably would've made less of a mess." _I honestly feel like, sometimes, I'm a passionate germaphobe, but when it comes to paint and stuff, I don't mind getting a bit messy. I guess I'll just have to pretend it's paint for now._

"Sky..." Charlie's paw reached for my chin, tilting my head back to face him. Looking over my left shoulder in the bed, I could see the pride in his expression. "...I'm so proud of you... You finally did it, sweetheart... You lost your virginity..."

With little effort, I shifted in the bed, carefully laying down on my left side this time, facing Charlie with my whole body. I saw his face in full, the respect he had for me, the honor and the gratification. As I stared deeply into his eyes, I could feel mine light up as well, hypnotized by his warm, loving gaze.

"...How does it feel?" He asked curiously, stroking my bare shoulders with his palms, going up and down my arms. "...Not being a virgin anymore?"¬†

I bit my lip, all flushed and blushing, staring at his chest to keep my eyes off of his cheeky expression.

"...I feel like my whole body has been turned inside out."

We both laughed breathlessly at that, our paws coming together within the dense space between our bodies, our fingers intertwining and clutching tightly and compassionately. Charlie coated on a few more kisses, pecking at each and every finger of mine.

"...Did it hurt?" Charlie asked a little nervously, pressing my paw up against his lips, not to kiss it, but just to feel it on his mouth.

"A little, yeah..." I admitted, sneaking in closer and pressing my nose to his paw, which was still grasped tightly onto mine. "...But I got used to it."

Charlie then interlocked his pinky finger with mine, kissing his thumb as if it were a bridge of ardent love, passing from his lips‚Äîacross his fingers‚Äîacross mine‚Äîover to my thumb, which I kissed in return.

"...Is it strange to say that I'm nervous right now?" Charlie confessed, chuckling awkwardly.

"What?" I tilted my head with a sympathetic giggle. "_You?_ Why?"

"I dunno..." Charlie muttered, unable to stop his smiling. Somehow, he was more flustered than I was. He looked down and pressed his forehead to our intertwined paws. His left hand retreated from the hold and made its way around my hip, feeling up the curves of my waist and the skeletal ridges of my ribcage underneath my skin. "...I wanted it to be perfect... I'm scared that I might've lost control somewhere in the middle of it... I didn't make you uncomfortable at any point, did I?"

"Oh, Charlie..." I professed, "It _was_ perfect."

Charlie looked back up at me, our eyes meeting once again. I could see the pure joy in his gaze. He was so happy to hear that. His tail began to wag gently under the covers, making the blanket ripple and shake on top of us. Charlie just covered his face with both of his paws, embarrassed to be seen this way.

"Aww," I whimpered, reaching forward and hugging Charlie intimately. "Don't worry, I won't hold it down this time," I whispered into his ear, referring to his unrestrained tail, making him laugh.

Charlie couldn't hold back anymore. His mouth calmly lunged at me, pressing his lips against mine, romantically and lovingly. He didn't kiss me harshly or rampantly. He didn't use his tongue or lose his breath. He just kissed me so, so softly.¬†

It reminded me of our first ever kiss. It was innocent, young, shameless love. A blossoming connection between two timid, yet, heartfelt lovers. It was new. It was a 'first'.¬†

What had happened tonight was a 'first', too. And that blossoming connection had never felt so familiar.

And, for the first time, I felt good about not being in the past anymore. The _now_ was all I wanted.

"You were so cute and innocent the entire time," Charlie snickered, our noses still touching, the proximity of our faces closer than ever. "It looked like you had no idea what you were doing and you were confused, but you just went along with it and I thought that was _so_ adorable..."

"Shut up..." I whined, my face burning redder than a strawberry.¬†

"The sounds you making were so high pitched compared to mine, it didn't even sound like moaning‚Äî"

"‚ÄîShut up‚Äî!" I laughed, slapping him feebly on the arm.¬†

"‚ÄîI swear, it sounded like you were crying‚Äî"

"‚Äî_Charlie!"_ I moaned, leaning my head back as I whimpered in humiliation. Charlie just seized his arms around my torso and tugged me in, even more, moving further down in the bed. He started to make out with my neck and my collarbones, not getting enough of my body. I looked down at him, clasping my hand over my grinning mouth, watching him kiss my chest repeatedly.

Faint, ecstatic moans came from him in between every peck. My paws explored his back as he stuffed his face into my fur, suddenly tracing my fingers against peculiar scrapes and jagged indentations going down his spine. These marks were fairly new, I could tell by the feeling of the raw skin.

"Woah, what happened here...?" I pondered, peering over his shoulder and viewing the slightly pinkish-red scratches all along his back.

"Oh, yeah, you tore my back open," he said, still kissing me as if it were no big deal.

"I‚ÄîWhat?!" I gasped, my jaw dropping from the sound of his words. He separated his jaw from my body and glanced up at my shocked expression.

"Yeah, I know, you got really into it," he chuckled, pushing back a few strands of fur from my face. "You just clawed away."

"...My claws came out?" I marveled, staring at the fingertips of my, usually, fluffy paws. They had retracted again, but it was clear that my claws had poked out _sometime_ during sex.

"Mhm," Charlie smirked as if he were proud of me. "It didn't hurt, though, don't worry. It actually felt kinda good."

"Weird," I chuckled, stopping the paw examination and placing it back onto his shoulder. "First-time instincts, I guess."

"If you think about it, this is sort of a first-time for me, too."

"How so?"

"First time having sex with a boy."

That was when I felt my entire body shiver, a sense of guilt running through my conscience.¬†

I had lost my smile, but Charlie hadn't noticed. He pressed his ear up to my chest, listening to my pulsating heartbeat. I couldn't tell if it was beating rapidly because of the post-sex or the sudden fear.

"What is it like to... Um..." I stammered, gulping down saliva, not knowing what to say. "What is it like to have sex with a boy and... not a girl?"

Charlie just kept listening to my heart, his eyes shut tight. "...I mean, there's not much of a difference... apart from the feeling, I guess."

"...Is it better with boys or girls?"

"I don't know, Sky, it felt the same," Charlie told me. Then, realizing what had just come out of his mouth, he shook his head and immediately started blabbering, afraid that he had possibly offended me. "Not‚ÄîI didn't mean‚Äîlike, I don't think‚ÄîI'm not saying that my time with _you_ felt the same as my _other_ times, no, every person feels different‚ÄîI'm just saying, you know, it _feels_ the same." I didn't change my expression. "Just a dick going in and out," Charlie laughed it off, trying to lighten the mood. I attempted at joining him, but it didn't come off as well.

"If you had to choose, boys or girls, what would you pick?"

"...I really don't know, Sky," Charlie scoffed, confused by why I was asking. "I just choose you."

Looking down at him, seeing the sparkle in his eyes... The pure, raw, affection in his face... The way he held me as if he'd never let me go...

_Charlie loves me._

_There's no doubt about it._

_He loves me, infinitely, unconditionally, endlessly, in every way imaginable._

_I have to stop hiding away. I have to stop playing the coward._

_Charlie faced his demons for me. And he's so happy now._

_I have to face mine._

_I have to tell him._

  

Charlie's facial expression had shifted slightly from joyful to worried. My hesitant silence was already triggering his urge to protect and care for me. His ears had drooped and his brows had furrowed. I could tell he was already prepared to shower me with comfort. He's always known how to handle me before the issue has even taken place. That's how well he knows me.¬†

_But, there's still some left for him to uncover._

Before Charlie could even ask if something was wrong, I opened my mouth and just went for it.

"Charlie, I need to talk to you about something."

"...Yeah, okay..?" He slowly nodded his head and scooted up in the bed to my level, our heights matching in order to maintain a serious, focused conversation. "What's wrong, Sky?"

My jaw, still hanging open, was as barren as the desert. Nothing came out except for cobwebs and flies.¬†

I had no idea how to tell him.¬†

I felt my tongue rotate around the roof of my mouth as I thought hard about _what_ I was going to say, _how_ I was going to say it, and _why_ I said it.

_That's a good place to start._

_Why do I want this?_¬†

_I've always felt as though this topic was something difficult to conversate on, considering how heavy and sensitive it is in the media and politics today. But, I sometimes fail to recognize that this choice isn't one I'm making for society. It's for me._

_At its core, it's just me. Wanting to be what I want to be. What I'm comfortable as. What I want to be seen as. What I want to be loved as._

_I want this because I want this. The simplest truth, yet the hardest to convey._

_But, I can try._

_Either way, I know Charlie would never love me any less, despite how afraid I am of his answer._

_I just have to trust the little hope left in me._

  

"...I've been having doubts about my masculinity," was the first sentence that came out of my mouth. "And I've always felt more feminine than most men my age, throughout every stage in my life," was the second.

Charlie just waited, quietly and patiently, listening to and hearing me for what I had to say.

"That feeling was always in the back of my head, preying on my thoughts and actions, yet... I never came to terms with it. Until very recently."

Charlie's paws crept their way into mine again.

He was here for me. He always would be.

_Just tell him everything, Sky. It'll feel so good to finally be free._

_It'll feel so good._

"I think I might be living a lie, Charlie," I shrugged, my eyes watering as I reflected over my past and every moment I've spent living as someone else. Someone false. "I'm not who I appear to be. And the truth is... I think I might actually be female."¬†

Charlie just nodded and leaned in further. He rubbed his fingers gently around mine, showing me that he was here. He was real, he was present, and he loved me.

"I've thought about it for years, and I've hidden from it... but I can't anymore. I've always been a girl. I've always felt like a girl. I've always seen myself as a girl. I've always loved you... as a girl... But I've always appeared as a guy. And I can't stand it anymore. I'm... I'm a girl, Charlie."

He just kept nodding, waiting for the right moment to speak.¬†

When I had gone quiet for more than a few seconds, Charlie opened his mouth and stated simply:¬†

"Okay, Sky."

I could see it in his eyes. He was proud. Nothing had changed.¬†

The way he held my hands felt so caring and attentive. I've never felt safer in my entire life than I have in this moment. Charlie nodded and spoke, "Okay."

"...I've always been a girl," I repeated, sniffling, my voice breaking up. I wiped my eyes swiftly so that his hold over my paws never broke. "I, just, never noticed it because the world assigned me as male and I grew up with male expectations, but... I've always felt different."

"Okay," he smiled tenderly, gently kissing my hand. "Okay, Sky."

I kept having to retract my paw from his for every tear my eye had shed. Charlie just watched and took it in, saying nothing more than 'okay'. My eyes frantically danced around the room, awkwardly waiting for something more to occur. All Charlie did was whisper, 'okay'.

"...What do you think?" I questioned him with a whimper, fearful of his answer. "What do you think about me like _this?"_

"What do you mean?" Charlie queried, shifting in closer.¬†

"...Are you happy? Sad? Say something other than 'okay'..." I pleaded, squeezing his paws with anticipation. "I'm sorry if I'm disappointing you..."

Charlie's eyes had widened to the size of golf balls. "What?! Sky‚Äî"

It was now all coming out like a jug of water punctured with a knife, the liquid spilling out uncontrollably. "I was scared of what you'd think of me... I was scared of your judgment so I never told you... I'm sorry I lied for so long... I'm sorry I lied, even when I criticized _you_ for lying, I was, just... _so_ scared so I hid it away, and..."

As I rambled on, Charlie shook his head more and more, painfully distraught by my words. "Oh, Skyler..."

Charlie, with his paws now gently smothering the sides of my face, stared deeply into the pupils of my eyes as if he were bargaining with my soul. There was no way out of his grasp. He held me as if I were on the edge of a cliff, dangling over an endless abyss.

"I'm scared of what _everyone_ will think. I'm scared of being judged, Charlie, I don't want things to change... I don't want to be seen differently... By my friends and family, but...¬†_especially_ you..."  

"Sky, listen..." He moved his hands away from my face and planted them firmly on my shoulders. All I could do was lie still and listen to what he had to say to me. "Regardless of what I think, it's _your_ choice.¬†_I_ should have no influence over this decision. It's _yours_. It's your thing, not mine. So, never, ever, depend what's good for you on _my_ affection or _anyone else's."_

I couldn't fathom a proper response. I could only ask, "But, what _do_ you think? I just want to know, Charlie..."

"What do _you_ think, Sky?" Charlie turned it around on me.

"...You're okay with me transitioning?"

Another smile climbed its way onto Charlie's face, spreading from one end of his muzzle to the other. His eyes glistened with an oncoming wave of tears; the one thing we just couldn't seem to escape today.

"Sky, I am so much more than fucking _okay_." His paws were now on my chest, his fingers brushing through my fur, clutching at the strands. "I _love_ you, and I _love_ the choice that you're making. No matter what, I will _always_ love Skyler Clawfield, whether they're a boy or a girl. Skyler Clawfield will always be the love of my life."

_He accepted me. Just like I knew he would._

_There were so many voices in my head telling me that he wouldn't, and they got to me, but between all the doubts and the shame, there was still hope. And that hope was proven to be true._

_Charlie had accepted me, fully and lovingly._

A tear rolled down my cheek as Charlie's contagious smile made its way onto my face as well. Finally, I felt relief. _Real_ relief. I didn't have to be afraid anymore. If Charlie accepted me, that opened up the possibility for others to accept me.

"...I was scared you'd lose interest in me," I chuckled at the absurdity of my overthinking, rubbing my moistened eyes.

"What?" Charlie gasped at my words, finding it absurd as well.  

_Why did I waste so much time being afraid of his response? It was Charlie, the most accepting person on this planet. The best boyfriend I could ever ask for._

_Of course, he'd accept me, of course, he would!_

"I dunno, I... When we first started dating, you... You said that boys were more interesting to you than girls... You said it was new and exciting‚Äî"

"Sky, first, why are you holding onto something I said _four years ago?_ And second, what does that matter?"

"I was just _scared_. I didn't know how to feel about it, and it was still such a new scary feeling... I was so terrified that I started to feel like I was losing everything in my life; myself, you... I was scared I was gonna lose you... I didn't want you to leave me... Because I loved you so much and I _still_ do, I love you more than anything..."

Charlie dragged me into another large, constricting hug, squeezing all of the air out of me like a snake.¬†

"I would _never_ leave you," he whispered into my ear desperately, drawn out to show how much he believed it. He was on the brink of crying, too. These words ran to his core. "That's not a promise, that's a _fact_. I would never... _ever_... leave you."

Within Charlie's arms, I could barely breathe, but I didn't care. His body was a temple of healing and tranquility. I could rest here endlessly until the day I die without a single fear or worry.

_To me, home wasn't a place. It wasn't a specific location. It wasn't my childhood bedroom. It wasn't the apartment on campus. It wasn't even this house that Charlie and I bought together._

_Home, to me, was the people I surrounded myself with._

_The people I love._

_My family. Mom, Dad, Cal..._

_My friends. Claire, Becca, Jonathan..._

_My best friend. Charlie._

Within Charlie's arms, I was home.

And I never wanted to leave it.

I hugged Charlie back with the same, intense force. I nuzzled my face into the crevice of his neck, sheltering in his pure, white fur and using his body as a shield, warding off outside dangers. "I'll never leave you, too..."

"You're the light of my life," Charlie breathed, his throat discreetly vibrating with every syllable against my face. I could feel every part of him, every bone, every vein, every _atom_. Charlie knew _every_ part of me, too. Outside _and_ in. He held me so close that our bodies almost fused together and became one. _As weird as it sounds, I wouldn't mind it happening._ "You're everything to me, Skyler..."

"I want to spend the rest of my life with you," I confessed. "Is that weird?"

"I want nothing more, Sky." He shifted his muzzle around and kissed my forehead. "I don't _just_ want a life with you... I want eternity."

"You're saying some pretty heavy stuff..."

"It's true..."

"Are you implying what I think you're implying...?"

"Shh... Don't ruin the surprise..."

"Okay... I'll erase it from my memory..."

Charlie snickered and leaned back, taking in the sight of my face.

"So, tell me..." He prompted, playing with my ears lightly as if he were toying with cotton. "How does _this_ work? Help me understand."

Charlie had given me the stage, opening up our moment together as a safe space for me to share.

"...I would just like to be addressed properly," I told him; short, sweet, and to the point.

"Can you explain it to me? I want to be the most supportive I can be."

I giggled and scooted up in the bed, my arms resting on Charlie's shoulders. It began to make my heart flutter, finally being able to talk about all these things I've held back, freely, in front of him. "Well, I'm still Skyler. I always have been. But, now, I just want to be addressed as 'she' or 'her'. Because I have always been Skyler, and Skyler has always been a she."

I began to think over scenarios and circumstances that can now be a reality, filling my stomach, and heart, with butterflies.

"So, like, people would say, 'I love Skyler, _she's_ so sweet!' or, 'Skyler, ugh, I love _her_.'"¬†I blushed and bit my cheeks as I beamed, feeling like an ignited rocket soaring up into the heavens. Charlie just laughed and grinned with pure delight, finding glee in my newfound happiness. "And whoever says those things, you would look at them and say, 'Yup, _she's_ my girlfriend.'"

"She most certainly is."

Those words coming out of Charlie's mouth almost made me scream with unbelievable joy. I bit my lip and squeezed my eyes shut, tightening my fists as my entire body received thrilling goosebumps. I was basically having a seizure caused by too much excitement. I wanted to get up and jump and dance around the room. I don't think I've ever felt this kind of happiness before. It was on another level.

"It's funny, I... I was so afraid of telling people just because of what they'd think of me... I used to have such a big phobia of people thinking I was weird... or 'extra'... or delicate... All because of what I experienced in high school and college. I was scared that _this_ would make people think I was just being weird and unusual again, or... having some stupid identity crisis."

"Sky, nobody will think that. At least, nobody you truly care about. Friends accept friends, no matter what."

The final tear had, at last, rolled down my face as I smiled once again, feeling at peace after such a long period of unfathomable fear.¬†

_All the pain of the past. It was now gone within the blink of an eye._

"So, what's the plan?" Charlie questioned, teasingly poking at my exposed teeth from all the smiling. "How are you gonna go through the process of transitioning? Like, surgery, or..?"

The question had caught me off guard, but I had thought through it before so I knew my answer. "Uh... That _is_ an option... But for now, I just want to ease into it slowly. This is a big thing and I don't want to rush it. I don't feel like I have to change my body to feel more feminine, I'm fine with how I am now. It's not like I want to cut off my dick," I said with a laugh, making Charlie crack up as well. "I just want to wear the clothes I want to wear and be addressed the way I wanted to be addressed." Charlie nodded his head, agreeing with every single statement I was making. "...But, I've done the research and I think HT will be helpful, so I might start doing that."

"What's HT?"  

"This thing called Hormone Therapy. I don't know much about it yet, but I, sort of, get the gist. Basically, they manage my hormones and put 'stuff' into me to make me feel more... feminine, I guess? To make me feel more at home within my own body."

"Whatever makes you feel comfortable, Sky, I'm in full agreement. I'm on your side. I always will be." Charlie touched the tip of his snout to mine, flashing a mischievous smirk. "I'm all in, baby."¬†

We both giggled breathlessly.

"Will you be there, with me, when I spread the news? To everyone I love?"

"I'll be there, every step of the way."

"...God, what am I gonna tell my parents..? Do you have any idea how I do this?"

"Just be open, Sky. Just talk. And everyone will understand."

"Are you sure?"

"If not, then I always will."

"...You know, this feels like the start of something really, really good."

"How come?"

"...Because I don't feel sad anymore... I think I've finally grown up, Charlie."

"...So have I."

\~~~

## Charlie

Hearing, sight, touch, smell, and taste.

All five of my senses returned to me as my eyelids slowly cracked open.¬†

It started with hearing. The sound of birds singing and chirping sweet tunes along with the crashing of dawning waves, far, far in the distance, rang gently in my ears.

Then, sight came back to me, next. The first thing I saw after my blurred vision was restored was the rectangular-shaped ray of sunlight, hitting the walls, formed by the morning sun peeking through the box-like frame of the glass windows. My peripheral vision began to expand, and soon, I saw the ceiling, the bedside table, the lamp, the digital clock reading '7:38 AM', and finally, the baby blue and pastel pink tufts of fur that belonged to the snoozing feline, who was encased within my embrace.

Next, touch. My arms were wrapped around her, spooning her in the same position that we drifted to sleep in last night.¬†

Then, smell. I breathed in the air around me, the sweaty, musty scent of last night clogging up my nostrils. Inhaling and exhaling the oxygen, feeling began to return to the rest of my numbed-from-sleep body, putting me back in control.

And finally, taste. Nothing worth mentioning could be detected on my tongue. But, I wanted nothing more than to kiss Skyler repeatedly and taste her over and over again. That sweet, sweet sugary flavor of her lips. I could never forget it.

Not wanting to do anything but stay with the love of my life from here on, I snuggled my face into the back of her head, hiding my eyes from the blinding light, generated by the sunlit room. I began to kiss her fur, my thirst for her unquenched.

She grunted and began to wake up, going through the same resurrection process that I had gone through. The vigorous lust-filled activities of last night had caused our morning to be much more exhausting, but those special memories of everything we had done were enough for us to know it was worth it.

Last night would live on in our heads until possibly the end of time. In fact, that entire day would go down in the monumental history of our relationship.

If only we had known that my 24th birthday would change our lives forever.

It was now the morning after. And there was already so much to do with these new feelings. These new memories.

These new freedoms.

Skyler and I had finally reached what we perceived to be 'adulthood'.

At first, it was scary. But now, it's exciting.

At least we don't have to spend it alone.

  

Skyler squirmed uncomfortably in the bed, stretching her limbs out slowly and with ease. She whimpered softly as she extended her arms, yawning rather adorably.

Lazily, I sat up in the bed, looking down at Skyler as she rolled onto her back, her weary eyes locking onto me. The sunlight from the balcony windows was hitting her directly, making her warm, sunset pink eyes glow brightly, along with the several, infinitesimal colorful strands that made up her vibrant coat of blue and pink fur. Getting to see her full, exposed body in the calm, unperturbed serenity of the morning was enough to bring peace to my soul for years to come. I didn't need coffee or any sort of caffeine to keep me awake, Skyler would always provide my early mornings with delight.

"There she is," I whispered, tenderly tracing my finger around her face, circling her eyes and tapping her nose gently. "Good morning, Cotton Candy."

"...Why did you have to bring that back?" She sleepily groaned with embarrassment, hiding her face with the sheets.

"Aw, c'mon, it's cute," I egged her on, leaning in for another kiss, only to be held back with an unexpected finger pressed firmly against my lips.

"Bad dog," Skyler mocked me with a devilish gaze, biting down on her tongue as she smirked erotically. Her fingers extended, grabbing the tip of my snout and clutching my entire jaw in her palm securely. I couldn't say a word. Her hold was like a muzzle on my, well, _muzzle_. "Look at you, strong husky bested by a 'cute' feline."

"Where'd all this confidence come from?" I muttered as Skyler slowly loosened her grip, instead using her paw to promiscuously caress my cheek. I took the opportunity to climb over her, my tall figure looming over Skyler to enforce dominance. "What happened to sweet, little, innocent Skyler?"

"What, I'm not allowed to act sexy?" Sky laughed, letting go of my face as I grabbed her wrist, pressing it down into the bed.

"Who said it was an act?" I smirked, claiming my well-deserved kiss before she could hold me back again. "...You're hot as fuck, don't get it wrong," my muffled voice flirted in-between smooches.

"Hm, just wait until I get new clothes," Skyler giggled, rolling her eyes. "According to what Becca and Claire say, you won't last a minute when they decide to dress me."

"Mmm, I can barely keep my hands to myself _now_," I slurred my words, pressing my body up against Skyler's. "I can't wait for this new era."

"Before we get there," Skyler teased, making my insides churn with desperation. Pressing her paw to my chest, she pushed me back and warded off any more desirable touching. "I think we should take a shower, first."

"Good idea," I smirked, lifting myself off of her and climbing over to the opposite side of the bed with eagerness. "I'll heat up the water."

After jumping off of the mattress excitedly, my destination set for the bathroom, I heard Skyler call for me from behind: "Charlie, wait‚Äî"

I spun around and looked back at Skyler, who was sitting up in the bed with a wincing expression on her face. She looked like she was in pain.

"What's wrong?" I asked.

"...I can't move my legs..." she admitted, flustered beyond belief.

A diabolical smirk had slowly made its way onto my face as I stared at the defenseless, weakened feline. "...Hm, I must've done something to ya," I taunted, approaching the bed again and scooping her out from under the covers, carrying her, bridal-style.

"Onward, my liege," she joked with a royal English accent, pointing towards the door to the bathroom. "To the bathhouse!"

"Yes, my queen," I played along, carrying Skyler to the shower.

We both wheezed with unending laughter.

# 40. TRANSITIONING PERIOD

## ACT IV**:** THE SEARCH FOR THE END

\~~~

## Skyler

### JULY

_Napping during the day is something I rarely get to do because of busy schedules and unending workloads, but when I do actually get the chance, it's probably the nicest thing in the world._

_I've been doing it a lot more recently, not just because the stressful stockpile of things to do has lightened, but because I've felt at peace enough to take my mind off of things and just rest._¬†

_Ever since Charlie's birthday last month, things have been a lot better. I don't know how long it will last, but I might as well ride the high while it's still kickin'._

_And that means taking breaks and deserving naps whenever I feel like it. Like right now._

A gentle tap on the shoulder had been the thing to disturb my peaceful sleep. Waking up, my eyes slowly de-blurred and settled on the person standing patiently by the bedside, awaiting my response.

"Sky..?" The voice had called, muffled and at a distance. I wasn't fully awake yet, so whoever was trying to bring me back to consciousness; they're gonna have to wait.

"Hey, leave her alone," another voice hissed, even further away as if they weren't in the room and, instead, calling from the hallway. "Let her sleep."

"But doesn't h‚Äî_she_ have to leave in a bit?" The closer voice stammered over their words.

"She has an hour. It's a long drive from here to California. Let her sleep."

The other voice had disappeared, but the faded silhouette in front of me did not move a muscle. Their face slowly came into focus, along with the familiar black, tan, and white patches of fur on their face.

They whispered into my ear. "...Clouds?"¬†

I squinted my eyes and breathed in heavily through my nostrils. Every time I wake up, my lungs feel like they're sinking or being weighed down by some heavy object.

"Hey, Cal," I mumbled groggily, rubbing my eyes with the backside of my paw, sniffling and clearing my throat. My eyes burned from the sensation of air hitting them after my eyelids had been shielding them from the atmosphere for the past hour.¬†

The image of my childhood bedroom formed around me as I returned to my senses, reminding me that I was home for the time being. It was still strange seeing how empty it was, since all my stuff was either thrown away or moved to California. I had promised to visit my family last month, so here was me finally doing that. But, sadly, the brief vacation had ended today.

Calico dropped to his knees, reaching my level on the mattress, his paws gripping the edge of the bed. "You leave in an hour. You got to get up and get ready and get all your things packed and... you gotta hurry."

"Wow, I didn't think you'd be _this_ eager to get me out of the house," I teased, lying on my back and stretching my limbs feebly.¬†

"I'm upset that you're leaving me again," Cal grumbled, sitting on the floor with an attitude, his back against the bedframe.

"_You_ were the one that convinced me to move in with Charlie," I reasoned.

"I thought you'd stay for the Fourth of July. We were gonna watch the fireworks..."

"Yeah, well, me and my friends had plans to celebrate the Fourth of July together months ago, so I can't just skip out on them. I was here for the _First_ of July, if that helps," I chuckled, only for Cal to go quiet.¬†

I sat up from the bed, my strength slowly returning to my limbs. "Hey... I'm sorry that our vacation was so short."

"It's summer. You should be able to hang out longer," he snapped.

"Yeah, well, when you're an adult," I yawned and straightened my back, "summer doesn't get you a two-month-long break."

"That's stupid. Adults deserve breaks as well. They're under just as much pressure as students."

"I couldn't agree more," I scoffed. Calico wouldn't look back at me, no matter how hard I tried to comfort him verbally. _Just like every growing, pre-pubescent teenager, the older Calico gets, the moodier he becomes. I wonder what he'll be like in two years once he hits high school?_¬† "Look... when you graduate, we'll be able to see each other as much as we want. You've got a few more years, bud. You think you can do it?"

"Why'd you have to move so far away?"

"I wanted to live with Charlie."

"Why'd you pick him over us?"

"...Cal, when you fall in love, you'll understand that not everything you do has to be for the sake of others. Choosing to do what feels best for _you_ is what comes first in the real world. That's one of the many things I had to learn when I became an adult. Putting my own stuff first. But, that doesn't mean I love you any less."

"She's right," Charlie entered the room along with my mother, the two of them carrying laundry baskets, messily filled with some of my mom's old clothes that haven't seen the light of day for years.

Calico stood up, staggered by their sudden intrusion.

"Cal, hon, I told you not to wake your sister," my mom reproached, sitting with Charlie at the edge of my bed, setting the baskets of clothes down on the floor in front of them. Calico rolled his eyes and crossed his arms, pacing around the room with irritation. "When we get older, sweetie, we have to make choices that not everyone will be okay with. I had to make choices, your dad had to, Sky did, and you will, too."

"What's this?" I asked, crawling to the edge of the bed and peeking behind both Charlie and Mom's shoulders. They were reaching into the basket and taking out several articles of vintage, predominantly female outfits, and folding them neatly.¬†

Charlie kissed my cheek as he carefully ordered the clothes into a tidy stack on the floor. "You're finally awake," he smiled, making me blush. _Even though we've been dating for basically four years, every little thing between us excites me in the same exact way as it did when we first started our relationship._

"These are my old clothes," Mom answered my question, mid-fold. "I thought, maybe, since I don't use them anymore, _you_ could borrow them. For your new wardrobe."

"I'm still having a hard time adjusting to this," Cal voiced his opinion from the back corner of the bedroom.

"Cal," my mom sternly warned.

"It's fine, I didn't expect him to just _ease_ into this," I whispered into her ear.

"I'm not saying I don't like it, I'm just saying I'm having a tough time," Cal explained, still a little moody.

"You'll get used to it, Cal," Charlie looked back at him assuredly. "This transitioning period is gonna be hard to adjust to‚Äîfor a lot of people, not just you‚Äîbut as long as you try your best, if not for you, but for your sister, then it'll slowly start to get easier."

Charlie's eyes shifted from Calico over to me, making my face burn red with glee. Charlie promised to always stay by my side, and so far, he's been my biggest supporter. There was no one I could've trusted more.

"Fine, whatever," Cal rolled his eyes, storming out of the room.

Looking back at the empty doorway, my brows began to furrow as a sense of disappointment weighed deeply in my core. Of all the people I feared coming out to, Cal was the one person I had the least doubt in. His struggles were fair, but it still upset me.

Charlie's paw touched mine, sending me a wave of warmth and comfort. I looked into his sympathetic eyes and nodded, then shifted my sights to the blankets of the bed underneath me. My smile began to fade.

I felt my mom's hand on my shoulder. "...Hey, he's just mad that you're leaving again and he's taking it out on you. _And_ this transition."

"I'll go talk to him," Charlie offered, setting down the folded T-shirt in his paws onto the stack. His paw lightly grazed my shoulder as he sat up from the bed. He politely absconded from the room, giving me one last look of comfort before leaving.

"You're lucky to have such an understanding boyfriend," my mom chuckled. I scooted forward and took Charlie's spot, my legs hanging over the edge. I reached into the basket of clothes and began to fold them.

"I don't know why I was so scared of telling you guys," I admitted, enveloping a pair of pants in on itself. "...I guess I was mostly afraid of being treated differently."

"Differently, how?"

"Differently, as in... I'm _obviously_ trans to you guys, and... it's clear that you know and you're trying to tiptoe around the fact that I don't want to be judged so you don't upset me." Mom just simply listened and nodded her head. "I just want it to feel like I was a girl all along."¬†

My fingers brushed against the soft fabric of one of the shirts. I brought it close to my face, my nose detecting the familiar scent of my mother. _I'd definitely feel the most comfortable wearing these clothes._

"How have we been doing so far?" Mom questioned me, nudging me on the shoulder. "Any comments for us? Any areas that need improvement?"

"Apart from Cal's stubbornness," we both then laughed softly, "You guys have been doing good."

"I'm glad, Sky," Mom whispered, leaning in and kissing my forehead. "I'm glad that _you_ know what _you_ are. A lot of people never find that out."

I turned my head, facing my caring mother. The loving expression on her face and the gentle petting of my head was enough to make those previous doubts go away.¬†

Calico _will_ grow to understand. I know he will.¬†

"...Do you think Dad is a little... disappointed?" I wondered aloud as Mom continued with her folding. I was shy to admit it.

"What are you talking about?" My mother asked, tilting her head at me.

"I dunno..." I resumed the process of folding as well. "...He tried _so_ hard to raise me into the strong, fearless man he's always wanted me to be." I paused and thought about every moment I had with him as a kid. "...I feel like he's always wanted that father-son relationship with me."

"He has Calico, Sky," Mom reassured me. "...And besides, I know I've never told you this, but... he's always wanted a daughter, too."

Another smile made its way onto my face without my permission.

"But, daughter, son, _whatever_ you are to him," Mom grasped my shoulder firmly, allowing for us to make real, sincere, eye contact, "you are _still_ his child. And you are _still_ mine. It doesn't matter what _gender_ you came out as, as long as you came out of _me_, you're my child."

I broke out into laughter after hearing those words, hiding my face with embarrassment. Mom laughed along with me, caressing my back with her paw, making me feel as safe and as comfortable as possible. _She didn't need to. I already was._

"Is Dad still resting?" I asked, "Can I go see him?"

"You know you can," Mom smiled, nudging my chin with her finger. I shooed her hand away.

\~~~

I walked down the famous corridor of various painted doors, which never failed to smack me upside the head with nostalgia. Reaching the end of the hallway, I grabbed the door handle to Mom and Dad's room and went inside. There was nothing that interesting about my parents' bedroom, apart from a few hung-up abstract paintings and a messy floor, scattered with books, files, and loose clothing. Opening the door, I found my dad resting cozily under the blankets of his and Mom's queen-sized bed, but what I did not expect to find was Charlie, sitting in an armchair beside the bed, indulging in conversation with my father.¬†

It seemed as though he and Dad were in the middle of a serious discussion, but judging from the seemingly happy expressions on their faces, it was something good. The moment I had entered the room, though, they had gone completely silent like deer caught in the headlights.

"Hey, sweetheart," Charlie greeted me with another giant, toothy smile.

"What's going on in here?" I curiously questioned, awkwardly shifting my way inside the room, reaching the foot of Dad's bed.

"Just talkin'," Dad shrugged it off as I approached Charlie in the chair.

"Where's Cal?" I leaned in to ask him, my paw resting on his shoulder as he looked up at me from the armchair.¬†

"Tricky lil' dude locked his door. I'm gonna have to find another way in, whether by force or by reason," Charlie joked sarcastically as he rose to his feet, using it as an excuse to respectfully give me and my dad our space. As he passed by, he gently grabbed my face and swiftly kissed my forehead before heading for the door.

"Don't chop it down with an ax, Jack Torrence," I teased as he made his exit, responding with a stifled laugh while shutting the door.

Once we were alone, I scratched my neck and awkwardly spun around to face my bedridden father. He gave me his usual cheeky smile, the one he's always put on for display when in times of discomfort or sadness. Dad would always cheer me up, even when I was at my lowest. I hated seeing him like this, sick and suffering, but today he was doing better than usual. He's been better than usual for a while now.

"How you feelin'?" I nervously asked, blowing air out through my mouth as I said it. Sitting on the edge of the bed, I looked back at him from over my shoulder. He just shrugged and rolled his eyes as an answer, making me laugh. "What were you and Charlie talking about?"

"Oh, you know... stuff," my dad hesitated, his voice rasping with age and exhaustion. His eyes shifted around the room, landing on the nightgown I was just wearing to bed. "Is that Mom's?"

"Oh‚Äîyeah." I looked down at the gown and pressed my paws to the silky fabric. I had forgotten I was wearing it. "Mom's giving me all of her old clothes. And pajamas."

"Your mom dressed _gorgeously_ when we were your age," Dad chuckled, reminiscing on the past. "I'm sure you'll carry on the tradition."

"Yeah, well, I was six or seven when you guys were my age, so I sort of remember."

Dad smiled again, but couldn't find the ability to laugh. He just stared at the blankets, which covered the lower half of his body. What I said must've struck a nerve, but I knew he wasn't upset with me. He never was.

_Sometimes, in moments like this, I realize how lucky I am to have a family that loves me. A family that's here for me. A home with pleasant memories. A childhood full of warmth and love._

_And it makes me feel so much pain for Charlie._

_There are times where I wish I could somehow give him the comfort of my past. Even if my upbringing wasn't always perfect, at least I had people to confide in when I was in pain. Charlie had no one. There's nothing I can do to change what has already been done._

_The past will always be set in stone._¬†

"...Dad?" I spoke up, staring at the carpeted floor.

"Yes, Sky?" I heard his voice echo from behind me.

"...Do you ever wish you did things differently?" My fingers clenched the edge of the mattress. "Do you ever wish you raised me in a different way?"

"...Where's this coming from, Skyler?" My dad attempted at kindred words.

"...Do you ever wish I was different?" My father was dead quiet. "...Like, If you had the chance to go back and alter the past so that I would end up... not like _this_... would you take it?"

"Skyler..." The bed shifted as my father sat up straight to get closer to me. "...Why would I do that?"

"I just feel..." I bit my cheeks and took a deep breath. "I _know_ that you and Mom love me... but, there are times where I feel like you would rather have me a different way... And I know that you wouldn't, or at least, you'd¬†_say_ that you wouldn't, but... I just imagine this dumb scenario where, I don't know,¬†_God_¬†or some stupid angelic figure comes to you both and gives you the power to make me 'normal'... and you'd do it."

My father had gone silent. I didn't know if it was because of shock... or disbelief... _or guilt._

"I know that you love me... but I feel like you'd change me if you had the opportunity."

"...Skyler, I wouldn't _dare_ take that opportunity," my father declared.

Staring at the wall ahead of me, I couldn't bear turning around and facing him. "...You wouldn't?"

"Sky..." My father's hand cautiously landed on my shoulder, sending a chill down my spine. "When your mom was pregnant with you, I... We were only seventeen. We had _no idea_ what we were doing. But, when she had you, I... made a promise to myself. I promised that, no matter who you turned out to be, you would _always_ be my kid. And you are. So, whether you're my son... or my daughter... you will always be my¬†_family_. And I promised myself that, no matter what happened in your life down the line, I would _always_ protect you... and care for you... and love you... as _my_ child."¬†

I couldn't see his face, but I knew that if I turned, I'd see a familiar, welcoming, loving expression. The slight whimper in his words had proved that everything he had said was with great emotion. He meant every word.

My eyes began to water, but thankfully, I've become a bit more resistant to crying. I held it in with little effort, but there were still some other things that I just had to let out. I opened my mouth and continued: "...I've always had this fear of what your image for me was. I always feared that I'd never be able to become this... _strong, fearless man_ that you tried so hard to teach me to be... Every time I showed weakness, I was afraid that I was disappointing you. I was afraid that you were disappointed in _yourself_... for not raising me correctly."

"Sky... I don't regret _anything_." He made such a statement with so much confidence. "I wouldn't change a _thing_. I did everything I should've done for you, Sky. I was _here_, I was _present_, and even though there were times where I couldn't protect you like I promised I would... you withstood it all. _That_ was the strength I was trying to teach you. And, by God, you _learned_. You are _so much_ more stronger than you think, Skyler."

Slowly, I turned my head back over my shoulder, my eyes taking a bit longer to catch up. Once they had landed on my father's face, I could see how deeply emotional he had become. I rarely ever saw him cry. _Oddly enough, seeing it gave me a bit of comfort._

_Even the strongest people can be broken. But, their ability to stand back up is what gives them their strength._

A smile slowly made its way onto my face as I caved in, my body doing a complete 180¬∞, lunging for my father with arms wide open. Dad had accepted the embrace graciously, his arms wrapping around me and scooping me up as if I was a child again.

Dad had whispered into my ear: "I have _the_ most... creative... brilliant... talented... joyful... loving...¬†_strongest_ daughter in the world."

I could feel one of his tears hit my shoulder.¬†

And, in that moment, I knew exactly what he was thinking.

_He was so happy to be holding me right now... because it was proof that he had succeeded in his job of being a father._

_He had succeeded in raising me._

\~~~

**Charlie**

_"How are you, son?"_

"Cal, bud, let's talk for a bit," I called out politely as I stared at the text from my father on the phone screen, not really paying attention to what I was saying. My focus was set only on the message. Sitting up against Calico's door in the hallway, I contemplated opening the notification.¬†

But, suddenly, the surface I was leaning up against had miraculously given away, causing me to fall backward onto the carpeted floor, my head hitting the ground. Luckily, no injury had been dealt. Above me, Calico stared down at me with an annoyed glare. He had opened the door.

"Hey, dude," I greeted with an awkward smile. Cal just sighed, sucked his teeth, and sat down on his bed.

I got up from the floor and watched as Cal retreated to the middle of his bed, sitting with his arms and legs crossed. Not knowing exactly how to approach him, I stepped back and leaned my shoulder against the dresser on the opposite side of the room.¬†

I've rarely been in Calico's room, so it was a bit disorienting to finally view a part of Skyler's house that's always been hidden away. Every wall was a dark, night-sky blue, and the ceiling was littered with glow-in-the-dark star and moon stickers. He had a bunch of neon lamps and glowing action figurines all over the place, providing a cool, colorful atmosphere to the room. It was just as messy and cluttered as Skyler's room, but the Clawfields always had a way to make messy look good.

"Are you upset that I stole Skyler away from you?" I teased in an attempt to cheer him up, crossing my arms, smirking, and lifting an eyebrow.

"I'm not upset," Calico stated clearly and without hesitation, not bothering to look at me.  

"You seem upset, Cal."

"I'm not, I'm just processing."

"That's fine, but..." I started to shake my head as I shifted my footing, leaning my hip against the dresser instead, "...don't take your confusion out on Skyler, or anyone in general, okay? It's as hard for her as it is for you."

Cal rolled his eyes with annoyance, sighing deeply with frustration. "I'm... I'm _not_ confused.¬†_I_ was actually the one who talked to hi‚Äîher about the transition. _I_ was the one who gave Sky the idea. Before h‚Äîshe left us and went to live with you." The last sentence gave off a hint of resentment towards me.

"I thought you wanted her to go with me?"

Cal shook his head and sputtered, "I did... I wanted this for Sky, I did..." I could see the struggle in Cal's conflicted expression. "...But, it got so lonely without hi‚Äîher‚Äî_fuck!"_

"Woah, language," I chuckled. "You're pretty damn mature for thirteen."

Cal did not respond.

At a slow but heavy pace, he began to breathe in and out. His limbs started to tremble as he nervously tugged random strands of fur on the back of his head. He was now visibly disturbed, rubbing his neck with his paws rampantly as he let out small groans of exasperation. I stepped forward from the dresser, now concerned about the poor kid in front of me.

"Hey, Cal..?" I approached him carefully and dropped to my knees, resting my arms on the edge of the bed as I leaned in to talk to him. Cal just looked down at me with anxious, fretting eyes. From just a look, I could see all the fear and anguish bottled up inside of the frail little cat.¬†

It reminded me of how I would act when under similar pressures. I used that empathy to my advantage.

"...I know. Feeling alone is scary," I nodded my head, giving Cal the assurance needed to lower his guard down. "I... used to feel _so_ alone when I was your age, Cal. And sometimes, I still do. During these past few months, I've never felt _more_ alone in my problems."

_Am I really going to just spill all of this shit out onto a little kid?_

_Maybe... it's what Cal needs in this moment._

_Maybe, it's what I need, too._

"I had this idea in my head that no one could understand what I was going through and no one could fix my issues. I thought that I had to do it all myself. But, Cal, there's a difference between _fact_ and _feeling_. And even though we _feel_ alone, doesn't mean we truly _are_ alone."

Cal, though the anxiety was still present in his eyes, lowered his hands from the back of his neck and leaned in ever-so-slightly, telling me that he was listening to my words with valuable interest. I took the opportunity.

"I know you've always believed that Sky was the _only_ one who understood you... but that's not true. There are so many people out there in the world who can help you, Cal... You just have to be willing to accept their help."

Cal opened his mouth, showing his teeth, trying to find the right words to respond with. He sniffled and exhaled sharply, his eyes dancing around the room. "But... how can I trust them? They aren't Skyler. They don't know me that way. How will they understand me? How will they help me?"

"...You're afraid of being seen as weak or different... right?"

Cal didn't answer, but the look in his eyes told me everything I needed to know. _I've seen those same eyes in the mirror every morning for twenty-four years._ I bit my bottom lip and shifted my eyes down to the starry-night blanket that was laid out over his bed.

My muzzle fell open and the words just came out. "_I_ was _always_ afraid of being seen as vulnerable... Skyler was, I'm guessing, the only person you believed to ever see you as more than that?" Peering up at him again, Cal nodded reluctantly. "Yeah, well... I didn't have a friend like Skyler growing up.¬†I didn't think _anyone_ saw me as more than weak and vulnerable. And I wanted to prove everyone wrong, so badly. So, I would bottle up all my feelings to appear stronger, but... it only made me feel more alone."

"...But, you're not, you... You have Sky, you have friends, you... You're not alone."

"Neither are you, Cal," I shrugged, stating the obvious. "You have Sky, yes, but you also have your mom and your dad, who, might I add, are _really good_ parents. I mean, _really, really good_. God, I would _kill_ to have parents like yours. And, I know you don't tell me about these things, but from what I've heard from Skyler, you also have a few friends. Calico, you are _so_ far from being alone. It took a while for _me_ to accept that, because honestly, I was scared of being seen as an emotional person, so I hid away. And it made me _so angry,_ dealing with all those feelings by myself. And I took my anger out on those who didn't deserve it."¬†

The worry had slowly started to leave Calico's face.

"...I took my anger out on Sky, Cal. I've never felt more ashamed of myself. I'm begging you not to make that same mistake."

Cal, now quiet as a mouse, looked away from me and hid his face. It grew silent in the room, but it didn't feel uncomfortable or strange in the slightest. I could tell Cal was going through some stuff so I decided to respect his silence.

I leaned in further and spoke softly so as to not disrupt the quiet. "...Just help your sister out with this. She needs you right now. Alright?"

Cal nodded his head, staring at the wall to his right, facing away from me. I nodded my head as well, even though I knew he couldn't see, and stood up from the floor. Turning to leave the room, I glanced at Cal one last time, assuring myself that Sky's little brother would be okay.

Swiftly, I tiptoed out of the room and closed the door softly behind me. While turning to face the hallway ahead, the sight of Olympia leaning against the wall next to Calico's door had unexpectedly given me a slight jolt.

Noticing that I had jumped a little out of fear, Olympia reached out to me with apologetic arms, whispering, "Oh, sorry, hon, I didn't mean to scare you!"

"It's okay," I laughed breathlessly, keeping my voice down. Olympia snickered as well, placing her hands on my shoulders and patting them. "How's the folding going?"

Dropping her hands to her sides, Olympia had gone quiet, just like Cal had done. But, instead of wearing a face of anxiety, she smiled lightly with an expression full of gratitude. She then turned around, gesturing for me to follow as we walked back down the hallway, returning to Skyler's room.¬†

"I overheard the conversation..." Skyler's mother told me as we made our way back into the bedroom. "Thank you for talking to him."

Olympia sat back down on the bed, resuming with the folding. I did the same, grabbing another article of clothing, not knowing what to make of the situation. "It's... It's no problem, Olympia, I..."

"...I'm sorry about everything that's been happening to you..." Olympia spoke up as she placed a green cardigan on the stack of clothes for Sky. "...Me and Thompson, just so you know, we‚Äîwe're here for you as well."¬†¬†

Olympia rested her paw on my shoulder. I looked into her eyes, feeling the warmth radiate from her gaze.

The type of warmth that could only come from a mother.

"You're a part of this family, Charlie. You never have to be afraid."¬†

I've always longed to hear those words. After a few seconds of intimate hesitation, Olympia set her eyes back on another article of clothing to fold, blurting out: "Look, I-I'm not trying to act as a 'replacement mother' or anything, but... if you ever need some sort of parental figure to turn to... Me and Sky's dad, we're never that far away."  

I've always seen Sky's family as my own. It was good to know that I was seen the same way by them. But, it would always remind me of the family that I didn't have.

"...Thank you, Olympia..." I touched her shoulder as she had done to me. "Seriously, thank you _so much_ for _everything_ you've given me..." I thought back to the text message. "But, I already have a parent, and... I think I'm gonna try to put him first. I just have to find a way to... be open to loving and trusting again."

Olympia smiled once more, receiving my answer with complete acceptance. She leaned in and gently kissed my forehead as if I were one of her feline children. It felt good to know that, even if my own mother was long gone, I'm still capable of being loved as a son.¬†

"You're a good man, Charlie," she told me. "Thank you... for everything you gave to my Skyler."

She went back to her folding.

_I no longer have a mother. I have a family instead. And I'm fine with that._

_If this is all I get, I'm fine with it._

  

"There is one thing I'd like to ask, though," I proposed nervously.¬†"...I just asked Skyler's dad about this, too, so he knows about it, in case you were wondering."

Olympia put down the clothing and maintained eye contact with me. "What's up?"

"I wanted to... ask you for permission."

"...To do what?"

\~~~

The sun setting on the horizon behind me, reflected in the rearview mirror almost blinded my vision, but it felt fitting on this peaceful, summer afternoon. All the windows and shiny surfaces of my car were glistening in that orange glow, along with the dewy blades of grass, populated by tiny, zippy clusters of bugs, next to the twig-infested tar road ahead. The summer heat was sending small rivulets of sweat down my forehead, but in a peaceful, rural area like this, it felt refreshing and tranquil.

Sitting in the driver's seat of my car with the engine running, I looked back over my shoulder and watched as Sky put the last of her luggage into the trunk, reaching up and shutting it firmly. The car was parked in the street, just in front of the Clawfield's house, where Olympia and Thompson stood on the porch to see us off, waving goodbye.

Sky was all dressed and ready to go home. She had a cute little white fleece dress with a small sunflower pattern stitched into the hip. Something about Skyler finally being able to dress, act, and look the way she wanted made her so much more beautiful to me. Skyler was a gorgeous, attractive, luminous young woman. I've never been happier with a girl like her.

Sky made her way around the other side of the car, grabbing the handle of the door. I smiled at her through the car door window, swooning at her beauty, but before she could open it and come inside, she stopped, distracted by something over by the house.

Turning my head back over to the left, I watched as Calico ran out of the house and jumped down the steps of the porch, racing for his sister. Sky darted back around the car after seeing him emerge and ran to him, scooping him up into a large, cozy hug.

In the silence of the car, I watched as she held Calico by his shoulders and began to say meaningful things to him. I couldn't hear any of it as I was stuck inside, but from the look on Calico's face, I could tell it was heartfelt and reassuring. I didn't need to know what she said.

Calico nodded as Sky brushed her paw through the fur on his head, pulling him back into one final hug. It lasted a couple of seconds, but once it was over, Cal had accepted it was time for Sky and me to leave.

He ran back to Olympia and Thompson and joined his parents in waving goodbye. Sky waved as she made her way back to the car while I waved from the window.

Sky climbed inside, sitting in the passenger seat.

I looked over at her.

"Ready to go?"

Sky looked over at me, her eyes glistening.

She nodded.

We both fastened our seatbelts.¬†

I pulled out my phone, intending to open the Google Maps application, but I was met with my dad's message notification once again.¬†

Skyler reached into the back of the car for something, allowing me to text back. My thumb hovered over the notification, about to press it.

But, before my thumb could hit the screen, my phone had vibrated with a _new_¬†text notification.

One from Claire.

Skyler, with the book she was trying to claim from the back in her hands, noticed that something was up.

"Something wrong?" She leaned in, put off by my hesitance.

"Claire texted," I told her, reading the message, word for word. "She... thinks she found Becca."

  

# 41. THE CRIMINAL

\~~~  

## Becca

_"Rebecca Colin Seabrooke, the Criminal."_

I woke up in a puddle of sweat.

My body was sprawled out in an uncomfortable position on the sack I called a bed in the back of my van. Pushing myself up from under the raggedy pile of blankets, I cleared my scratchy throat and took a few breaths in, filling my heavy lungs. My hair was all out of sorts and my limbs felt fragile.¬†

From the floor of the dimly lit van, I stared up at the cardboard-covered windows of the two back doors of the vehicle; a ray of sunlight peeking through one of the holes, illuminating every speck of dust migrating through the air. With my arms pressing against the bed beneath me, supporting my back, I stared around the dark, drafty interior of the van.

Poor ol' Red Velvet was a mess.¬†

Empty take-out boxes collectively piled atop one another in a measly stack in the corner; the fold-out desktop surface that came attached to the walls of the van was littered with cigarette buds and ashes from a lopsided ashtray; my phone and laptop awkwardly rested somewhere hidden under the covers of my bed; and the stickers and decorations I'd adorned the walls with were now beginning to lose their glitz and glamour.¬†

_This was my home. My messy, ruined home._

My head was beginning to sting‚Äîmy cruel punishment for last night's drinking‚Äîthe hangover beginning to set in. I've dealt with morning aftermaths like this many times before, it wasn't new to me. It was far too familiar.

I spun around in the bed, hearing the bones in my body crack from the sudden motion. With my outstretched arm now dealing with a grueling pain, I groaned as I reached for a spilled tin of Tylenol on the floor, along with a half-drunken, room-temp bottle of water.¬†

I held the unusually light tube of pills up to my eye, peering through the hole. To my dismay, it was empty. I tossed the vacant tin against the wall, hissing, "bloody hell", as I cracked off the cap of the water bottle, chugging the liquid and quenching my dry, thirsty throat. Throwing the now-empty, crinkled plastic bottle into the trash pile, I tossed the blankets off of me and searched the sweaty sheets for my phone.

Once my scampering paws had obtained the device, I attempted to turn it on, only to be met with the low battery screen.

Sighing deeply with frustration, I stumbled to exit the van. I didn't even need to put on any clothes as I was already dressed in last night's outfit. I even slept with my shoes on.

Kicking open the back doors of the van, the piercing gleam of daylight blinding me outright, I squinted my eyes as I attempted to make my way out of the vehicle. My shoes hit the concrete floor, the humid, polluted LA atmosphere hitting me with a nauseating heat stroke. Allowing my eyes to adjust to the sunlight, the vision of my surroundings returned.¬†

I was parked exactly where I've been for the past month or so. On the roof of the parking complex. The one I took Claire to a while ago.¬†

The view from the top wasn't as glamorous as it was at night, but it did please the eye. I could see busy Californian roads, stocked with traffic, even at such an early time in the morning. Buildings with vibrant posters stood in the distance, towering over the crowded highway, leading to the smoky, silver-gilded metropolis of Los Angeles in the distance as if it were a red carpet pathway, directing the drivers toward a promised lifetime of 'fame' and 'fortune'.

_Yeah, alright._

I scoffed and reached into the pocket of my jeans, pulling out a spare cigarette and a lighter. It wouldn't help with the migraine, _or_ the aching throat, but I did have the craving for a smoke right about now.¬†

Taking in the cemented view as I puffed the cig in my jaw, I turned around, using the sides of the van to aid me in standing upright, and walked towards the door of the driver's seat. The parking lot itself was fairly crowded with vehicles, yet, devoid of _actual_ people. _Probably for a good reason._ I stared at myself in the side-view mirror, taking in my ugly sight. My fur was all cluttered and unkempt, my clothes were loose and wrinkly, and my face was devoid of a happy attitude.

I opened the car door and reached for my portable phone charger, which lay on the floor of the van near the gas pedals. I plugged my phone in and put the two items back into my pockets, waiting for it to charge back up. Taking the cigarette out of my mouth, I flung it in a random direction with just two fingers as I began to make distance from the van.

\~~~

Reaching a CVS on the ground floor of the parking complex, I went inside and immediately searched for the Tylenol. Paying at the counter with a few spare bucks found in my bra, I took shelter in the bathroom and screwed off the lid of the container, popping a pill and washing it down with the tap water provided by the sink.¬†

With my arms cradled around my legs, sitting on top of the toilet lid, I stared at the screen of my phone as it came back to life. As per usual, thousands of notifications were blowing up my phone. Some from people online, some from friends and family, and _a lot_ from the usual group.¬†

Skyler, Charlie, and Jonathan were all attempting to reach out, but _Claire_ was the one doing the most work.

_I thought I had said I needed space._

Skimming through all the notifications, I searched for the ones I actually felt like answering.¬†

That's when I saw the text from Kendall.

_'hey, im sorry, but i couldn't stay the night. u seemed troubled and u passed out when we got to the van so i just sorta left. i know ur only looking for hookups rn, but seriously, u seem rlly bad. u were drunker than normal n acting out n i was kinda uncomfortable. we can meet up again when u have things sorted out if u want, but for now i think u should just focus on urself and maybe get things together. sorry.'_

I reread the text a few times before opening the message thread. With my fingers hovering over the keyboard, I thought about how I might respond.

I don't even remember going out with her last night.¬†I don't even remember what she _looked_ like.

_'Drunker than normal'? Have we gone out before?_

_How many girls have I been with in the past month?_

My fingers found their way across the keyboard, typing and sending back the simple reply of: 'ok sorry'.

Scrolling through the contacts on my phone, I could see all the people I was missing texts from. Without having to open them, I viewed all the recent messages they had sent me, skimming over each and every one.

Charlie, with four missed texts and two missed calls: _'hey what's going on? we're worried'._  

Skyler, with five missed texts and three missed calls: _'Whatever's happening, I trust that you'll be okay. Stay safe, Bec'_

Jonathan, with seven missed texts and five missed calls: _'I forgive you. Come back to us'._

Claire, with twenty-one missed texts and fifty-three missed calls: _'Becca, please come back. We love you so much. Come home'.  
_

  

My eyes watered, the phone screen growing less and less visible as it drowned in tears. I squinted my eyes shut before any drops could fall, losing my grip on the phone, which fell out of my hands. I heard it hit the floor.¬†

My head sunk into my knees as I cradled myself, rocking back and forth, cowering away from the reality I'd succumbed to. I felt the world around me disappear as I sulked in the aching loneliness that reigned deep in my heart. I began to cry, unable to face the person I had become.

_I feel like a villain... or a monster. Or a criminal. I knowingly push away the only people that have ever loved me. I hurt myself only to hurt others._

_All I've ever known is rejection. I see it in everything. Even in the kindest of words._

\~~~

Sitting on the roof of my van, I scarfed my way through a tub of Ben & Jerry's ice cream with nothing but a spoon as the sun slowly set on the horizon of my daily parking lot view. The red and golden headlights, swiftly moving up and down the individual lanes and separate roads below, sparkled in the vision of my watery eyes, glowing brighter with every second that passed as the sun crept behind the Earth.

I'd spent the entire day in my van, unable to do anything but sleep, wake, sleep, and wake. This has been a norm for the past month. It's usually what I did whenever I went into some sort of depression. It became a coping mechanism; just doing nothing and neglecting everything and everyone. I haven't changed.¬†

I've learned to seek solace in loneliness, even if it hurt to be alone. No matter how much I hated it, isolation was a part of me. I don't know how to function without it.

I sniffled, sucking on the metal rim of the spoon, licking it clean. Going in for another scoop, I found an empty tub; the ice cream all gobbled up, down to the very bottom of the container.¬†

I stared at the carton, devoid of the sugary sweet dessert. As a child, the sight of something as tasty as ice cream would only bring me joy. Now, I only see gluttony and shame.¬†

And even so, I'd still eat as if it were my last meal.

_I'm disgusting..._

There was a time when I was so afraid of rejection that I tried to change myself for acceptance in the most drastic of ways. I wanted to be adored so badly. Even if that meant starving and forcefully purging myself.

_It was a bad habit._ Almost as bad as the self-isolation.

But, it became _such_ a habit that the process mixed itself into _any_ kind of bad feeling I had, jumbling up my brain and rewiring my thinking.¬†

Every time I felt sad or lonely, I would turn to that horrible practice. I would force my fingers down my throat. I would do it so often that it became a hobby. I would end every day by engorging myself with as much food as possible, only to puke it all up afterward. I would even do it on days when I ate nothing. Instead of vomit, all that would come out was stomach acid.

It began to hurt.

I've left that habit, but the thought always comes back. Tempting me. It's like muscle memory.¬†

Whenever I'm the slightest bit upset, the temptation would come back as if it were a coded response. A scripted reaction.¬†

Staring at the bottom of the ice cream tub, I suddenly had the urge to just ram my hand straight down my throat.

I glared at my paw, clenching the edge of the carton.¬†

I raised it to my face, staring at my fingers, recalling every memory of my past experiences.

I knew exactly what to do and how to do it. It was hardwired into my brain.

  

_...What have I got to lose?_

_I've already pushed everything and everyone else in my life away..._

_I just want to feel something... anything... other than the loneliness..._

_Anything is better than loneliness._

_Even if it's pain._

  

"Becca?"

My head perked up instantly, startled by the sound of a familiar female voice, calling my name gently.¬†

The sun itself was now gone from the sky, only its signature, bright glow left behind in its place. I didn't want to look in the direction of where the voice came from. I just stared at the view and the horizon beyond it.

But then, "Becs?" came from the left, opposite to the first voice's right. This voice was different. It was familiar, but something felt off about it. It was more high-pitched and feminine than I remembered it originally being.

"Becca," another voice called, this one deep and masculine, coming from the right again; seemingly in close proximity to the first voice.

"Hey, Becca..." One last voice, another male. This one was also to the left, standing alongside the other feminine voice. "...Look at us."

Cautiously obeying the order, my head turned downward, my eyes shifting to view the people around me.

To the left were Charlie and Skyler, staring up at me on the van with worry and concern from the concrete floor of the parking complex roof. To the right, Jonathan and Claire stood in the same fashion.

_Four friends, worrying about one. I really did cause a lot of panic._

Squeezing my eyes shut, I sighed deeply, breathing out with a sense of hopelessness. My back slouched with guilt and remorse, my head sinking. It was as if I were a criminal caught red-handed. Having to be seen like this in front of my friends gave me nothing but utter embarrassment.

"...Hey, mates," I feebly whispered.

"Becca," Claire whimpered, on the verge of crying. "...We've been so worried‚Äî"

"How'd you find me?" I interrupted. My method of blocking out anything upsetting was simple: not letting the emotions of others get to me.

"...Claire knew this was one of your... spots," Jonathan answered for her. "...She wasn't positive, but... she had a feeling you were here."

"Is that because this is where I kissed her?" I blurted out, making Jonathan go silent. I couldn't see it, but I could feel Claire's head turn. Charlie looked over at Sky with subtle shock, seemingly the only person not caught up in the drama.

"Becca..." Sky attempted, taking a small step forward, placing her hands on the van. "...It was a mistake. _You_ know that. Everyone makes mistakes‚Äî_we've_ all made mistakes, believe me. _So many_ mistakes. But‚Äî"

"‚ÄîBut, what? Are you gonna lecture me on how I have to 'learn from my mistakes'? Like I'm in grade school again?" I snapped, unable to control my temper.

"Bec," Charlie joined in, "we've all made mistakes... and whether you learn from them or not... what you _really_ need to know is that... we have people, around us, who _understand_ our mistakes. People who don't persecute us for them. Instead, they help us heal."

"That's easy for you to say, you have Skyler," I interrupted once again. "And Skyler has you. And _you_," I turned to Claire, who was staring at me with this strange glimmer of regret, "You have Jonathan. Jonathan has you." I looked back at the horizon. "Who do _I_ have?"

"Becca, you have _us_," Jonathan pressed.

"It's not the same. You don't understand."

"Help us understand," Sky added, her arms reaching up for the top of the van, determined to scale it. Before I could respond, she had clumsily climbed her way up onto the roof of the vehicle, sitting beside me and placing her paw on top of mine. "We're listening."

The van shook under the weight of Claire as she made her way up as well, joining us two. She sat directly beside me, both her and Skyler sandwiching me between them. The three women of the group were together, and suddenly, I began to feel less alone.

I opened my mouth, trying to find the right words to say. "...You don't understand how it feels... to be the outlier in the friend group. For four fuckin' years."

"What makes you the outlier?" Claire questioned as if I were wrong for thinking it.

"What do you think, Claire?!" My eyes started to water once again. I stared back at the view, taking my sights off of them. "You guys... you seem to have everything figured out... With love... with your careers... with your _lives_... I feel so behind... I've waited so long to have what you guys have, I've waited _so long._ But nothing _ever_ works out for me..." My voice was beginning to break up. My body felt weaker by the second. "I just don't want to feel alone..."

"You aren't alone," Charlie stated as he climbed up the side of the van, becoming a part of the group.

"I _feel_ alone," I dejected, wiping my face.

"Doesn't mean you are," Jonathan responded, doing the same as Charlie, sitting on the edge in order for the five of us to fit.

"You don't get it!" I yelped, seemingly incapable of making them understand. "I don't care whether I'm _actually_ alone or not, it's the fact that I _feel_ alone! Because I'm not in the same place as you guys! I'm behind..! And that makes me feel so... _fucking isolated!_ And I hate it because I _choose_ to isolate myself... Because..." It all spilled out of my mouth like a waterfall. _It had been a while since I'd last been able to express my emotions. Truthfully._ "...Because I think I deserve it..."

"...Why would you deserve it?" Skyler asked, taken aback by my words.

"I don't know..." _But I did._¬†

The tears were now streaming gently down my face.

_Just talk, Becca._¬†

_For once in your life, stop closing yourself off._

"...I hate myself," I admitted, honestly and truthfully. "...I hate who I am... I hate the things I do... I hate the choices I make for myself... I hate the pain I put myself through... I hate the way I look, the way I dress, the way I present myself, the way I act in front of others, the way I try to find love..." I bit my lip, shaking my head frantically, overwhelmed by the situation. "I hate it... But, I just can't seem to change... I don't know any better... All I've ever known is how to isolate myself."

"...But you don't have to," Claire spoke below her breath, tenderly brushing a strand of hair out of my face and behind my ear. "You may feel isolated... You may feel behind... but Becca, we _all_ feel this way."

I tilted my head over at her, not fully gaining the point of her statement.

"You were right, Becs," Skyler placed her hand on my shoulder. I turned to face her. "You're not in the same place as us. You're in a different place, yes. But, _so are we._ We're all in different places, with our own issues, our own struggles, but the thing is... it isn't a race. It's not linear. _Nobody_ is ahead of anyone else. And _nobody_ is behind."¬†

Skyler then held her paws out, trying to come up with the right words to say. She paired her own dialogue with her hands in order to help me visualize the meaning.

"...It's like a giant board game. Except, we're not all competing against one another, no. We're a _team_." She nodded her head at all of us individually, holding her paws together, interlocking each of her fingers. "And we're not making our way towards any sort of finish line or goal, no, we're barely even playing. We're just trying to stay on the board. All of us. Because, believe me, there are _a lot of things_ trying to knock us off of it."

Skyler looked over her shoulder, making eye contact with Charlie.

"We all have individual issues that are trying to tip the board," she said, Charlie nodding at her in support. "But, you know what the best part is?"

"You have teammates on your side," Claire finished Skyler's sentence, wrapping her arm around my shoulders. Skyler smiled, pleased that Claire could carry on the speech.

"We understand, Bec," Jonathan spoke up, "Some of us have things and opportunities that others don't, and that can feel isolating at times. But, taking on the responsibilities of love and life means taking on burdens, too."

"We all suffer from something," Charlie muttered, seemingly thinking about something personal to him. "But, at least, we have people who are there, beside us, at every moment."

"Don't spend so much time focusing on what you don't have," Skyler lectured, "I know how badly you want love, I know how much it hurts without it... but prioritizing that pain will get you _nowhere_. Isolating and hurting yourself, over and over... Becca..." She grabbed my hand and squeezed it tightly. "If you want this, you have to be ready to fight for it. You can't close yourself off." She leaned in closer. "Focus on what you _do_ have, Becca. Focus on what is good, and you'll be able to find the fight in you."

"You have us, Becca," Claire chimed in, "You have _us_. And we love you. Unconditionally. You don't have to isolate yourself. Find that will to fight in _us."_

"We're always here to talk," Jonathan said, Charlie building on it with, "We're always here to _listen_."

"And we're always here to love you, no matter what," Skyler shook her head, "I promise you that, Becca. I _promise_ you."

"We're all hurting in some stupid way," Claire scoffed, tears running down her cheeks, "But we can hurt together."

"She's right. That's always the first step," Skyler agreed, grabbing Charlie's hand. "Sharing your pain. It may seem scary, but trust me, the love that is shared back to you will _always_ overpower the pain." The tips of Charlie's mouth curled slightly upwards with emotion. Skyler squeezed her boyfriend's paw even tighter.

Claire grabbed my other paw, along with Jonathan's, uniting us all in a simple hand-to-hand contact. She gave one last look of assurance to Jonathan, to which he mirrored back. "I promise you, if you need us to, we _will_ take on your pain," she swore, staring into my eyes. "We will listen and we will show you love‚Äîas much love as you need. We are not your friends. We're your _family_, Becca."

Skyler spoke once more: "If we can do it, you can do the same."

So did Claire: "We all have each other's backs. That's what family does."

So did Jonathan: "We're here for you, just as you are here for us."

So did Charlie: "We're united in pain... but we're also united in love."

  

So did I.

"...Okay," I whimpered, giving in. "Okay."

  

Claire immediately lunged for me, throwing her arms around my body and hugging me tightly.

_I guess this was her way of sharing her love with me._¬†

I accepted it, graciously, hugging her back.

_I missed being able to feel this type of way with someone._

Skyler joined in, sharing the love.

Jonathan and Charlie followed.

_I can't believe I ever thought I was alone..._

_I have to make things different from now on. I need to stop hiding._

We all stared at the view, the sky now pitch black, the stars gleaming and glistening in the endless, infinite, universal galaxy that stood above us. It was cosmically massive in size. The five of us were just specks in comparison, but the feeling was just as substantial. Possibly even bigger.

There we all were, together.

United in pain, in sorrow, in fear, but most importantly, in love. The one thing that overpowers all the rest.

I closed my eyes, my final tears parting, nothing but a smile left plastered on my face.

  

_I've found the love I've always wanted. Right here, right now._

_Things won't immediately get better. I know they won't. But I'll try better this time._

_From this moment on, I'll remain open._¬†

_Open to pain, and open to love._

  

_Thank you, Charlie, Jonathan, Skyler, Claire..._

_Thank you for understanding my pain._

_Love, Rebecca, the Criminal._

  

  

# 42. FIREWORKS

\~~~

## Charlie

Carefully, I fit the buttons of my white button-down t-shirt through the individual slots on the placket, one by one. My hands were a little shaky from nerves, but I was able to get the simple task done _and_ successfully wear a tie around my collar.

Dropping my hands to my sides, I looked up and stared at the reflection of myself in the mirror.¬†

I looked pretty good. I'd forgotten how it felt to have confidence, inside and out. It was nice to experience that kind of self-worth again.

Brushing my paw through the hair on my head, I made sure everything about my appearance was top-notch and shipshape. _I wanted to look good for tonight, not just for the Independence Day festival, but for what came afterward. I'd long prepared for and awaited this day._¬†

_And, right now, it feels like the best time, more than ever._¬†

_Because I finally feel so, so happy._

For the past month, everything has been... _pretty good._¬†Skyler and I have maintained our love; our relationship hasn't faltered since. We've never been stronger together before. She's been gaining a lot of success with her artwork lately and has been making a name for herself online. Post-production for the film I shot with Deno has wrapped up and is now being prepped for press and distribution. We've been handling ourselves well with both our careers and our personal lives, including our bonds with our friends and family. Recently, Skyler has been checking in on her family more, especially after our last visit, and Becca has been doing better as well. As for me, I've slowly worked up the courage to reconnect with my father again.

My phone on the bathroom sink counter had vibrated, driving me to pick it up. It was a text from Dad.

_"Good luck, son. I know you can do it."_

A very faint grin had crossed my face. After a bit of hesitation, I texted back.

_"thanks, dad. i'll tell you how it goes."_

As I pressed the send button, my eyes drifted back up to the mirror. I saw, very faintly, a glimmer of joy, both in my eyes and in the way I smiled. It was subtle, but it was there.

_I had come such a long way from that hurt, broken, troubled little kid I used to be. I wish that, somehow, I could tell my past self that it would be okay. That it would all work out._

_Here I was, Charlie Cooperton, still alive and kicking._

_And I owe it all to the people I love._

"Hey, you." I heard Skyler's warm, tender voice as she entered our bathroom unexpectedly, wrapping her arms around me and cuddling up to my side. As she threw her tiny, red leather purse on the sink counter, she began to kiss my cheek and nuzzle the tip of her nose into my neck, her paws feeling up my torso, slowly and dexterously. "You almost ready to go?"

"Yeah, almost," I muttered flirtatiously, turning to face her, fondling her ears and rifling my fingers through her hair. I kissed her forehead, my hands gently inching their way down from her cheeks, to her neck, to her shoulders, and to her waist. "This is cute," I admired, pinching the cloth of her adorable, navy blue, tiny-white-star patterned cami dress.¬†

"You like it?" Sky blushed, gazing up innocently into my eyes, our close proximity allotting for the intimate mood generated in the room.¬†

"It fits you," I admitted, using my grip on her waist to turn Skyler's body, making her face the mirror. My arms snaked their way around her stomach, embracing her from behind and resting my head on her shoulder. The two of us stared ahead at the reflection of ourselves fondly.¬†"Both personality and body-wise."

Flustered, Skyler giggled uncontrollably as my wandering paw slid down her leg, grabbing the edge of the dress and pulling it up, exposing her body underneath. All that lay below the first layer of clothing was nothing but a tight sports bra and skimpy pink underwear. I loved the way her form was structured, the shy stance of her legs, the curves of her waist, and the beautiful ombr√© of colors that her fur gave off.¬†

"I love the dress, but, I gotta admit..." My paws continued to graze her body arousingly, feeling up her delicate chest and thin abdomen from below the dress. "...It feels like it's only there for me to take it off."

"Hey, no distractions," Skyler whimpered, a little winded from my evocative touch. "We have a festival to get to."

"Right," I complied, taking my paws off of her and holding them in the air, stepping back in retreat as if I had been caught committing a crime. Sky spun around, leaning against the sink counter with an erotic smirk on her face. "We'll table this for later," I flirted, my eyes scanning her up and down.

Sky just rolled her eyes and shook her head, grabbing her purse from the countertop, unzipping it, and retrieving her phone. "Claire, Becca, and Jonathan are outside," she announced, reading her notifications.¬†

She then grabbed me by the tie and walked out of the bathroom, tugging me along like a dog on a leash. I laughed and fought her grip in the process, but honestly, I was into it. _God, this woman could do anything to me._

_She is the love of my life._

_Tonight, I know that I'll be making the right decision._

  

The moment we had exited out onto the front porch of our house, Skyler had focused her vision on Claire, popping out of Becca's van and squealing gleefully as she ran across our driveway with open arms. Sky ran to her in the same fashion as I locked the front door of the house, following my girlfriend not-too-close behind.¬†

The two had raced into one another's arms, laughing and spinning in circles excitedly. "Oh, my God! I picked out this dress for you!" Claire burst, holding Skyler by the shoulders and gawking at her outfit. "It looks so good on you!"

"Aw, thank you!" Skyler gushed, squeezing Claire's paws. She was so ecstatic about finally wearing what she wanted to wear and being able to show it off, freely and without fear. "Look, the dress is blue, the stars are white, and the purse is red! Red, white, and blue!"

"Sky, you're a genius," Claire fangirled, allowing Skyler to feel more and more comfortable in her own clothes.¬†

"Stop! I love your outfit, too!" Sky praised, openly gaping at Claire's rose-colored bouffant dress.

Leaving the girls to their girly conversation, I approached Jonathan as he exited the van with Becca. The two appeared to be occupied with a bit of friendly small talk. _It's good to see that their friendship has healed after all of the Claire drama._

"Hey, man," I greeted Jonathan with a hug and a pat on the back.¬†

"What's up, bro?" He responded, stepping back to face me formally. Becca stood to the side, admiring the view of the sunset and the beach from the top of the hill on which our house sat.

"Look, I... I just wanted to say," I came a little closer to Jonathan and lowered my voice, "thanks for helping me out. Back in San Francisco. I never really got the chance to tell you, up front." Jonathan pursed his lips and nodded as I continued to express my gratitude. "I know I can be a difficult friend sometimes, and I'm sorry about that. But, thank you, really, for sticking by me, through all of it. Even during my worst moments. It means a lot."

"Don't worry about it, dude," Jonathan assured me, smacking my arm. "I made a promise to myself when I was younger. To care, deeply, first, before making any fatal decisions. And I care about you, Charlie."

I nodded my head, accepting it.

"And how are you holding up?" I turned my attention to Becca, who was also wearing a similar violet dress to Skyler's, but over it, she wore a denim jacket, which fit her style more.

"Me?" Becca looked over at Jonathan and me, caught off guard. In response to my question, she just scoffed and shoved her paws into the pockets of her jacket, staring at her feet as she kicked them against the floor weakly. "Tryin' my best to hold up, mate."

I just smiled and nodded again, accepting her response. I reached forward and gave her a little side hug, which she received graciously. "I'm glad you're here. With us." We separated, maintaining affectionate eye contact. "And, well, for tonight."

"You think you're ready?" Becca whispered, her eyes keenly watching a distracted Skyler, still engaged in conversation with Claire. I looked back at her, too, admiring how stunningly gorgeous she was with that huge, unburdened smile on her face.¬†

_I got emotional just looking at her smile. At long last, she's fully and completely happy. I've never before been so in love with someone to the point where I feel like crying whenever I look at their face._

"Yeah," I said, a little choked up. "I'm ready."

"I'm happy for you, man," Jonathan nudged me in the arm harshly, making me laugh with an 'ow' from the sudden sharp pain. "I really hope it goes well."

"It will," Becca stated without a doubt in her mind. "I know it will."

"Alright, guys!" Claire exclaimed, entering herself and Skyler back into the friend group with uncontrollable excitement. "Who's ready for some fireworks tonight?!"

We all stuck our fists in the air and whirled them around as we whooped and cheered, immediately heading for Red Velvet and climbing inside. Fortunately, we all had helped to clean it out and organize the contents on the inside for Becca a while ago, our own gesture of goodwill to keep her on her feet.¬†

With Becca at the wheel, Claire and Jonathan sitting in front, and Skyler and I in the back, we all strapped in for a quick ride to the L.A. County Fair, where there would be a 4th of July celebration with fireworks and everything Independence-Day-themed. As Becca started the engine, Claire looked over her shoulder, checking on us in the back. Skyler was sitting on my lap, giggling and grasping me desperately by the shoulders as I tickled the life out of her.¬†

"Everyone buckled up?" She asked, glancing over at Becca and Jonathan on either side of her, too. Once Skyler had sat down in the seat beside me, we all gave her a thumbs-up, to which she replied with, "Alright! Let's go!"¬†

She then patted Becca on the back, signaling her to get a move on. Before she spun back around in her seat, Claire gave me a subtle wink, her own little 'good luck' message to me.

With glee, I wrapped my arms around Skyler, attacking her head with kisses as the van pulled out of our driveway and headed for the fair. We spent the drive singing along to music on the radio, organizing our money and belongings, mapping out the evening ahead of us, and gushing about our upcoming summer plans.

Once we got there, the gigantic parking lot was already filled to the brim with cars and a ginormous congregation of people, pushing through the crowd in order to buy their tickets to the fair. Since today was the 4th of July festival, millions of people all over Los Angeles had come to see the great fireworks display that would be happening later tonight. The sun was already beginning to set, so now was the time when it made the most sense to show up. You'd have a few good hours to go on rides and play carnival games, and when it hit nine o'clock, you'd be seated in the field, ready for the show.

Becca was cursing angrily and honking her van's horn over and over, trying to get the overflowing stampede of people to move so she could find parking. She told us to just go in and buy our tickets while she parked, and even though we tried to resist the kind suggestion, she begged and eventually convinced us to. Reluctantly, we hopped out of the van and set foot on the pavement, heading for the entrance to the fair.

As we made our way through the bustling parking lot, we finally reached the tall, circus-themed arch that served as the golden gate entryway. Ahead, there were several ticket stands with long, annoying lines that were noisy and exhausting. I felt bad for the ticket sellers, having to deal with so many people. But beyond the hellish admission booths, we could see, standing tall and mighty in the distance, what the wait was _really_ worth: the gigantic, glistening structures of thrilling rollercoasters, frighteningly high swing carousels, widely-stretched overhead gondola lifts, and last but _definitely_ not least, the famous, dazzling, grand, 150-foot tall Ferris Wheel; bursting with bright, vibrant colors, standing and spinning prominently before the golden sunset backdrop, infested with a milky blue sky of cotton pink clouds.¬†

I felt the nerves in my body twinge at the sight of it, knowing its importance in tonight's event. My hand squeezed Skyler's paw tightly as we raced to get in line.

Suddenly, I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket once again as we got closer to the ticket stands. Pulling it out to check what the notification was, I saw that I got a message from an old friend, reading:¬†_"I'm almost there! Can't wait to finally see you again!"_

I felt another burst of nervous excitement inside me when I saw that text. Stopping in my tracks, I opened the thread and responded:¬†_"See you there! I can't wait for you to meet everyone!"_

"Charlie!" Skyler called out, standing ahead of me, looking back and waiting patiently. "You coming?"

"I'm gonna wait for Becca, but you go ahead! I'll meet up with you guys later! Just text me where you end up," I lied, using Becca as an excuse.

"Are you sure?" Skyler tilted her head, a little disappointed to be leaving my side. I ran up to her and grasped her by the paws, giving her an assuring look.¬†

"Go have fun!" I told her, brushing my paw against her cheek. "I love you."

"I love you, too," Skyler swooned, giving me a quick peck on the lips before running off to get in line with Claire and Jonathan. "I'll see you inside!"

I waved with a smile before spinning around and walking back to the front. Standing by the archway, I waited both patiently and impatiently for my friend to arrive. Tonight would be one of the most important nights of my life. I really wanted one of my oldest friends to be here when it happened, so I invited her a few days ago. We _did_ make a promise about it to one another when we were kids.

After waiting a few minutes, Becca showed up after finally finding parking. We waved at one another as she passed by, entering the fair, though she was likely confused about why I was waiting by the front.¬†

When about ten minutes had passed, I was growing more and more distressed. I may have just been overreacting, but I _really_ wanted tonight to go well. I really wanted her here for it.

As I stared at my phone, considering sending her another text, that was when a distant voice had called out: _"Charlie!"_

No words could describe the bittersweet nostalgia I received once I heard the sound of her voice. It sent chills down my spine and unlocked a _boatload_ of childhood memories. As I slowly inched my eyes up from my phone with anticipation, I saw her, standing only a few meters away from me.

The bright, bubbly poodle with frizzy, white fur, dressed in a sage green noodle-strap top and black leggings. Even though I could only catch short glimpses of her, at a distance, in-between the spaces of passing strangers... I knew _automatically_ that it was her.¬†

_She hadn't changed a bit. She couldn't have._

  

"CASSIE!" I blissfully screamed aloud, running towards her with arms wide open.¬†

Cassie, one of my oldest childhood friends and former high school sweetheart, did the same, leaping into my arms. We captured one another, laughing joyfully and swirling around in circles, _finally_ reunited after so many years apart.¬†

"Oh, my God!" I whimpered, squeezing her tightly and pressing my face into her shoulder, not holding back. "It's been so long, Cass..."

"I missed you so much," she moaned, on the brink of tears. We broke the hug apart, taking the opportunity to soak in the sight of one another's faces; ones that haven't met in far too long. "How long has it been? Five years?"

"It's felt like decades," I smiled widely and graciously, so thrilled to finally be with her again. Cassie wiped her eyes, unable to rid herself of that contagious smile. Like the fireworks that would be soaring into the sky tonight, we were both _bursting_ with joy. "I'm so happy you came, I'm sorry it was so last minute."

"Oh, shut up! Thank you¬†for inviting me!" She beamed with yearning emotion, reaching in for another hug. _I missed the way she felt, the touch of her fur, and the delightful mood she emanated with her presence._

"You know I had to," I muttered as we swayed back and forth during the embrace. "We promised each other that we'd be here for one another on the day that _this_ happened."

"I'm so happy for you, Charlie," she expressed, pulling back to give me a warm, prideful gaze. "After everything you've said about her, I really think she's the one.¬†_Really_. I _pray_ that tonight goes well."

"Usually, I try not to expect success," I admitted, "But, I feel _really_ confident, Cass."

"When do I get to meet her?!" Cassie practically begged, jumping up and down excitedly. "And your new friends, too? Can I meet them?!"

"Let's get in line," I chuckled, patting her shoulder and directing my paw towards the entrance. The two of us headed for the ticket stands, ready to embark on an evening of energetic amusement.

After we had waited in line for a few minutes, paid upfront, and claimed our day-pass wristbands, we journeyed into the fairgrounds to meet with the others. Every inch of my surroundings were whizzing to life with glowing signs, illuminated by flashing colored bulbs, heavy-metal structures supporting towering, scary rides, and passing blurs of various people, heading every which way. My ears were overwhelmed by the sounds of screaming children, the chiming of carnival game bells, the startling pops of exploding balloons, and the gusts of wind made by the rushing rollercoaster carts, going up and down the narrow tracks. I could smell the buttery, salty scent of popcorn and the sugary sweet fragrance of cotton candy. The collective expression of happiness and thrill¬†was present on all the faces of everyone inhabiting the overly packed area. Cassie latched onto my shoulder as we tried to budge our way through the sea of animals, laughing in the midst of it. In _this_ type of crowd, take your eyes off of someone for one second and you could easily lose them.

As we walked past the many food stands‚Äîselling long bags of popcorn, cotton candy, and ice-cold lemonade‚Äî_and_ the vibrantly loud carnival games‚Äîincluding water-gun target aiming, bottle ring tossing, and balloon dart-throwing‚ÄîI _finally_ caught a glimpse of my pink and blue colored feline, waiting patiently for my presence with the others. Becca had finally accompanied them.¬†

"There they are," I pointed at the troop for Cass to identify. "You ready to meet them?"

"I've been waiting _years_¬†for this! Yes, of course!" Cassie squealed with anticipated joy. I grabbed onto her hand and we both immediately raced towards the crew, who hadn't expected to see me with her.

"Guys!" I called out, gaining their attention as Cassie and I approached them, dead in the middle of the raging cluster of both people and fair attractions. Skyler, Claire, and Becca gave us confused looks. "I want you to meet an old friend of mine! This is Ca‚Äî"

"‚ÄîCASSIE FUCKING DUVALL?!" Jonathan yelled aloud, his face entirely lit up with surprise. It was as if he had seen a ghost. He was so shocked to see her familiar face that he almost stumbled over and fell backward.

"Jonathan!" Cassie gushed, unbelievably happy.

Jonathan, overcome with nostalgic bliss, lunged for her with open arms and the two embraced firmly. I looked on with sentimental pleasure, seeing the old high school chums reunite just as we had done earlier. "Holy shit," he gasped, out of breath, "I can't believe it's really you..."

Skyler gave me a surprised glance with widened eyes as I smiled guiltily. I hadn't told any of them that she was coming, so of course, I had to own up to it.¬†

"So, storytime, uh, Cassie and I have been in touch for a while and we've wanted to meet up for a very long time, but our schedules never seemed to line up... That is, until today," I explained, giving the others their much-needed context. "So, I decided to bring her here as a surprise! She's been wanting to meet you guys since, like, _forever_, so, Cassie, I'd like you to meet my friends!" I patted the fluffy poodle on the back as she parted from Jonathan's arms. "Firstly, this is Skyler, my amazing, beautiful, _wonderful_ girlfriend‚Äî"

"‚ÄîAH!¬†Oh, my God, I've wanted to meet you for _so_ long!" Cassie squeaked with eagerness as if she were encountering a celebrity, directly going in for a hug.¬†

"Oh‚Äî!" Skyler gasped,¬†still a little dumbfounded, as Cassie swept her up into an embrace. They parted from the quick hug and held one another by the arms, stunned and hyped up on exhilaration. "You're _the_ Cassie? The one I've heard so much about?!"

"Shut up!¬†_I've_ heard so much about _you!"_ Cassie reflected, making Skyler's face light up with charm. _They both immediately loved one another, I could tell._

"Well, Charlie's very expressive about the people he loves," Jonathan spoke up, ruffling his fist into the fur on my head. Flustered, I swatted him away, patting down my messy hair.

"I would understand!" Cassie expressed, taking in the sight of Skyler in front of her. "You're so _fucking_ pretty, Jesus Christ!"

"No, stop, you're gorgeous!" Skyler whined with enthusiasm, gazing at her face and her dress and everything she found beautiful about her. "No wonder Charlie fell in love with you in high school," she chuckled sarcastically.

"Oh, my..." I muttered to myself, rubbing my forehead.

"Sky, pl‚ÄîCan I call you that? 'Sky'?" Skyler nodded with a giggle in response to Cassie's request. "Sky, please, _you're_ the gorgeous one, no wonder he fell in love with _you!"_

"Wow, okay, let's‚Äî" I attempted to keep the introductions going. They talked about me as if I wasn't there.

"‚ÄîGod, this is... I've _always_ wanted to meet you, Charlie would talk _so much_ about you when we first met," Skyler burst, staring at Cassie with disbelief as if she still wasn't convinced that she was real. Their chatter between one another was unstoppable. "Cassie, I...¬†Thank you, so much, for everything you've done for him‚Äî"

"‚ÄîSkyler, are you kidding?! Thank _you!"_ Cassie prodded her finger into Skyler's chest firmly. "From what I've heard, you've been the light of his life. All he ever does is talk about how happy you've made him, and how in love he is with you, and... Thank _you_ for giving that to him."

"...Is that true?" Skyler chortled,¬†overwhelmed by many emotions, her eyes moving over to me.

"...Yeah," I admitted, nodding my head and scratching the back of my neck.¬†

"...I haven't known you for any longer than a minute, but I already love you," Skyler set her eyes back on Cassie, professing her admiration for the canine.¬†

"Stop! I love you, too‚Äî!" Cassie beamed right before I pulled her away, directing her attention towards the other two girls, standing awkwardly in the background.

"‚ÄîAnyway, before you guys start making out, this is Claire," I resumed, turning Cassie to face the female fox right next to Skyler.¬†

Claire smiled widely and held her paw out for Cassie. "Hi! I don't know¬†as much about you as the others do, but you seem great!"

"Girl, fuck that," Cassie scoffed, slapping Claire's paw away and pulling her into a hug as well. "It's nice to meet you, too!"

Claire tittered as they rocked from side to side during the embrace. "You're definitely a hugger."

"She's very huggy," Jonathan remarked.

As the two huggers parted, I introduced Cassie to the final one of the bunch. "And lastly, this is Becca."

Becca stepped up to Cassie awkwardly, her arms outstretched, expecting another hug.¬†

Cassie paused for a second as if she were wonderstruck by the petite wolf standing before her, a little hesitant to move at first.¬†

"H-Hi," Cass greeted timidly, submerging herself into the hug. The rest of us watched and glanced at one another as the two embraced in a slightly strange way, both extremely awkward and shy.

The two separated from the hug, staring at one another's faces bashfully.

"I... I like your makeup," Becca complimented, blushing a little as she brushed a few strands of her hair behind her ear. "...You're really pretty."

"I... like your accent," Cassie flattered, mirroring the same energy as Becca. "You're really pretty, too."

"Oh, yeah? Everyone says that," Becca rolled her eyes with a chuckle, making Cassie giggle as well. "I guess that's what I get for moving to the states."¬†

The two then realized their hands were still touching from the aftermath of the embrace, immediately pulling back with an uneasy flinch.

Skyler and I looked at one another, suddenly aware of what was occurring. She just raised her eyebrows and smirked amorously.

"...So, yeah, that's everyone," I spoke up, smacking my paws together. Cassie turned around, her face still a little flushed after the encounter with Becca, who just stood there, staring at her feet, unable to wipe the lovesick smile off of her face. "Now that we're all acquainted with one another... let's have some fun!"

"Yes! Let's go!" Claire cheered, incapable of waiting any longer. She grasped Jonathan's shoulder and raised her fist into the sky.

"Where are we starting first?" Cassie bounced with excitement, overjoyed to be experiencing this moment with us, now a part of the friend group.

"We have over five hundred acres of land to explore," Becca chimed in, approaching Cassie's side. "We could go anywhere."

"Does anyone have a map? They were handing them out at the ticket stands," Jonathan informed.

"I got one," I announced, pulling it out of my back pocket and unfolding the tiny pamphlet. We all huddled together and looked on in amazement at how many rides and attractions there were to visit. "We have around an hour and a half before they close the fair and open up the field for the fireworks show. I say we start from where we are now and make our way around the entire amusement park, doing everything in our path. Sound good?"

The others nodded. Skyler and Cassie both said "Yeah!" in unison.¬†

"Alright! _Let's do this!"_ I exulted, shaking my fists with elation, almost crumbling the map in my paw.¬†

"Let's fucking _GO!"_ Claire roared as if she were the announcer at a hardcore wrestling match. We all cheered and hollered out of pure jubilation, following Claire as she led the way, tugging her husband along by his hand.

I wrapped my arm around Skyler as we followed them alongside Cassie and Becca, starting our thrilling journey into the heart of the LA County Fair.

\~~~

## Claire

As expected, we began with a few rides. We all decided to collectively board the massive swing carousel first; where the giant umbrella-looking machine, with seats dangling from long and seemingly unstable chains, would spin around in circles, giving its riders a massive overview of the entire fair, one hundred feet in the sky. Jonathan and I shared a double seat swing together, as did Sky and Charlie. Becca and Cassie sat in their own individual singular swings, but luckily, we were all close to one another. It really wouldn't matter anyway, though, 'cause when you're up there in the sky, swinging at a high speed through the air, your seat tends to drift away from all the others.

As we rose from the ground, our feet lifting off of the floor and gaining distance from it with every passing second, the carousel began to spin, and soon enough, we were flying. The gravity began to grow in intensity as I grabbed onto Jonathan's side, laughing with thrill. The world seemed to spiral below us, like a village of ants from a giant's perspective. The sunset flew by with every rotation, coating us in it's warm golden glow after each meeting. I watched as Charlie flailed his limbs around excitedly in the swing in front of us, rocking the seat and scaring Skyler enough to the point where she had to hide her face in her boyfriend's lap. Turning around, I saw Cassie holding her arms out, pretending to be an airplane, encouraging Becca to join in as well. They both howled into the wind like the canines they were, laughing and enjoying the ride together. I felt my smile grow wider, seeing Becca happy.

Charlie was daredevil enough to pull out his phone and take a selfie of us in the middle of the ride while spinning through the air at thirty miles per hour. Jonathan and I posed for the picture as Skyler kept yelling at him to put it away, frightened of him dropping and breaking it. Once the ride was over, we reached the ground and regrouped outside of the ride, looking at the selfie. Somehow, he was able to capture all of us, even when we were at different distances. _They don't call him a photographer for nothing_.¬†

Becca was a little queasy from all the spinning, but thankfully, Cassie was right there, helping her stand on her own two feet.

We hit a very narrow, up-and-down kind of rollercoaster next, and since every cart on the ride was a two-seater, the same seating arrangement as before was put in place. Only this time, Becca and Cassie had to actually share the cart. Luckily enough, the two were getting along just fine, so we didn't have to worry.¬†

As we slowly ascended the steep incline just before the first drop, I grabbed onto Jonathan's hand tightly, raising it in the air along with our other hands. Charlie and Cassie had joined in, but Skyler and Becca were, of course, too afraid to let go of the handlebars. Once we had plummeted down the first drop, leading into a spiraling jungle of rapid twists and turns, we were all screaming; some of us with excitement and some out of terror. _I'm sure you could guess who were the scaredy-cats._¬†

Charlie had to carry Skyler out of the ride afterwards in bridal-style fashion. Her legs were trembling so much out of fear that she could barely walk.¬†

Next up was this pretty unique-looking rollercoaster: one that had circular train carts that seated four people, and whenever it changed drastically, whether in height or in direction, it would spin around on its axis. Since we didn't want to isolate Cassie and Becca from the group again, we decided that all of the girls would go on the ride together while the men found another rollercoaster to board. Charlie and Jonathan could've gone together, but since the ride was a four-person requirement, they'd have to be seated with two other strangers, so of course, they bailed.¬†

The four of us stood in line, leaning against the fence that organized the group of people, waiting to board the rollercoaster, into a zigzagging pathway. We were all fanning ourselves because of both the immense heat and the tiresome walking from one attraction to another.

"Cassie," Skyler spoke up, breaking the silence and starting a bit of small talk to make the wait less boring. "You gotta tell us what Charlie and Jonathan were like in high school."

"Ooh, yes!" I cackled, ready to hear all the dirty secrets.¬†

"Oh, my God," Cassie snorted, face-palming with a hint of embarrassment. "Uh... I dunno, they were kind of how you'd imagine normal high school boys to be like. Annoying and cocky on the surface, but with a bit of a sweet side once you got to know them."

"Your idea of 'normal high school boys' is much different than mine," I snorted, thinking back to all the major dickheads I knew in senior year.

"What was it like dating Charlie?" Skyler questioned very curiously. "...I wanna know if it was any different."

Cassie paused, staring blankly into space as she hesitated. She must've been organizing her thoughts or something. It's been years since they dated, so of course, it would take a few seconds to remember.

"Well, I guess... He was a really sweet guy. Always caring about me and shit... but he would _always_ put my needs before his own and... that got a little concerning," Cassie explained, crossing her arms and looking at the floor.¬†  

"Sounds like Charlie," Skyler exhaled through her nose sharply as a replacement for a laugh.

"I swear, that man has White Knight Syndrome," Becca remarked, making us all chuckle.

"Other than that, he was so, _so_ kind. And he helped me through a lot, like my issues with depression, my parents, my friends, school, my sexuality, and some other TMI shit," Cassie went on, brushing it off with a shake of her head. I saw Becca's ears perk up at the word 'sexuality'.¬†

"You helped him a lot, too," Skyler credited her, patting her on the shoulder. Cassie just smiled subtly, her eyes landing on Sky. "He never really understood how to love someone properly until you came around. I don't know if he ever showed it, but you really did help, Cass. He's doing a lot better now."

"Yeah... He tried to hide it sometimes, but I could tell he was a _really_ broken person," Cassie confessed, giving Skyler a comforting look. "He never really gave me the chance to help him with his _own_ issues, though. But, you did. So, I guess he never really understood how to love someone _fully_ until you, Skyler."

Skyler's emotional grin widened as the two of them gave each other reassuring looks.¬†

"Jonathan was pretty hurt, too, if you can believe it," Cassie directed her attention to me.

"Oh, trust me, I can," I answered, knowing everything that he'd endured. Jonathan would tell me a lot about his life in high school. "He went through a lot as a kid and did dumb shit, I know all about it."

"You've definitely helped, too, Claire," she told me, comfortingly.

"...Thank you, Cass," I sucked on my teeth, giving into another hug. Cassie accepted it, happily. As we pulled apart, I opened my eyes to see Becca, still standing awkwardly with no way to insert herself into the conversation.

"Now, tell me," Cassie turned to Skyler again, "What is Charlie like now?"

"Oh, God, are you sure you wanna open¬†_that_ box?" Skyler simpered, the two of them diving into their own saucy conversation.

As they continued to speak to one another, I took a step closer to Becca, approaching her nonchalantly.¬†

"...You okay?" I whispered into her ear so the others wouldn't notice.

She turned her head naively to me, our eyes meeting. She didn't seem to understand why I was asking.

"...Yeah, why?" Becca whispered back with a scoff.

"I dunno... After everything, I still want to make sure you're okay."

The tips of Becca's mouth had curled upwards, a thin sliver of her teeth showing. She must've appreciated the effort, at least. "I'm fine, Claire. Not great, obviously, but I'm doing better."

I bit my bottom lip and tapped my foot against the concrete floor. "You know you can always come to me, right?"

"I always do."

"Yeah, but... especially in times like these."

"Yeah, I know..." Becca's voice trailed off as something cluttered her mind. She stared ahead at Skyler and Cassie, who were still indulged in their own private chatter. "But... I want to try to... _learn_ how to... pick myself back up. On my own, without having to come to anyone."

"Just... don't isolate yourself from us again, alright?"

Becca, with her arms crossed, smiled to herself and nodded. "I'm trying. I'm trying to learn how to avoid isolating... from you guys... and from myself." Becca's eyes made their way back to me. "I want to be a better person, Claire."

"You _are_ a good person."

"I want to be _better_."

Without showing my teeth, my lips had formed into a smile as well, giving Becca an assuring and warm gaze. My brows had tilted with emotion. "I know you'll do just fine," I told her, grabbing her hand and squeezing it.

Becca gave me the same faint smile back. She nodded and turned her focus back to the others.

"Hey, Sky," Becca called out, gaining the other's attention. "...Are you gonna tell us about you and Charlie or what?"

"What about us?" Skyler tilted her head, puzzled, just like me and Cassie.

"You know..." Becca chuckled devilishly, leaning in and lowering her voice for the next word. _"...Sex?"_

I suddenly gasped, clasping my paws over my mouth, remembering that non-virgin Skyler was a thing now. Skyler's face had gone red in a matter of milliseconds as Becca smirked promiscuously, bouncing her eyebrows up and down. Cassie just grabbed Skyler by the arm and squealed: "Yes, tell us! Tell us!"

"Oh, my God, I completely forgot about this!" I rushed, my words trampling over one another. "You said you'd tell us before! You gotta spill the tea _now_, girl!"

"Yes, tell us everything!" Cassie shook Skyler's arm eagerly as Becca and I closed in.

"Uh, I think the line is moving‚Äî" Skyler tried to change the subject, but of course, we all grabbed her and began to beg her for the details.¬†

"Please, please!" I needily implored, grabbing Skyler's hand and dropping down to my knees. Becca held her paws together as Cassie grabbed Sky by the shoulders, still shaking her.

"Alright, alright!" Skyler whined, rubbing her temples with embarrassment. She was blushing like crazy. "...God, how do I start? I don't know..! Just, like, ask me questions and I'll answer them! I don't know‚Äî!"

"‚ÄîWHAT POSITION?!" Becca screamed aloud, making everyone in the line turn their heads at us, humiliating Sky even more.

"Um..." Skyler giggled nervously, a bead of sweat dripping down her forehead. "...There's a few..."

"YOU'VE DONE IT MULTIPLE TIMES?!" I hollered out of pure astonishment.

"How many times?!" Cassie pressed, _still_ shaking Skyler like crazy.

"Uh... A few?" Skyler trembled, touching her fingers together shyly.¬†

"How many times is _a few?!"_ I needled, grasping the sides of my head out of anticipation and almost ripping the fur out of my skull.

Sky cleared her throat. "...S-Six?"

"SIX?!" Cassie yelped, almost fainting.

"BITCH!" Becca squeaked, grabbing Skyler and tossing her into a large, restrictive bear hug. "MY LITTLE SLUT, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!"

"Please keep it down..." Skyler whimpered into Becca's shoulder, hiding away from watching eyes that surrounded us.

"YOU GET THAT FUCKIN' DICK, SIS!" I shrieked carelessly, joining the hug. Becca and I squeezed the small feline between us, almost choking her.

"I hope y'all had six condoms," Cassie expressed with a funny voice, wrapping her arms around all of us, together.

\~~~

## Jonathan

Charlie and I stood outside of the rollercoaster, watching as Claire, Skyler, Becca, and Cassie slowly made their way up the precipitous incline that lead to the first drop. We could hear their high-pitched screams, out of horrified anticipation, as they sluggishly approached the peak.

"CLAIRE! HOLD ME! _HOLD ME!"_ Skyler's screeching voice could be perceived clearly from very far away, making Charlie laugh hysterically while he recorded a video on his phone.

"I'M HOLDING YOU! I'M FUCKING HOLDING YOU!" Claire screamed desperately in response as they just mounted the tip before the drop.

"FUCK! FUUUUCK!" Becca was losing her mind, clinging to both Claire and Cassie. "I LOVE YOU GUYS!"

The moment they had dropped down the intense decline, they were all screaming their heads off as if they were being murdered. The cart spun around in circles, sending them knocking into one another as it swung from side to side. Charlie and I continued to laugh as we saw our female counterparts thrash around the course of the wild, vigorous ride. The sound of their shrieking was so loud that it could shatter glass.

Once it was over, they stumbled their way out of the exit lane, hunched over and¬†collapsing into one another like brain-dead zombies. I scooped Claire up into my arms as Charlie did the same with Sky, hugging her from behind. Becca, on the other hand, had been pushed to the limit, sending her running for the nearest trash can. Cassie had to pull her hair back as she puked.

That was when we decided to ditch the rides for a bit and play some carnival games instead.

Charlie and the other girls went to race each other in the water gun game, where they had to shoot water at a target, which was in the center of a clown's mouth, in order to fill up a balloon with air to the point where it bursts. With Claire's hand in mine, we left them to their own devices and made our way to the ring toss stand, which had a bunch of empty Coke bottles laid out in rows. Land a plastic ring on the necks of three bottles and you win a prize.¬†

"I'm gonna win you a flamingo," I told Claire as I handed the game operator a five-dollar bill.¬†

"You better," Claire smiled, latching onto my left arm, observing as I obtained the three rings needed to play the game. Three chances.

As I scanned the array of bottles, analyzing and aiming for my first toss, I figured, since Claire and I were alone, _now_ was the right time to talk to her about what I'd been feeling recently.¬†

"You know," I spoke, licking my lips as I leaned forward with the first ring, armed and ready to fire, in my right hand. "If I do win this toy..."

I tossed the ring. Like a slam dunk in a game of basketball, it landed cleanly on the neck of the bottle I had aimed for. The game operator clapped and held up two fingers; _two more chances_ _to win._

I grabbed the second ring and held it up, ready for the next toss. But, before I made the shot, I looked down at Claire, still wrapped around my left arm, expecting me to throw the ring.¬†

"...We can maybe give it to our daughter."

As she looked up at me instantly, a growing sense of bewilderment in her eyes, I focused back on the playing board and took the shot. It hit the edge of one of the bottles and flipped, landing on the neck of the bottle right next to it, adorning it like a necklace. I winced at how close it was.

"...What do you mean?" Claire mumbled in disbelief. Her grip on my arm grew a little tighter as I picked up the last ring. The operator held up one more finger.

As I held the final ring in the air, I looked back down at Claire one more time.

"I mean... I'm all in, baby," I spoke below my breath, lavishly and truthfully. "I've given it thought, and I think I'm ready to start this new chapter with you. With everything happening, with Charlie and Sky tonight, and the whole Becca thing... It made me realize how much I want to prove to you... that I love you, unconditionally. If a child is enough proof, then let's do it. I want to do this with you."

I looked back over at the array of bottles, the ring held firmly between my fingers.

"Let's start a family, Claire," I stated, making the final toss.

The ring soared through the air, spinning as it flew towards the bottle that I had aimed for. With my paw clenched into a fist, I could only pray to God that it would land.

  

The ring had ricocheted off the side of the bottle and fell between the individual spaces of the Coke glass assortment.¬†

With a disappointed groan, I snapped my fingers, taking the loss. But, before I could mourn the loss of a stuffed flamingo, Claire had grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me to face her. In her eyes, I could see hope in its purest and most gorgeous form.¬†

"I'll buy one on Amazon," she assured me, leaning up and landing her muzzle on mine. Though my mouth was occupied, I laughed in between smooches, soaking in the soft touch of her lips. The two of us kissed passionately, our arms wrapped around one another and our bodies held close and intimately. "Besides, I'm not giving our daughter a flamingo from a rigged carnival game."

As she said that, we heard the ringing of a victory bell somewhere in the distance. We turned our heads in the direction of the sound and saw Becca jumping up and down in celebration, just having won the water gun race. Charlie, Skyler, and Cassie had joined her in the celebrating, cheering and hugging her exuberantly.¬†

Claire giggled at the sight, resting her head against my chest. A single tear fell from her eye, hitting my shirt. It was good to see Becca in such high spirits.

"Do you think it'll be a girl?" Claire asked me, her voice quiet and tender.

"Whatever it is," I told her, rubbing my paw against her head. "It'll be ours."

## Becca

The sun was now almost completely gone from the sky, only a bright orange sliver left behind, peeking out from between the high metal beams of various rollercoaster rides. Ahead of us, Skyler and Charlie held hands, admiring their surroundings as they passed through the crowd. Beside them, Jonathan carried Claire in his arms, spinning her around and making her wheeze out of amusement.¬†

I continued to stroll forward silently, in close proximity to Cassie, brushing the soft fur of the stuffed llama plush I won as a prize from the water game. I looked around, seeing all the happy families and lovely couples, all enjoying themselves, running around with colorful balloons and giant cones of candy floss in their hands.

"What are you going to name it?" Cassie's voice had caught my attention.

"Oh‚Äîuh," I stammered, my eyes darting back and forth from her to the toy. "I don't know. I hadn't thought about naming it, honestly."

"Are you just gonna call it 'llama'?" Cassie snickered, making me laugh in return.

"You know what, maybe I will call it 'llama'," I said, mocking the way she said 'llama' with an overexaggerated American accent. Cassie just tittered, looking ahead at the rest of our mates with bright, gleaming eyes.

_Skyler was right, no wonder Charlie fell in love with her._  

"Was Charlie the only guy you've ever dated?" I blurted out randomly, catching Cassie off guard. "Sorry, that was... a dumb question. Probably not."

"Actually, he's the only guy that _I_ consider to have ever _really_ dated," Cassie corrected. "I've been with other guys, yeah, but not as _real_ relationships."

"Same," I said, immediately relating to her situation. "I mean, with the relationships part, not with the guys. I've... only ever been with women."

"Oh? That's cool," Cassie nodded her head, accepting it welcomingly. _I didn't expect her to say anything about my sexuality, a simple nod was enough for me._ But then, she disclosed: "I mean, when I said Charlie was the only _guy_ I've dated, I didn't mean that he was the only _person_. I've been with girls, too."

"...Really?" I turned to look at her, my hopes starting to rise.

"Yeah," Cassie chuckled, seemingly thinking back to a past, light-hearted memory of hers. "When Charlie came out to me as bisexual, I decided to come out, too. As bisexual. It was really funny, we were both laughing _so hard_ when it happened."

"That sounds nice," I mumbled, staring at the floor, feeling my cheeks burn.

"I haven't had much luck with love lately, if I'm being totally honest," Cassie confessed, scratching her head.

"Yeah, me too."

After a moment of serene silence, Cassie impulsively grabbed the stuffed animal plush out of my hands and shoved it in my face. "What are you talking about? You have Llama!"

She then proceeded to press Llama to my face repeatedly, making over-the-top kissing sounds. I laughed and tried to fight back, but the smothering smooches were far too strong.¬†

"He's _so_ in love with you," Cassie mocked my British accent as I pushed Llama away. "He's a _romantic_ Spanish lover, you _know_ he's into you."

"It's a 'he'?"

"Should it not be?"

"It should be non-binary," I giggled, grabbing the plush and petting its head. "Llama, the gender-non-conforming llama." Cassie continued to smile extravagantly, joining me in giving Llama head-pats.

"Hey, you wanna ride that spaceship thing?" Cassie pointed her finger at the Gravitron: this spinning contraption that tilted at an angle as it maneuvered, manipulating gravity and allowing you to stand right up against the wall as it spun.¬†

"Another bloody spinny ride? I'm not sure, Cassie," I groaned, clutching Llama tighter.¬†"Llama's a newborn baby! I can't put their life in danger like that!"

"If you put Llama in your shirt, they can ride with us. C'mon, let's go before everything closes and the fireworks start!"¬†

Cassie grabbed me by the hand and tugged me along as she ran towards the Gravitron, ditching the others. I continued to wheeze with laughter once again as I followed her, pleased to be accompanied by this weird, wacky woman.

_I didn't want to admit it, but for the first time in a really, really long while, I was feeling butterflies in my stomach._

_Cassie was different, unlike any other girl I'd met before._

_And somehow, after only an hour of knowing this stranger, I've felt feelings for her that I haven't received in forever. It wasn't sexual or anything related to greed or lust, no... It was different._

_It was a crush. And that's it._

_...I'm not sure if I'm ready to pursue another possibly hopeless romance, though. I don't think my heart can take that again._

_But, maybe it would be different this time?_

  

_One thing's for sure, though. Charlie has great taste in women._

## Skyler

Soon enough, nine o'clock was just around the corner and the sun had completely left the sky. As the fairgrounds began to clear out and the large, brightly colored attractions were shut down for the night, we all headed for the field just beyond the amusement park. And by 'we all', I meant _everyone_ that had come to the LA County Fair. The entire horde of fair attendees began to swarm their way to the field, looking like something straight out of a zombie apocalypse movie. There were even people who hadn't gone to the fair attending _just_ for the fireworks event.

The crowd, including us, had reached this large, grassy plain that used to be an old football field. I could hear the main overlapping voices and noises coming from the vast congregation of people showing up for the fireworks display as they set up their spots on the field, laying down blankets and unfolding portable chairs. More fair workers were coming around, tailoring small carts that carried neon glow sticks, light-up play wands, and LED streamers for the kids, as well as some snacks and drinks in order to claim a few extra bucks. I could see some groups of friends being purposefully hectic, going wild and jumping up and down to music blasting from their speakers. I could see some families gathering closely together with their glow-in-the-dark purchases, and I could even see a few couples snuggling up to one another. I hugged Charlie's arm as we made our way onto the field with Jonathan and Claire.

Becca and Cassie showed up, carrying a few folded-up beach chairs in their arms, having made a quick run back to the van to acquire the items. Jonathan and Claire set up their chairs as Becca and Cassie shared the blanket on the floor, all of us sitting right smack in the middle of the football field where we'd be getting the best view.

Excited for the show to begin, I looked around for a chair, only to find that they had only brought two.

"Hey, where are the other chairs that I brought‚Äî?" I tried to ask before Charlie grabbed me by the paw, distracting me.¬†

I turned to face him, only to see that he was leading me away from the others, walking backward with an eager smile on his face.

"What are you doing?" I chuckled, confused by his actions.

"I want to take you somewhere real quick," Charlie told me, grasping _both_ of my hands now.

"But, the show's about to start‚Äî" I attempted, only to hear Claire call out my name.

When I turned back around, I saw all of our friends staring back at Charlie and me. Jonathan, Claire, Becca, and Cassie were looking on with warm, supportive expressions on their faces as if they knew what had lied ahead.

"Go," Claire said with a nod as Charlie gently tugged on my paws again.

I felt my brows furrow with confusion, wanting to ask them what was going on, but it was too late. I spun back around and continued to follow Charlie, with my hand held firmly in his, through the bustling crowd on the field. We made our way off of the grassy plain and back into the fairgrounds, much to my uncertainty.

As I looked around at all of the abandoned and eerily shut-down attractions, lifeless and left alone, surrounded by the shadowed rollercoasters and carnival game stations, I was starting to feel a little nervous.¬†

"Charlie, what are we doing?" I whispered to him as we retraced our steps, coming back the way we came through the entire amusement park.¬†

"Don't worry," Charlie answered blatantly. "You're safe."

He pulled me forward and wrapped his arm around my shoulder, making sure that I _felt_ safe, owning up to his statement. Though we were now completely alone and incredibly far from the field, I knew that, in Charlie's arms, I'd _always_ be safe.

As we continued down the vacant path, inhabited only by litter and ghostly footprints, I noticed what lay ahead. The destination that Charlie _must've_ been bringing me to.

In the distance, the silhouette of the massive Ferris Wheel stood firmly against the starry sky, looming over us like a shadow in the dark.

"Charlie, what's going on..?" I looked up at him concerningly as we continued to head towards the massive structure.

"...You'll see," he replied, snaking his arms around my shoulders and having me walk in front.

That was when I could detect a bit of light at the foot of the Ferris Wheel. A fair worker was situated by the bottom, next to the operating switchboard, awaiting our presence.

_No... There's no way..._

"...Charlie, what did you do?" I began to chuckle out of absurdity, looking up at my husky boyfriend once again.¬†

"I got us the best seats in the house," he told me with a wink, staring down at me from above.

We began to make our way up the empty ramp, which was usually infested with many people, standing in line for their turn on the ride, but luckily, we didn't have to wait. Once we reached the main platform, the fair worker kindly tipped her hat to us as Charlie waved in a friendly manner. Much to my surprise, she then grabbed the small little flaps on the sides of the gondola pod, opening them up and allowing us to board the closest capsule.¬†

"You didn't..." I whimpered under my breath, placing my paw on his chest.

"Oh, but I did," he teased, nudging me to take my seat on the passenger car.

In complete and utter disbelief, I scoffed and shook my head, climbing onto the rocky car as the worker tried to hold it steady. "Thank you," I expressed my gratitude as I sat down in the car on the left side, Charlie taking the right. "...How much did it cost to pull this off?"

"You don't have to know," Charlie smirked, resting his arms against the back support of the gondola seats, relaxing his left limb around my shoulders. "Just enjoy."

And soon, the worker waved us goodbye and pressed a button on the switchboard, sending us up on the non-lit Ferris Wheel.

As the ground and the street and the trees and the attractions grew further away, I grasped Charlie's paw tightly, in awe of the liberating feeling that came over me. It rose at a slow pace, considering how big the contraption was, but once we got to the top, I felt as though I was flying, soaring above the lands, floating with no restraints. The view was incredibly dark, but I could see the many small dots of bright glowing neon down on the field, displaying just how high into the air we were. The breeze from the top of the five-hundred-foot structure was refreshing and brisk, flowing through my fur and my whiskers, making my eyes water.

"Oh, my God..." I breathed out, haunted by the imagery. It was almost pitch-black from up here, the slight shine of the dazzling, starry night sky being the only visible light source other than the glowing field. It was scary to think how high we were, even when I could barely see anything.¬†

But, I could hear it all... the sound of the tranquil, rippling wind... the scraping of leaves against one another as the summer breeze shook and swayed the trees calmly... the soft and extremely distant chatter of the people down below... and soon, the first whistling screech of a launched firework.

With my arms latched firmly onto Charlie, the first firework of the night had gone off, completely illuminating the dark sky with its glistening, flaming bursts of red and pink stardust, stretching out and continuing to expand to the far ends of my peripheral vision with the classic _pop_, _bang_, and _fizzle_.¬†

I gasped aloud, my clutch on Charlie growing tighter. Charlie just laughed and sat back, enjoying the view as the second firework had gone off, blazing through the leftover smoke of the last firework, making the crowd go wild from below. More went off, and soon, it was an all-out frenzy in the sky; exploding gusts of gleaming particles shooting out in different directions, every which way. Each and every firework made my eyes light up with wonder. I had never seen such a sight before at this kind of height. It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime kind of deal. And it was all happening right now. There was no way for me to freeze time or savor this memory with a photograph. All I could do was watch and let it all happen.

I laid back in the gondola, resting my head against Charlie's shoulder, my paw gripped firmly onto his chest. Charlie just pressed his muzzle against my head, breathing in my scent, allowing the moment to last.¬†

There we were, together, united and unafraid. We were like gods, a king and a queen, standing above the rest, high and mighty like the tall structure we sat upon.¬†

I've never been the type to lead, but at this moment, it felt like Charlie and I were the rulers of the world. I never wanted this feeling to stop. I just wanted to hold on forever.

I felt Charlie shift in his seat, reaching for something in his pocket, but I didn't mind the disturbance. I just sleepily snuggled up to him, absorbing his warmth and his love, not daring to leave his side.

As the fireworks continued to go off above us; flaming explosions of gold, green, red, blue, purple, fizzling and shimmering, painting the sky with glitter and shine; I felt Charlie's paw rest on my leg. His palm was not pressed against it though, it was only the backside of his hand.

As I yawned, growing wearier and wearier in Charlie's loving arms, my eyes tilted downward as I slowly lost the energy to stay awake.¬†

My sight trailed down from the fireworks, to the neon-shimmering crowd below, to the fenced restraints of the gondola, and finally, to my lap.

My dark, blurry vision couldn't see Charlie's paw, but I felt it there, just sitting on my legs.¬†

  

That was when a massive golden firework had blown up in the sky, raining a giant blinding light down on everything beneath it, including the Ferris Wheel. Including Charlie and me.

Including my lap, where I could finally see Charlie's paw.

Including what was held inside of it.

  

My heart had stopped for a second.

I couldn't believe my eyes.

As the bright light of the firework had faded, sending my vision back into the darkness, I couldn't fathom the idea of what I had seen. I couldn't imagine it to be true.

_Had I been seeing things? Was I making it all up in my head?_

_Was what I saw real?_

One more gigantic, luminous firework, detonating in the sky, had done the trick, proving it to me.

My eyes were not deceiving me. It was real.

  

In Charlie's paw sat a tiny, leather-plated jewelry box with the lid popped wide open for me to see the contents.

Inside was a ring, mounted with a sparkling, crystal-shaped diamond.¬†

  

I picked my head up from Charlie's chest.¬†

I opened my eyes back up to their normal setting.¬†

I stared down at the ring in Charlie's paw with complete and total shock.

My entire body went rigid. A chill was sent down my spine. My fur stood on end. My lungs began to compress.¬†

My sight grew hazier as my eyes began to water.¬†

"Sky..."¬†

I heard Charlie's sweet, tenderhearted voice whisper into my ear. I could feel his breath on my neck. I could feel his body next to mine.

"...Skyler Clawfield," he addressed as I slowly turned my head in his direction, our eyes meeting.¬†

In his illustrious gaze, I could see nothing but love. Love and tears.¬†

I felt my limbs tremble as opened his mouth, finding the right words to say.

"Um... I know I'm supposed to give, like, a speech right now... But, I forgot what I was going to say..." Charlie scoffed out of embarrassment, rubbing his paw against his muzzle frettingly.

With the tears just barely hanging over the edge of my eyelids, I began to chuckle sympathetically at his misfortune. If this was going to be a Charlie-Sky proposal, it had to fit our usual style, which was messy and chaotic, but filled to the brim with nothing but love.

I turned my body in the seat to mirror his, respectfully giving him my full attention. As Charlie stammered over his words, trying to remember his speech, I grabbed his wrists in an effort to soothe his nerves. With my fingers gently caressing his fur, his body was practically quivering with how on edge he was. He wanted it to be perfect, I could tell.

"It's okay..." I told him, nodding my head. "It's okay."

Charlie nodded back, clearing his throat and taking a deep breath.¬†

_Just like how I'd start a painting, beginning with a line and seeing where my heart would take it; Charlie began his speech on a limb and went from there, allowing his heart to guide his words, taking the reins._¬†

He opened his mouth.

"...There's so much I could say to you right now... I could start with how we first met... I could talk about how our relationship has grown over the past four years... I could tell you every feeling I've ever felt for you... I could list every thought I've had about you... I could say how much I love you, how much I've _always_ loved you, and how much I want to _keep_ loving you, for the rest of my life... But, I know I don't need to... Because I know that you already know. And I know that you know where this is headed... And I really hope that you know how long I've been waiting for this... Because, Skyler Clawfield... You're my _savior_. You're my hero, you're my inspiration, you're the love of my life, you're... you're my best friend, Sky... You've always been... From the moment I first saw you, sketching on your stupid tablet, sitting peacefully under that stupid tree, listening to your stupid music... From the moment we first met, in that _stupid_ bedroom in that _stupid_ apartment building on that _stupid_ college campus... From our first kiss... Our first date... Our first fight... Our first breakup... Our first 'I love you'... First holiday... First graduation, first house, first time making love... You've been it for me. I may not have known back then that you would be it, I still may not know now, but what I do know is that... I want you... For the rest of my life, I want you... And even if we've run out of firsts, I want to live every day like it's my last... Because, with you, I don't care about anything else... I don't care if I die tomorrow... It won't matter. Because, now, I finally have you... After so many years, I have you... and I want to stay with you... and I don't care if we need a wedding or a slip of paper to prove it, I want to be yours, Skyler. I want to be your boyfriend, I want to be your lover, I want to be your _best friend..._¬†I want to be your husband. I just want to be yours, Sky... And I want you to be mine."

Charlie took the ring out of the box and held it, firmly, between his fingers.

"So... Skyler Hazel Clawfield..."

He grabbed my paw tenderly and lovingly placed the ring inside of my palm, folding my fingers in on it, securely. All I could do was cry, sniffle, and hyperventilate like the sobbing mess I am.

_He hasn't even asked the question yet, and I already know my answer._

  

"...Will you marry me?"

  

Tears poured down my face like a waterfall. My limbs shook and jittered beyond control with existential gratification. My breathing grew intensely and uncontrollably rapid.

I opened my mouth and worked¬†up all the power left inside of me to give him the one word answer he needed to hear.¬†

_The one word I believed to be the most faithful and undeniable truth._

  

_"Fuck‚Äî_I mean_‚ÄîYES!"_¬†

I cried out, leaping for the husky with open arms, shoving myself into his embrace.¬†

Charlie gasped for air, exhaling vocally with extreme relief. He cackled breathlessly at my strange response and gave into the hug, smothering me whole. There was a hint of joyous victory in his euphoric laughter.

With the ring clenched tightly in my paw, Charlie gripped me tighter than he's ever done before, resting his muzzle against my head and kissing my face repeatedly.¬†My tears were staining his shirt and drenching his chest, but neither of us cared.

"Oh, God... Oh, thank you, God..." Charlie breathed out, holding onto me for dear life. "I love you, Skyler... I love you..."

"Yes, I'll marry you, Charlie..." I whimpered again, just in case he didn't hear it correctly. I'd say it over and over again if I had to.¬† "I'll marry you, I will, I'll marry you... I want to be yours, I want to marry you, I want to be yours forever..."

"I love you, Skyler... I love you so much..."

"I love you, Charlie... I want you, forever... I want to be your wife, I want to be yours..."

"I want to be your husband... I love you... I love you more than anything in the world, Skyler Clawfield..."¬†

"I love _you_ more than anything in the _universe_, Charlie Cooperton, I love you... _I love you..._

_I love you so much, Charlie..._

_I love you, Charlie..._

_I love you..."_

  

  

The final, ultimate, grand-finale of the fireworks show had exploded in the sky, eliciting the craziest, most sublime reaction out of the vivacious audience below, finishing the night out with a _big_ bang.

But, I didn't care to look.

I was too busy putting on Charlie's engagement ring.

# 43. IN SICKNESS, IN HEALTH

\~~~

## Skyler

### OCTOBER

_I remember back in the day when I would look resentfully upon the idea of marriage._

_It horrified little 18-year-old Skyler. The concept of being bound to someone by law and devotion. Having to commit to a relationship, having to show affection and care, nonstop, twenty-four-seven, for as long as possible in order to keep it alive._

_Little Skyler didn't think she had it in her. She believed she'd never be able to find the strength and the courage to openly submit to another person‚Äîto openly love another person‚Äîwhen she couldn't even muster the ability to love herself._

_The idea of marriage seemed impossible. Scary. Hopeless._  
  
  

Yet, here I was, sitting in front of a mirror, wearing an elegant, breathtaking, crystal-white, silk fabric wedding dress, a mesh veil draped over my face, and petite silver ankle strap heels worn on my frail little feet.  

It was definitely a sight for sore eyes. I could feel the nerves in my body quivering as the silent atmospheric hum of the room grew louder. In recent days, it was rare to experience this type of quiet, considering how busy and chaotic it's been, planning this momentous occasion.

Ever since Charlie popped the question, life has been a hailstorm of planning and organizing for the past few months.¬†

Once we got down from that Ferris Wheel and reunited with the others, they all clapped and cheered for us as I continued to cry my eyes out within Charlie's arms. They took pictures of us and the engagement ring, other strangers at the fair happily congratulated us and moved on, and afterward, we all went back to our house to celebrate with food and champagne. They all knew I was going to say yes, so of course, they planned an engagement party on the same day as the engagement.

After the party, we immediately jumped headfirst into planning. _Well, Claire and Becca did._ I was still far too wonderstruck by Charlie's proposal to even think about the wedding. Charlie and I decided we didn't want anything big or grand. All we really wanted was to get married, and besides, we probably couldn't afford a rich wedding anyway. Though the others fought us on the idea of having a relaxed, chill ceremony, wanting us to have the biggest extravaganza of all time; Charlie and I knew that a Charlie and Skyler wedding didn't require massive festivities. It wouldn't be a Claire and Jonathan wedding, it would be ours. And all that a Charlie and Skyler wedding needed was... Charlie and Skyler.

Becca, giving in and accepting our plea, stepped up instantly and crowned herself the official wedding planner. Claire and Cassie joined her party planning squad and became her army. They tried to search for the perfect venue, but nothing really matched the vibe Charlie and I were going for. Granted, we didn't exactly know what that vibe would be, but we knew that it would come to us when it did. Claire also enlisted her culinary friends for food service, Becca tinkered with decorations and themes, and Jonathan worked on the guest list.

A few weeks later, I went to the bridal shop with Claire, Becca, and of course, my mother, to search for the perfect wedding dress. We went through many pristine white gowns and garments but ended the day landing the right one. I chose it myself; the deciding factor being the tiny, adorable, stitched-in sunflower design, sewn into the chest. The dress itself was an open-back, strapless gown that perfectly sculpted my small frame and my curves, revealing my shoulders and showing off my collarbones. It also adorned thinly-laced floral patterns around the corset and owned a long, flowy skirt with a hemline that draped directly above my feet. My mom couldn't stop crying the first time she saw me in it. I cried along with her.

That night when I got home to Charlie, I continued to break down. Charlie freaked out and asked what was wrong, but instead of sobbing a heartbreaking monologue of misery, I told him how happy I was. And how I've never been so happy in my entire life. And Charlie told me he felt the same exact way.

We spent the rest of that night in bed, reflecting on our past and how we had gotten to this moment; how every step of the way led to here. We thought back to how we met, how our relationship began, how it struggled, and how we both came out of those struggles as changed, different people. That was when we both discovered the perfect place to get married.

The moment Charlie fell asleep, I wrote my vows that night.

With one month remaining until the wedding, Charlie and I went to our respective bachelor and bachelorette parties. Claire, Becca, and Cassie took me to the club for the first time while Charlie, Jonathan, and a few other guys from his film crew went to a strip joint. _(I'm joking. At least, I hope I'm joking.)_

It was a little scary at first, being in such a crowded place with such loud music and flashing lights. But, with my girls by my side, I was able to open up and let loose a bit. We all danced together and even got a little drunk. It was so unlike me, yet, I didn't care. I felt as though I had finally become my own person enough to experience other things without fears and doubt creeping in. I was able to forget about the world for a second and just have fun. I've never felt more alive and free before. For the first time in my life, I didn't feel like a girl. I felt like a grown, adult woman.

I felt like an adult.

And I _am_ an adult. If the wedding dress wasn't enough to prove it, then I had my whole life to prove it.

I feel alive, I _am_ alive, and I'm _living_.

  

A soft knock on the door snapped me out of my trance. After pulling the veil back behind my head, I spun around in my chair and stared at the door as it opened. Claire's head poked through.

"Hey, how are you doing?" She asked politely, a gentle smile on her face. She was all prettied up and prepared for the ceremony, showing off her radiant bridesmaid dress.

I breathed in and out carefully, showing her my nervous disposition. She came in and shut the door behind her, approaching my side as I looked back at my reflection.

"What's wrong?" Claire worried, picking up on my fragile expression and my trembling limbs. In the mirror, she stood over me from behind like a mother standing over her child in a family portrait. "Are you nervous?"

"...A little, yeah," I worked up the nerve to say. Claire rested her paw on my shoulder and began to rub it like a masseuse before reaching down and hugging me tightly with her arms around my neck. I rested my head in her arms, absorbing the warmth of her affectionate gesture.

"What's going on, babe?" She whispered into my ear, carefully rocking us back and forth. "...Are you having doubts?"

"I'm not," I stated confidently. "That's the thing, though."

"What do you mean?"

"...I've never been more sure of something in my life," I confessed, staring at my reflection with a warmer outlook. "...I've spent my life second-guessing every single choice I've ever made... I've been so unsure of things for so long... It feels so weird. Knowing that this life-altering decision I'm about to make..."

"...It's what you want," Claire finished my sentence for me, understanding my situation. "There's no catch, no hesitation, no consequences... for once, the biggest thing in your life is coming to you easy."

"...Yeah," I nodded, my eyes watering.

"It's called living happily, Sky," Claire spoke, tightening her embrace over me. "It's strange, finally being able to feel good after so much bad... but it's what you deserve. You deserve to be happy, Skyler."

"...Thank you, Claire," I shut my eyes, trying my best to hold back my tears. I didn't want to spend the whole day crying like I usually do. I wanted to save them for the moment I finally become Charlie's wife.

"...Also, I can't believe this used to be your old room with Jonathan," I spoke up after the sentimental moment had passed. Claire pulled away from the hug and took a second to examine her surroundings. "Well, it used to be Jonathan and Dillan's room before he moved out."

"...Yeah," Claire mumbled, taking in the sight with her paw resting firmly on her hip. "I guess the moment you buy your own house and live in it, dorm rooms appear smaller over time."

"...I'm glad we chose to get married here."

"I mean, I still stand by the fact that you two deserved a whole outdoor garden wedding with stone patios, singing birds, grand flowing water fountains and greek architecture, surrounded by the sweet existence of nature, but... I guess, getting married in the same place you met is... extremely romantic."

I rolled my eyes at her quippy comment, looking back at the mirror.¬†

Claire had done a great job with my makeup and the dress, making sure it was the correct fit. She was my maid of honor, after all.¬†

_Claire Harper was my first ever friend, so I felt the role fit her perfectly._

I've never felt so beautiful before. After so many years of self-loathing and hating my appearance, I finally saw my beauty. And I finally felt at home in my body.

I couldn't wait for Charlie to see me. I couldn't wait to see him.

_God, who am I kidding, I couldn't wait to marry him._

We haven't seen each other since this morning, and even though we've only been separated for a few hours, I still missed him like it was the end of the world.

I figured I wasn't ready to get married until I could see him one more time.

  

"...You want to see Charlie?" Claire guessed, smirking with her arms crossed, somehow reading my mind. I furrowed my brows, astounded by her telepathic abilities. Claire burst into laughter and patted my head. "I can see it in the way you make that pouty-kitten face. You do it every time you miss him."

"He's gonna be upset if he sees me in my wedding dress before the ceremony," I laughed guiltily, scratching the back of my head. "He hasn't seen it yet. He's waiting for when I walk down the aisle."

"Well, that's a stupid tradition," Claire scoffed, grabbing my shoulders as we both looked at the mirror in unison. "Go to him."

\~~~

## Charlie

Standing in the middle of Byron and Milo's old room, I stared at the bent tie worn around my neck in the horizontal mirror leaning up against the wall.¬†

This apartment building was no longer in use and would soon be bulldozed for new frat houses and lecture halls. It required a lot of persuading, but since the old campus administration remembered us and basically loved us, they allowed Skyler and me to have our wedding here.

The entire building was already emptied out and cleared for bulldozing, leaving only the bare walls and the carpeted floors. But, in the emptiness arose an opportunity. It was the perfect chance to have one last hurrah in the old apartment. Marrying in the room we first met in.¬†

Our bedroom no longer had any beds or any sort of furniture whatsoever, so Claire and Becca went to work and decorated. They laid down a few chairs, set up a little stage, and coated the place in silk drapes, fancy carpets, rose petals, glitter, silver star-shaped confetti, and burning candles.

The ceremony would take place in our old room. We invited a small gathering and rented an officiant to fill the space. We would be getting married there.

It wasn't ideal for the rest of our family and friends, but to Skyler and me, it was perfect.

Everything had to be perfect.

For Skyler, everything _would_ be perfect.

  

_But, what wasn't perfect was this dumb fucking tie._¬†

I looked so goofy in the mirror, my sharp, leather tux contrasting with the crooked tie. I needed to look my best for Skyler, and right now I was severely doubting myself.

"You're getting a hang of it," I heard the older, mature voice compliment from my left.

"It's not right," I grumbled, shaking my head. I grabbed the knot of the tie and yanked it from my neck again with a grunt. _No matter how many times I try, I can never seem to get it right._

"Hey, it looked perfectly fine to me."

"It needs to be perfectly _perfect_," I corrected him. "Can you please do it? It always looks better when you do it."

"I _am_ an expert, after all," he bragged, standing up from the chair he was sitting on. He came up behind me, obtaining the tie from my paw, which I held out for him.

I stared at the mirror, watching as my dad moved into frame. He straightened the tie out and put his arms over my shoulders, wrapping the tie around the collar of my white dress shirt below the black blazer. I turned to face him as he then proceeded to fold and knot the tie with great skill.

"What's your secret?" I chuckled as he finished tying, grabbing me by the shoulders and turning my body towards the mirror. As usual, it was perfectly straight.

"Well, devoting years of your life to being a businessman comes with its perks," Dad remarked with a grin. "You master the craft of a lot of things, but especially the craft of _looking_ like a businessman. Appearance comes first when selling deals."

"Do I look like a businessman?" I mocked, teasingly contorting my face and acting as a high scholar with ambition and arrogance.¬†

"...You look like someone who's about to get married," Dad answered, his words suddenly touching me in an emotional sense. It was only a sentence, but it affected me more than I thought it would.¬†

I've spent so long hating every single word that came out of his mouth. For once, his voice was music to my ears.

"Now that my work here is done," Dad laughed, patting me on and shaking me by the shoulders supportively, "I'm gonna head out and mingle. I'll see you out there, sport."

He patted my shoulder one more time before turning around and approaching the exit to leave. In the mirror in front of me, I could see his paw reaching to open the door. But, before he could grab the handle, I spun around and abruptly called out: "Wait!"

Hugo froze and looked back at me one last time.

"...Thank you, Dad," I told him, touching my paw to my chest.

He nodded his head and smiled. "Thank _you_, son."

Hugo opened the door and left.

In the now empty room, I turned back around and gave my reflection one last glance.¬†

I brushed off the shoulders of the blazer and adjusted the flaps of the white collar. I licked my paw and attempted to pat down any stuck-up strands of fur, like how Skyler would always do it. My entire body was trembling and every breath I made was shaky. I felt almost quesy.

I had pressured myself to look my best and now my nerves were getting the better of me. I've never felt so self-conscious before about my appearance. I was beginning to understand what Skyler went through at a young age, but instead of me being afraid of what others would think of me, my mind was only set on the opinions of my soon-to-be wife. I wanted everything to be perfect for her, and that included my image.

_When she walks down that aisle, I know she'll be glowing. I want her to feel the same way when she sees me at the stand._

I fanned my face nervously and searched for something to settle my nerves. My wandering eyes landed on a bottle of water.¬†

Once I grabbed it, though, I accidentally squeezed the plastic container too hard out of stress, resulting in water shooting out of the uncapped lid. Most of it splashed on my hand but some of it landed on my sleeve, sending my level of anxiety skyrocketing.

"How's my groom doing‚Äî?" Jonathan greeted as he entered the room, only to interrupt himself the moment he laid eyes on my face, shriveled with worry. I was wincing, groaning, and shaking my wrist as if I could shake all of the water out of the material. "Yo, you alright?"

"I'm fine..." I took a deep breath, combing my paws through the fur on my head and pacing around the room anxiously as Jonathan watched.

"You don't seem fine," Jonathan attempted to approach me slowly, but the closer he got, the more frantic I became.¬†

"I almost messed up the suit," I ranted, hiding my face behind my paws. "I could've‚ÄîOh, I could've ruined everything‚Äî"

"Dude, it's...¬†it's just water..." Jonathan¬†calmly told me, reaching his paw out carefully and pressing it against my shoulder. I froze and looked at him, noticing that he was just trying to help.  

I took a deep breath and relaxed my heavy pace of breathing. "...I know, I'm sorry, I'm just... stressed out."

"Why?" Jonathan wondered.

"I... I‚ÄîI need this wedding to be perfect," I stated with fragile determination. "...Because if it is, it'll be the first ever _perfect_ thing to happen in me and Skyler's life. On paper, things _seem_ perfect, I'm in a good place with my dad, Sky's in a good place with her identity... I need it to stay that way. Nothing has ever been perfect for us. No matter what, things always go wrong. This will be our only chance left to have that."

Jonathan thought about what I said for a second before grabbing me by the shoulders and gently coaxing me into a seat.

"Sit down, relax yourself..." He comforted as I sat in the chair, bending over to catch my breath. He then kneeled down to my height and looked into my eyes, closely and sincerely. "First of all, I think we both know that perfect doesn't exist. And if it did, there's no perfect without trial and error, right?"

I nodded my head, following along while not fully receiving his message.

"And this won't be your last chance, Charlie," Jonathan shook his head. "If marrying Skyler is what will make things perfect, then _marry her_. After that, you'll have a _whole life_ of perfect."

I nodded my head again, but a little slower this time.¬†

"...Weren't you the one who said a Charlie and Skyler wedding only needed... Charlie and Skyler?"

Once more, I nodded, recalling what Skyler and I had quoted in the past.

"Look, if you cared so much about things being perfect, why'd you turn down a big wedding?" Jonathan quizzed with a laugh, lightening the mood. As I thought about my response to his question, Jonathan answered it for me: "Because _you_ don't want a big wedding. You just want to get married to Skyler." He then grabbed me by the shoulders again, firmly this time, and leaned in even closer. "So, _stop worrying_ and _get married to Skyler_."

Overcome by a wave of relief that only a best friend could deliver, I chuckled at his words and rebuilt my smile.

"And besides," Jonathan continued, "if things always go wrong for you and Skyler, then what's a Charlie and Skyler wedding without something going wrong?" He gestured towards the spill on my sleeve. I squeezed my eyes shut and continued to laugh, questioning why I was acting so ridiculous not even thirty seconds ago.

"I guess you're right," I sighed, breathing in and straightening my back. Jonathan just smiled and patted me on the shoulder. Well, more like he smacked my shoulder a few times to get the energy flowing. It sorta did the trick.

As Jonathan stood up, checking himself and his attire out in the mirror one last time, I looked up at the mature lion and discovered that he was my primary source of wisdom. He always was.

_Jonathan Greenwood, my oldest and closest friend._  

Jonathan has been by my side for the longest time. He's been there for me, for my best moments and for my worst. Though we've had our issues, we've emerged stronger than ever before. No one deserved the title of best man more than he did.

"...How did it feel? Seconds before you got married to Claire?" I asked, seeking his advice.  

As Jonathan adjusted his tie, he took a moment to recall past memories of his own wedding. When I was the best man and he was the groom. When the roles were reversed and I was the one supporting him.

"...Scared as hell! It was my last few seconds of freedom before I was eternally bound to that crazy woman."¬†

The two of us burst out into laughter. We could always count on one another to lift each other up.

"Heh, jokes aside," Jonathan retained his composure, "I¬†was scared because I knew that... with this marriage... more and more hardship would be coming our way. But, I also knew that if I was able to have the power to marry her, even after so many years of arguing and fighting... then we'd make it." He took his eyes off the mirror and faced me in the chair. "And I know you and Skyler will, too."

Looking back, Jonathan was the reason Skyler and I stayed together in the first place. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be here.

None of us would.

"Thank you, brother," I spoke sincerely, somehow without cracking up.

"Don't mention it, brother," Jonathan winked in return. "Now get up here, your collar is uneven in the back. I can't let my bro get married lookin' like a hobo."

_What?! After so many hours of intense scrutinization, how did I miss that?_¬†

Trying to peek my head over my shoulder to see the error of my ways, I realized that it was out of my line of sight. No wonder I never noticed it.

I stood up from the chair and approached the mirror, staring into it confidently as Jonathan fixed up the back of my blazer.

That was when the door to our room had creaked open once again.

Before I could turn around and see who it was, Jonathan immediately yelped and flinched, clasping his paws over my eyes. I was blinded, sent into a void of black empty space.

"Ah! Jonathan, what‚Äî?"

"Charlie?" I heard Skyler's voice enter the room.

"...Skyler?" I froze, my nerves growing tense once again. I layered my paws onto Jonathan's frantically for extra-protection. I tried my best not to catch a single glimpse of her. "W-What are you doing? I'm not supposed to see you until the ceremony starts!"

"I know! I know! I'm sorry!" Skyler whined, which was followed by the sound of her closing the door behind her. "I... Jonathan, could you let us talk for a moment?"

"Of course, of course," Jonathan behaved, slipping his paws out from underneath mine. I heard him leave the room as I pressed the palms of my hands to my eyelids.

Once we were alone, the room was so quiet that it felt as though Sky wasn't even present. But then, she miraculously was again the moment I heard her speak.

"Charlie...?" Skyler called my name timidly, her voice slowly sneaking up on me from behind.

"What's going on, Sky?" I asked, still blinded and turned away from her.

"Um... Well, the thing is... Uh..." Skyler hesitated and stumbled over her words repeatedly. The urge to be her sole guardian and caretaker began to fire up inside of me. My protective instincts instantly kicked in.¬†

"What's wrong? Did something happen?" I questioned out of concern.  

"No, no! Nothing happened!" Skyler laughed, the sound of her amusement bringing me temporary peace. "Um... I actually don't know why I'm here... I was trying to figure out an excuse to see you, like, to give you some sort of speech before the wedding started or something, but... I can't think of anything. I just wanted to see you."

I chortled softly, dropping my hands while keeping my eyes shut. "I wish I could see you too."

"You know I don't care about that stupid tradition," Skyler scoffed lightly. "You can look, you know."

"I don't want to! I wanna wait," I protested with a whine. Even though I couldn't see anything, I could already sense that Skyler was rolling her eyes.

"...Look, Charlie," Sky began with a more sincere tone, taking a deep breath. "The moment we go out there... _that's it_. It's set in stone. This will be the last time we talk to one another as non-married people..."

"Are you suggesting we run away?" I teased, making Skyler laugh.

"No!" Sky whimpered in-between giggles, "What I'm saying is... once the ceremony starts... we'll never be boyfriend and girlfriend, we'll never be single, we'll never be dating... _ever again_. At least, that's the preferred outcome. We get married, and that's it. We commit to one another until time wears us out. We become two pieces of one whole, together, until the day we die."

"...What are you trying to say?"

That was when I felt Skyler's body press up against my back as two arms reached around and cuddled me into a warm embrace from behind. Her hug was the equivalent to a heated blanket and a cup of hot cocoa in the winter.

"...I'm so excited to live my life with you," Skyler whispered, her voice trembling and breaking as she sniffled relentlessly. "I don't care how young we are... I don't care that we have _so much time_ ahead of us... I'm excited to spend the rest of my life with you, Charlie, I'm _so_ excited. For all of it. Everything that comes next. I've never, _ever_, been more certain about someone my entire life."

With my eyes still shut tight, I turned around and made a blind reach for my little feline. I wrapped my arms around her, taking in the feeling of her familiar, soft fur, as well as the silky fabric of what must've been her wedding dress.¬†

"And I know it's stupid and cheesy..." Skyler continued, the emotion in her voice making me believe she was on the brink of tears. "...But I can't wait to grow old with you. I can't speed up time, but... I want _nothing_ more than to just settle down with you... Live a stupid fantasy where we sit on the balcony of a cottage in the woods and watch the sunset over the horizon and think about our life... All that dumb corny shit romance novels are made of... God, I want all of it."¬†

I felt the tears build up through my tightly compressed eyelids.

"Fuck, Skyler..." I laughed, holding back the urge to cry. "...Why didn't you save all this for the vows?"

We both laughed out loud, sniffling and breathing shakily. I held her tighter, my paws exploring the material of her dress, brushing my fingers up and down her spine.

"I can't see the dress, but... I already love it."

"You look really handsome in that suit, too," Skyler complimented, causing the two of us to giggle even more. She then broke away from the hug and began brushing her paw against my tie. "I promised myself that I wouldn't cry until the ceremony... I got some tears on your tie, I'm sorry... I hope that's alright..."

"Fuck it," I laughed, face-palming. "I already spilled water on my sleeve, so I'm sure it'll be alright."

I heard the sound of a knock on the door, followed by the sound of it opening, which was then followed by the sound of Claire's voice.¬†

"Groom? Bride? Are you guys almost ready? Ceremony starts in 15."

My paws were outstretched, reaching for someone who wasn't there. I still couldn't see a thing, but I longed for her touch.

I then received the feeling of her paws against my face. Assuming she was practically beneath me, I leaned down to her level. Our noses and our foreheads collided, proving that I was much closer to Skyler than I'd believed.

It also proved that it was safe enough to open my eyes.

I took a quick peek through my squinting eyelids, seeing Skyler's face just barely through the dark blur. I could see her warm, comforting smile.

The smile I dream to see _every day_ for as many as I have left.

"We're ready," Skyler confirmed.

I closed my eyes back up and nodded my head.  

_I've never been more ready in my entire life._

\~~~

The familiar hallway stood firm and unbreakable, and for a second, I felt as though it could withstand any sort of demolition dealt to it. I took in the sight of it, remembering the old life I spent for four years in this building. The walls were bare and beige, the floor was carpeted and cleaned, and at the end of the hall stood the closed door that led to the old room that I shared with Skyler.

The room I met her in.

From beyond the door, I could hear the sounds of chatter and the hushed voices of the small gathering that we had invited to attend the event. The tiny congregation was all cooped up in the bedroom, waiting for the ceremony to begin, talking and exchanging conversation as time passed by.

I watched as Jonathan passed me by, walked down the hall, entered the bedroom, and shut the door behind him. The chatter slowly died, a behaved silence left in its place. They had been notified by him that the ceremony was now about to begin. Jonathan emerged from the room and walked back over to where I was, joining me in standing against the wall in the middle of the hallway.

He gave me a nod along with a subtle smile, his own way of telling me that everything was in place.

I turned and faced what stood before me, seeing Claire, Becca, and Cassie, waiting patiently in their white bridesmaid dresses, leaning against the opposing wall across from us in the hall. I smiled and nodded at them, passing along the warning. They all nodded back in the same fashion. Cassie slid me a discreet wink.

I took a deep breath and nodded my head one last time to no one but myself. We were all ready to go. The ceremony was about to begin.

_Goodbye, non-married life. You served me well, but I think I'm ready now for the next chapter._

_I know I am._

Conducting the final act to initiate the process, I turned back to where Jonathan stood and dropped down to one knee.

"Hey, Cal," I whispered, looking up at Skyler's brother who stood in between Jonathan and me by the wall. Again, he was a semi-short kid so I had to kneel to reach his level.¬†

Calico turned to me, the impatience on his face glowing like a light bulb. I grabbed the tips of his bowtie and tugged on them gently, fixing it back into place. It seemed we all were having issue with our accessories. Both Calico and Jonathan were wearing a tuxedo like mine, our matching dress code for the evening.¬†

"You ready to get this show on the road?" I asked him quietly after finishing up with his bowtie.

"You still have a chance to run, you know," Calico raised an eyebrow with his arms crossed.

I scoffed and shook my head. "Sorry, bud. I don't think I have it in me. Nobody can escape your sister, sadly."

Though he tried to fight it, Cal smiled after my joke and placed his paw on my shoulder. "Don't say I didn't warn you."

Holding back the ability to laugh, I nodded my head and patted his hand, allowing him to let go of me. "Get out there, dude."

He teasingly saluted me and spun around as Jonathan gestured Cal to follow him. I stood up and watched as my two groomsmen walked down the hallway and opened the door to the bedroom. Inside, I could hear the sound of a sweet wedding symphony playing from a speaker along with the many vocal reactions from the audience, clapping and going _'awww'_ when Jonathan and Calico made their entrance.¬†

I took one last look at the women across from me, all grinning and flashing me positive hand gestures, spanning from an 'ok' sign to a thumbs-up. I nodded for the last time and turned towards the end of the hall, making my way over slowly.

Entering the bedroom, I noticed it was tight and compact, but spacious enough to fit the few friends and family that came along to witness the event. I heard applause and whoops from neighboring supporters in the many foldable chairs seated on opposite sides of the room, a cleared aisle space for me to bravely walk down in-between. I couldn't help but smile as the audience clapped, guiding me toward the "stage".¬†There wasn't any level change at all, the stage in question was really just a space at the far side of the bedroom with floral, elegant decorations hung on the wall to give off the mirage of a crystal white wedding.¬†

Jonathan and Calico stood happily on the left side of the stage, whereas in the middle, stood our rented wedding officiant for the evening. I made my way towards my groomsmen and stood firmly in the spot I'd be getting married in. Finally finding my place, I looked up and examined the room.

In the first few rows of seats facing the stage, I could see Skyler's mother on the left side of the audience along with my dad on the right. In secondary aisles, I could see a few old friends from photography class, a few of my crewmates from set, along with Deno, the director. I could see some of Skyler's friends from college too, even that one friend she told me she met at the women's clothing store. I think she went by Karol. And, in the very back, I could see a few others who I really didn't expect to show up. Seated next to one another were Dillan, my bud from high school, and Milo and Byron, our old roommates. Surprisingly enough, they were overjoyed to be here and to experience this moment with us.

All of them were.

That was when the bridesmaids walked down the aisle. Claire came first, followed by Becca and Cassie, who also earned their own cheers of support. I smiled at them as they joined us on the stage, standing on the right side, where there was only one more position left to fill.

All around, I could just see plain happiness.¬†

No sadness, no pain, no doubts, no fear, no nothing. It was all just happiness and joy and pleasure. Just true, genuine, beautiful delight, gleaming off of the faces of every single person in the bedroom.

Though the room itself was small and cluttered and could barely fit the people inside, it felt perfect. Close and intimate. As I stared at the walls that surrounded us, seeking vanished imprints where old decorations and lights used to hang in our bedroom, it began to feel like our story was coming full circle. Where our relationship began would be where our marriage would also begin.

I looked up at the ceiling above me, wondering if it was still there.

And it was. Those cracks in the drywall never left.

And they looked exactly the same.

  

That was when I heard everyone in the room rise to their feet.

I lowered my head from the ceiling and stared at the doorway, catching a glimpse of someone at the end of the hall making their way down. I felt a rush of adrenaline course through my veins.

The figure in the hallway inched closer to the door with every passing second. It felt like time had slowed down, it's own mischevious plot to keep me from seeing my lovely, gorgeous bride.

My eyes began to water without even seeing her in full.

The closer she got, the more clear her image became.

And soon, the figure somehow split in half, and two people had entered the room.

  

Skyler, her arm interwoven with her father's, made her way down the aisle alongside Thompson, who was looking healthier and happier than ever.

My eyes met with Skyler's, who was gazing at me with a rich, full gleam of pure delight and bliss in her toothy smile. The reveal of her large, flowy dress struck me down like lightning on the spot. The crystal, snow-white gown was astonishingly enchanting; the way it complimented her figure as well as the mood of the entire apartment. I watched the room _literally_ light up as she entered.

Before Skyler could make it to the stage, she stopped in her tracks and turned to face her father. She kissed him on the cheek after he removed her veil, revealing her beautiful face. Skyler parted ways with Thompson as he found his seat next to Olympia, who was already sobbing her eyes out.

Skyler slowly approached me, unable to snap the branching tie that held between our two lines of sight. I felt entranced by her presence, hypnotized by the alluring, captivating goddess angel princess standing only a few inches in front of me. She was a vision, something you'd only see in your dreams. And she would be mine tonight.

Skyler stood on the stage beside me, our bodies facing one another. What I wanted more than anything was to tell the wedding officiant to pronounce us married already so I could kiss the fuck out of her repeatedly, but of course, I had to hold myself back. But, I could tell Skyler felt the same way.

We stared into one another's eyes deeply, and somehow, it was as if we could hear each other's thoughts.

_'Hey,'_ Skyler spoke to me telepathically.

_'Hi,'_ I responded, the cheeky smile on my face growing wider.

_'So, this is really happening, huh?'_

_'I guess it is.'_

Skyler bounced her eyes in the direction of where her mother sat.¬†_'My mom is crying hysterically.'_

I shut my eyelids momentarily and nodded.¬†_'I noticed.'_

_'...I think your dad is tearing up a little, too.'_

_'Oh, God... I wanna look, but at the same time, I don't.'_

Skyler smirked and raised an eyebrow.¬†_'Why? You think you're gonna cry, too?'_

_'I think I already am. Or at least, I will.'_

_'I'm definitely gonna cry. Brace yourself.'_

_'I think everyone in the room knows you're gonna cry, Skyler.'_

_'I bet you can't cry as much as me.'_

_'You're on.'_

"Welcome family and friends," the wedding officiant between us, a tall, middle-aged wolf, announced to the room.¬†

Skyler and I turned our heads to look at him, honoring his role in our legal bonding. Claire, Becca, and Cassie did as well, presumably along with the groomsmen behind me and the entire audience sat before us. None of us in the room could wipe the smiles off our faces, so it must've been a little off-putting to see so many people smiling at him, but I'm sure, as a wedding officiant, he's seen it plenty.

Once the audience had taken their seats, the officiant continued, loudly and confidently: "We are gathered here today to witness and celebrate the marriage of Charlie Cooperton and Skyler Clawfield. This is not the beginning of a new relationship but an acknowledgment of the next chapter in their lives together. Charlie and Skyler have spent years getting to know each other, and we now bear witness to what their relationship has become. Today, they will affirm this bond formally and publicly."  

Skyler and I slowly turned our attention back to one another, gazing intently as if we were having a staring contest in the middle of the ceremony.

_'You look beautiful,'_ I communicated without lips or a voice. _'Did I forget to mention that?'_

_'You say it enough for me to know constantly,'_ Skyler rolled her eyes.

_'The dress is gorgeous.'_

_'I picked it myself. I figured you'd like it.'_

_'I do. And I really like the little sunflower.'_

Skyler looked down at the sewn sunflower on her chest. _'I like it, too.'_

_'It reminds me of something. I can't remember what, but it does.'_

The officiant's words faded back into focus. "Charlie and Skyler will mark their transition as a couple, not only by celebrating the love between themselves, but by also celebrating the love between all of us‚Äîincluding the love of their parents, siblings, extended family, and best friends. Without that love, today would be far less joyous."

Skyler and I peeked slightly at the audience, seeing the multitude of happy faces and watering eyes.¬†

_'It's funny,'_ Skyler continued. _'Seeing all these people here for us and us only.'_

_'It's a little intimidating.'_

_'Right?! Thank God, I'm not alone in thinking that.'_ Skyler nodded and widened her eyes, swiftly bouncing her shoulders as she held back her laughs. _'I love them, though.'_

_'Of course, you do.'_

_'Of course, I do.'_

"Now," the officiant gestured towards us, "you may recite your vows."

Hearing his instructions, I felt a chill of excitement run down my spine. I reached into my back pocket and pulled out a small slip of paper, coated in scribbled penmanship that read out my written vows. Claire retrieved a similar slip of paper and handed it to Skyler as she didn't have any pockets in her wedding dress to hold it in. Simultaneously, the two of us unfolded our papers and met eye-to-eye.

_'Uh... Are you going first?'_ Skyler wondered, raising an eyebrow.

_'No, you can go,'_ I responded, nodding my head in the direction of the papers in her hand.

_'Are you sure?'_

_'Read the damn thing, Sky,'_ I joked, gesturing for her to get on with it with my hand. The audience laughed, noticing our situation.¬†

Skyler rolled her eyes and smiled extensively, holding the piece of paper close enough to her face in order for her to read it. I heard the sound of Olympia pressing the record button on her phone's camera.

"Okay, here we go," Skyler spoke to herself, making the audience chuckle once more. She zeroed-in on the words written on the page, taking a deep breath and clearing her throat. Sky began to read.

"Um... _Charlie_. I know vows are not supposed to be written like letters, but right now as I write this, I'm watching you sleep soundly in our bed next to me. I know, that's creepy, but honestly, I can't take my eyes off of something so unbelievably _adorable_."

Her words elicited a laugh from everyone in the room, including me. I was also suddenly annoyed at myself for forgetting to call her adorable in my own written vows. _I can't believe I forgot to do that! It was my thing!_ I guess she bested me at that game.¬†

Skyler couldn't stop smiling as she read.

"It's the times when life is quiet when I realize just how loud it can be. Our life is nowhere near quiet, or calm, or even _normal_... It feels like every day, there's some new challenge or obstacle trying to tear us apart. And it's been _really_ challenging because it's shown the ugly parts of our relationship that I wished I'd never seen or discovered..."

I closed my eyes and exhaled steadily through my nostrils, reflecting on recent events.

"We've been through a lot this past year," Skyler nodded her head, nobly and admiringly accepting the fact that our relationship hasn't been perfect. "We've gone through _hell_ together. But we've always _stuck_ together, because why? We communicated, and we shared, and we accepted one another for our flaws."

Skyler took a second to look back up at me before continuing. I could see her eyes begin to water and turn red.

"So that's why, for my vows," she began to sniffle, "I vow to talk to you. I vow to always tell you what's necessary for you to know and I vow to never push away any thought out of fear of burdening you. I vow to communicate honestly and openly with you, I vow to share my flaws with you, I vow to trust you, and I vow to listen when you respond. I vow to pay attention to your pain and your struggles and I vow to try my best to understand your situation, even if I don't agree with you all the time." The crowd giggled at that quip. "I vow to accept your pain and to help you feel comfortable with it. I vow to accept you as a person‚Äîa deeply flawed person, yes‚Äîbut also as a _strong_, _courageous_, _loving_, _caring_, _generous_, and overall _good_ person. I vow to always see the good in you. And I vow to also recognize the bad and help you heal those parts of yourself. I vow to do all of this because this is my way of showing love. I wish it was the same for all people, I wish everyone could understand how much it takes to truly love someone... but nobody shares love quite like we do."

Skyler's voice began to tremble. I could hear some people in the audience begin to cry, most likely _her_ side of the family.

"All love is different. And I vow to love you the way Skyler would choose to love someone she truly cares about. _I vow to love you, Charlie._ For as long as I possibly can, I vow to love you."

Skyler folded the paper back up and gently wiped away the tears from her eyes with her finger, finishing her vows. I couldn't help but long to hug her after seeing her cry, even if it was tears of joy. My urge to show her love and affection took over, and I instantly lunged for her and planted my lips on her mouth.

Everyone in the room erupted into disastrous groans of shock and laughter as Skyler pushed me away, giggling as well. She pretended to slap her paw against my cheek as my face reddened with blush.¬†

"Not yet, _idiot!"_ I could hear Jonathan call out jokingly from behind. Flustered, I returned to my position and unfolded my vows.

The audience hushed down as they watched me prepare my speech. Thinking back to when I wrote it, I actually started to worry if it was too emotional. I expected Skyler's to be ten times more sentimental than mine, but somehow, my vows were still the most heart-wrenching. _At least, in my mind, they were._

But, the moment I laid eyes on the first few words of the script, I realized that I didn't care. _This was my truth and this is my time to speak it. And Skyler deserved to hear it._

_Every single word._

I took a deep breath and steadied my breathing. I cleared my throat and beat my fist against my chest. I channeled my focus and opened my mouth.

_Here we go._¬†

_Good luck, Charlie._

"Skyler Hazel Clawfield," I began. My nerves were shot and my were limbs trembling. The paper was almost too shaky in my paws for me to even read. "Your full name is a mouthful but one that I can never stop saying. Because every time I hear it, I realize how happy I am to have you, here, by my side, for today, for every day leading up to today, and every day that passes after today."

Looking up from the words, I was met with Skyler's deeply touched expression and all the pure, love-stricken emotion that was generated from it. I watched in real-time as her eyes grew heavy with tears. In the attempt to fight back my own‚Äîat least until the end of my vows‚ÄîI looked away and stared back down at the paper.

"...Years ago, when I first met you, when we first started dating... I wrote a letter to myself and made a promise that I wouldn't lose you‚ÄîI¬†_swore_ not to lose you. I remember those three exact words, telling me not to. _Don't lose them_, it would say. _Don't lose them, Charlie_... But there were times when I didn't fully live up to that promise. There were so many times I almost lost you... whether to others who hurt you, or to your own demons, or to me... for being just a plain asshole."

Everyone in the room laughed apart from Skyler. She just continued to smile with her eyes glistening from the damp reflection of her tears, softened and swayed by the truthful honesty of my words.

"...But you never left me. So many times I almost lost you, but you never let me go. You lived up to that promise more than I ever did. You fought for me. You believed in me, when so many others didn't. And honestly..."

A tear fell from my eye and hit the page, causing the ink to glide through the moisture of the drop like watercolor moving across a blank canvas.

"..._You saved my life, Sky._ I would not be the same person you see, standing here today in front of you, if I had never met you. Without you, I wouldn't even know who I am. I wouldn't even know who _Charlie_ was. But _you_ gave me the power to find meaning in my own name and live up to the potential of who I was truly meant to become. You saved my life, Skyler."

And suddenly, it was like an overwhelming wave of emotions had washed over me and my senses. My breathing began to turn rapid, the tears in my eyes began to build, and my entire nervous system continued to become more fragile and weak.

"...A-And for that, I promise that I'll never take any moment for granted..." My voice was breaking and trembling as I spoke. "Be‚ÄîUm, because I know that, even in our worst moments, even on my _darkest_ days, I am _one hundred times better_ than whoever I could've been without you."

I could see the words clearly on the page, but when I opened my mouth to read them aloud, nothing came out.

I began to cry on the spot, possibly embarrassing myself in front of everyone.

The tears fell harder and harder.

"I'm sorry... I'm sorry..." I apologized, trying to regain control of my emotions.

That was when Skyler's paws landed on mine, caressing my fingers and my knuckles tenderly.

I looked up, and suddenly, _nothing else mattered._

I could see Skyler's face, the glimmer in her eyes, the true meaning of her expression. Just from a look, I knew _exactly_ what she was trying to say.

_'It's okay,'_ said Skyler. _'It's okay.'_

_Nothing else in that moment mattered. Nothing but her._

_Only Sky mattered._

Everyone else in the room disappeared, leaving only Skyler and I, alone, drifting endlessly throughout an empty, calm void.

_Her touch was paradise. Her presence was heaven._

She stood before me, nodding with a supportive tint to her expression. I nodded back and mustered up enough courage inside of me to continue.

My eyes drifted back down to the page.

_'It's okay,'_ Skyler's voice in my head repeated, over and over. _'It's going to be okay.'_

"Um... Uh..." I stammered, regaining control of my body and picking up where I left off in the passage. "...Growing up, I never felt like I had a family to confide in. I never... I never knew what it was like to feel loved by someone... and being a kid, you know, you really need that..."

Then, I looked back up at Skyler and did something unexpected.

I went off script.

"With you, Skyler Hazel Clawfield, I feel like I'm living the life I never had... So, I promise that I'll never let you know how it feels to be alone. I'll never leave your side, I'll never let you go, _I'll never lose you_. I promise that I'll never allow you to feel like you're on your own. I promise to be there. To be _present._¬†To be next to you. I promise to see you, and to hear you, and to touch you... I promise that I'll show you the love you deserve."

Skyler nodded her head as I continued to ramble expressively, tears streaming down her face like a waterfall. With every sentence uttered from my mouth, she stepped an inch closer.  

I crumpled up the slip of paper in my hands, no longer needing it.

"..._I promise that I'll exist_. And I promise that I'll never let you believe that I didn't. I promise that I'll never let you know how it feels to want someone to exist, even if they don't."

Once Skyler was close enough, she rested her palms on my shoulders and stepped forward with the toes of our feet aligning. I tilted my head down, allowing our foreheads to touch. I continued my speech with my eyes locked onto our feet.  

"...I promise that I'll¬†_be there._ Whether it's to talk to you about your day when I get home, to cuddle you in bed, to eat dinner with you, play a board game, watch a movie... to be the first face you see in the morning... and the last thing you see before you sleep... Even if it's just to sit right next to you and not say a word, I'll do it. _Not even right next to you_, if sitting in the same room as you on opposite sides is enough, _I'll do it_. I'll be there. _I'll be there_."

I could hear the sound of her crying. I took my eyes off of our feet and lifted my head for us to share passing glances. The tips of our noses came so close to making contact.

"...If I had someone to sit in the same room as me as a child, I would've been the happiest kid alive. I want you to be happy, Skyler. And I want to be there for it."

Skyler smiled gently. I returned it.

"...So I promise I will."

A long lasting silence in place of words signified the end of my vows. Once my speech was over, Skyler and I found ourselves closing in on one another, our lips nearing in proximity.

"WAIT, NOT AGAIN‚Äî!" I heard Cassie whine, yet she was unfortunately too late.

Skyler and I kissed once again, the entire room laughing out loud as we just gave into one another. I heard as the audience pretended to boo at us, ordering us to get back to our places and save the kiss for the end.

"NOT YET, ASSHOLES!" Claire shouted, causing the two of us to back off from one another with laughter in our throats and tears on our cheeks.

As the cackling ambiance of the room began to die down, aided by shushes and discreet warnings, the officiant, who was also laughing and shaking his head, cleared his throat. Skyler and I returned to our positions on the stage and collected ourselves.

"It seems we're pretty impatient," the officiant snickered, making everyone giggle.  

"Please, with all due respect, sir, I'm tired of not being married to this woman," I protested jokingly, making the officiant laugh and nod their head in agreement. Skyler face-palmed.

"Very well," he smiled, "May we have the rings?"

That was when Calico approached us with a small pillow sat in his outstretched palms, two silver rings resting beside one another atop the fancy cushion. Skyler and I took our respective rings and held them in our hands firmly, careful not to lose sight of them.

"A ring is an unbroken circle," the officiant recited, "with ends that have been joined together, and it represents your union. It is a symbol of infinity, and of your infinite love. When you look at these rings on your hands, be reminded of this moment, your commitment, and the love you now feel for each other."  

Once Calico returned to his place, the officiant turned to me and gestured for me to take Skyler's paw. I nodded and did so, holding her hand near to my chest lovingly by her light, delicate fingers.

"Charlie, place the ring on Skyler's finger and repeat after me," the officiant instructed. "Skyler, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love with the pledge: to love you today, tomorrow, always, and forever."

I repeated the phrase, fluently and confidently. "Skyler, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love with the pledge: to love you today, tomorrow, always, and forever."  

I slid the ring onto her finger.

"And now..." The officiant continued, turning to Skyler and gesturing for her to take my paw. Happily, she did so. "Skyler, place the ring on Charlie's finger and repeat after me: Charlie, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love with the pledge: to love you today, tomorrow, always, and forever."

Skyler looked up at me and repeated the statement. "Charlie, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love with the pledge: to love you today, tomorrow, always, and forever."

She slid the ring onto my finger.

The sight of our paws, now adorning the silver rings, cementing our bond for eternity; it was the most gorgeous sight I've ever had the privilege of witnessing.

The officiant then rested his paw on my shoulder. "...Do you, Charlie, take Skyler to be your lawfully wedded wife? To have and to hold, in sickness and in health, in good times and not so good times, for richer or poorer, keeping yourself unto her for as long as you both shall live?"

I smirked and wiped away a tear from my face.

"Fuck yeah," I stated.

Skyler snorted and burst into laughter. So did everyone else in the room.

The officiant, after choking down his own chuckling, sat his left paw down on Skyler's shoulder while his other still rested firmly upon mine. "Do you, Skyler, take Charlie to be your lawfully wedded husband? To have and to hold, in sickness and in health, in good times and not so good times, for richer or poorer, keeping yourself unto him for as long as you both shall live?"

"Let me think about it," Skyler jested, tapping her finger to her chin, pretending to think long and hard, making us all laugh _another damn time_. We just couldn't seem to quit it.¬†

"I do," Skyler came to her conclusion, brushing her joke aside.

"Alright, then," the officiant held his paws together and raised the volume of their voice. Skyler and I stared at one another with everlasting excitement and brutal anticipation, knowing _well enough_ the next words that would be coming out of his mouth.

_Finally, finally... the moment has come._

_'Are you ready?'_ Skyler asked through an eyebrow raise.

_'Fuck yeah, I am,'_ I smiled and bit my bottom lip.

_'You better kiss me good.'_

_'Just watch.'_

The officiant opened their mouth.

"Before these witnesses, you have pledged to be joined in marriage. You have now sealed this pledge with your wedding rings and your vows. By the authority vested in me, I now pronounce you... _husband and wife!_ You may now‚Äî"

Before he could even finish the sentence, Skyler and I sprung at one another, wrapping our limbs around each other tightly, fully engorging ourselves in a sweet, delicious, sensual, intimate, and romantic kiss.¬†

The audience jumped to their feet and roared with applause. I could hear the wild, meshing, intermingling outcry of cheers and whistles and screams of passionate joy. I could hear Claire, Becca, and Cassie, all squealing out of pure excitement. I could hear Jonathan and Calico rooting for us with complete and utter glee. I could hear Skyler's mom crying.¬†

And I could hear my dad clapping. _In the midst of all the noise, I could hear the sound of his clapping._

Skyler and I continued to kiss _and kiss and kiss_ as if we could never get enough of each other.

I grabbed Skyler by the waist and lifted her into the air, making out with her even more. Skyler's arms tangled and entwined around my shoulders and my neck, holding onto me for dear life, kicking her feet in the air in the process.

Once the kiss had finally come to a sweet, satisfactory end and I had lowered Skyler back down onto her feet, the cheering didn't cease. It just went on and on.

But, I didn't care to look.

I could only focus on Skyler.

Our eyes met once more and, this time, it felt as though we would never look away, ever again.

Though I could still to hear the sonorous noise of endless cheering, everyone else in the room began to fade away and disappear. My entire surroundings became a blur.

The only thing left clear was Skyler.

She smiled whole-heartedly, her eyes infested with tears and pure, wholesome bliss.

All I could see was her and her happiness.

And in the gleaming reflection of her deep, sunset-pink, ocean eyes, I could see my happiness as well.

  

_Oddly enough, in that exact moment... I wanted to take a photo of her._

_She was picture perfect._

_The entire moment was._

_A picture that would last in my head forever._

_Until the end of time._

# 44. THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF OUR DUMB FUCKING LIVES

\~~~

## Skyler

Charlie delicately held my right paw within his left, his thumb tenderly caressing the bending joints of my fingers.

The two of us stared at the glistening, silver rings worn around our appropriately-named ring fingers, in awe of their beauty.¬†

Charlie softly grazed his fingertips up and down my knuckles, stroking both the engagement ring¬†_and_¬†the wedding ring, feeling the metallic texture of the accessorized hoops, permanently bound to my hand. I could hear the subtle exhale through his nostrils, a relieving sigh of pleasure and contentment.¬†

After so long, we were finally _endlessly_ devoted to one another. These rings sealed the deal, binding us together through law and through love.

"...Can I say it again?" Charlie breathed, flustered and a little shy.

"_Again_?" I chuckled softly, peering up at his burning-red face.¬†  

"I just love the way it sounds..." He admitted, shutting his eyes and shaking his head, unable to wipe the goofy, love-stricken smile off his face.

"You don't have to ask, you know," I scoffed, raising an eyebrow at him.

"I know! I just..." Charlie hesitated, using his other paw that wasn't already entangled with my own fingers to hold over his face, hiding his embarrassment. "...Now you're making it weird..."

"God, when did _you_ become the squirmish one?" I teased, reaching to pinch his cheek with my other hand, only for Charlie to flinch and shoo me away.

"Shut up!" He laughed nervously, and then flashed the most _adorable_ puppy-dog eyes you've ever seen.

Swayed by his charm, I rolled my eyes and nodded my head yieldingly, giving Charlie his much-desired permission. Delighted and excited, the smile on his face grew wider,¬†_if that was even possible._ His mouth was practically stretching from ear to ear. He was almost hopping off the floor like a toddler in a candy store.¬†_Whatever his little heart desires._

"..._Skyler_ _Cooperton_," Charlie stated cohesively and confidently.¬†

_Truthfully, it made my face heat up at the sound of it, too._¬†

He then stared into my eyes with the most intimate and lovesick gaze I've ever witnessed from him.¬†

_"Wife."_

I smiled but showed no teeth, the blushing-redness spreading from his face to mine like a contagious disease, hopping from one host to the next. My hand parted from his as I utilized both arms to reach for his face, whispering:

_"Husband."_

My fingertips sifted through the strands of his fur as I grabbed ahold of him by the sides of his neck and tugged him in, our lips mating once more.¬†

We shared a sweet, loving kiss. Our muzzles collided with fair ease and sensuality. Charlie's paws tangled around my waist and the thin corset of my wedding dress, leaning his body against mine as my arms hooked around his neck to keep myself from falling.¬†

My hands felt up the back of his head. I could feel the constant exhales of hot air through Charlie's nostrils on my face. The taste of his mouth was as delicious as ever and the touch of his body was just as sweet.

I couldn't get enough of him. My hands fondled the sturdily-built arcs of his shoulders, loving the way his taller and more defined structure fit snugly around my smaller frame. We were just like two puzzle pieces, destined to fit together, both metaphorically and physically. My palms pressed against the tactile fabric material of his lapels, the tips of my claws combing over the ridges and grooves of the uniformly-sewn polyester, as well as the mounds and bumps of his shoulder blades underneath.¬†

Our lips separated but our muzzles barely made any distance from one another. We just stood there in that same, romantic, leaned-over position, his body looming over mine elegantly, our chests and waists touching. Charlie pressed the tip of his snout against mine, rubbing and nuzzling it into my nose, the two of us sharing an Eskimo kiss of sorts.¬†

With both our eyes shut, we could practically feel the intimacy frothing in the air, bubbling and busting like a hot cauldron, melting whatever found its way inside the pot.¬†

Nothing could ruin this moment. _If only it would last forever._

"Hey, newlyweds," Claire's voice came from down the hallway, only a few feet away from where we stood in the empty bedroom. "You guys gonna make us wait on you or what?"

Charlie and I didn't dare to let her voice interrupt the moment. We just kept touching our muzzles together, barely acknowledging her presence. To be fair, I held up my paw in the direction of Claire's voice and stuck up one finger as a way to tell her: 'one moment'.

Claire just scoffed and accepted the dismissal. "We're all downstairs, whenever you're ready, lovebirds."

We both then heard the sound of the bedroom door closing. Charlie and I finally opened our eyes, the color of his hazel irises fading back into view.¬†

The guests had all vacated the bedroom for our privacy and moved downstairs to the main living area of the apartment, where the _real_ party would eventually start. The sun had set, casting down a dark, intimate, lunar shadow on both us and the many walls of the bedroom. Nightfall only meant one thing: _intense celebration._

"Is it just me, or do you want to just skip the party and have sex at home?" Charlie allured, his low, seductive¬†voice giving me goosebumps. The hungry craving in his eyes was enough to make me melt with pleasure.

"Woah, take it easy, husky," I exhaled extensively as his paws explored the curvature of my waist, feeling up the arches of my body and clutching at the fabric of my wedding dress, suppressing the urge to tear it off. I backed away and laid my wrists on his shoulders, pouting as I mockingly whined: "...Don't you want to dance with me?"

"It'll be hard for me to get my mind off the _real_ celebration later tonight," Charlie murmured, kissing my neck and almost sinking his teeth into my fur. "I just want to get tonight over with and be with you alone..."

"Well, _I_ want tonight to last forever," I protested, squirming from Charlie's ticklish little nibbles at my skin. "I want to dance with you, husband. We've got all night to fool around."

Charlie chuckled and pulled away from my neck, repairing eye contact between the two of us.¬†"I guess I'm outvoted then."

"That's not what that means."

"Come on," Charlie beckoned, stepping back towards the door with my hand tightly grasped in his. "If it's what you want... I'll make tonight last forever."

I smiled and walked forward, following his lead. The two of us strolled, side-by-side as husband and wife, out of our college bedroom for the‚Äî_actual_‚Äîfinal time.¬†

_Oddly enough, it felt like the room_‚Äî_the walls, the ceiling, and everything that surrounded us for the four years we spent living in that place_‚Äî_was staring at us as we left, like tearful parents watching their little birds soar off and leave the nest. I could've sworn I heard it¬†solemnly whisper, 'goodbye,' as we exited through the door._

Charlie wrapped his arm around me and squeezed me tightly, his grip never loosening. Leaning my head against his shoulder, I snaked my arms around his waist and embraced him firmly as we approached the stairwell to the ground floor of the apartment. We could already hear vibrant chatter and background jazz filling the main hall of the building.

"You ready, sweetheart?" Charlie whispered before we made it to the steps to unveil ourselves to the crowd for the first time as husband and wife.¬†

I nodded my head and closed my eyes, soaking up the feeling of his body and the scent of his cologne. He was intoxicating, his mere presence almost putting me to sleep like a mug of hot tea.

Latched onto one another like two inseparable little lovebugs, we stood at the top of the staircase, presenting ourselves to the people scattered across the main living area of the apartment.¬†

The guests all stood in their lavish attire, gathered in randomly assorted bunches all over the place, indulging in their discussions and conversations with champagne glasses and miscellaneous beverages in their hands. Charlie and I enjoyed the few seconds of us seeing them converse before noticing us.

We had organized the entire first floor, where the living room and the main lobby were both conjoined into one, to be the grounds for the wedding reception. And since all the furniture and appliances were already taken out initially, Becca had an absolute _ball_ organizing and decorating as she pleased.¬†

Silver and gold circular confetti flakes laid sprinkled across the polished wooden floor while white balloons and tinsel streamers hung freely in the air, giving that celebratory touch to the already pristinely-decorated living space, making it feel like the setup for a New Year's Eve celebration. Several tables and chairs with flowering centerpieces were arranged for guests to recline and dine on the food provided by Claire and her catering friends in the kitchen, served all-you-can-eat buffet style. To the far side of the living room, where the old television and gaming console used to be, was a DIY DJ's booth, made up of two large speakers and a table. Jonathan sat at the table with his phone plugged into the AUX, currently streaming some live jazz playlist on low volume to filter out the background noise.

Like a chain reaction, Charlie and I watched as the entire crowd all put a pause on their own individual conversations and looked up at us, their faces lighting up with admiration and delight. We were like the royal King and Queen of the estate, making our grand entrance as, newly-pronounced, husband and wife.

They all began to clap and cheer, each individual person smiling widely, taking great pleasure in our own bliss. _When people are just as happy as you are about your own fortune, that's when you know you've made some really great friends._ Charlie and I made our way down the steps carefully so that I wouldn't trip over the skirt of my dress.

As we approached the ground-level floor, everyone in the room could hear the sudden static hiss of the speakers as Claire picked up a handheld microphone that was connected to the output. She raised the mic to her mouth and spoke out to the crowd: "Everyoooone! Make way for the newlyweds so they can have their first dance as husband and wife!"

Our friends and family honored her instructions, clearing the way and making space in the middle of the living room for us to dance. Becca dimmed the lights as Jonathan shut down the background music, searching for the song we had chosen for our first dance.

Charlie and I made our way towards the middle and, ridiculously enough, I was kind of shy and overwhelmed. I attempted to be polite as we passed through the crowd as if this whole celebration wasn't all for us. As I stared out at all the familiar faces surrounding me, Mom and Dad, Cal, all the friends I've come to know and love... _I began to feel weirdly nervous._¬†I've never had _this much_ attention drawn to me, ever. Butterflies were soaring around in my stomach and I couldn't handle it.¬†

Charlie and I found our spot at the center of the dance floor. We were spotlighted; put on display for the entire crowd to see.¬†

_It was our night, our moment._ It was all about us, and yet, I still felt so uneasy, being the one everyone celebrated and paid attention to. I was never used to it, even if it was for a good reason. I would always feel immense pressure whenever there were¬†_this many_ eyes on me, even if those eyes belonged to the people I loved.

_But, soon, I would come to realize that their eyes didn't matter at this moment. Only one person's did._

After noticing my anxious stares, Charlie gently touched his fingers to the jawline of my chin and turned my head back over to face him.

"Don't look at them," Charlie whispered so faintly that I could barely hear his voice, having to read his lips. "Just focus on me."

My eyes fixated on Charlie's and we both continued to stare at one another intimately, not breaking eye contact once. Charlie grabbed my paws and held them tight as we both stood firmly at the center of the dance floor, our bodies facing one another and our feet cemented in the ground in preparation for our dance.

"Tonight is about us. Nobody else but us." Charlie moved his lips faintly, but his message was clear. "Let's enjoy that, okay?"

Being able to see his hopeful expression was enough to make my eyes water and sting. As those pesky little things called "emotions" began to build up against the dam in my heart, I smiled uncontrollably, nodding and accepting his words. Charlie flashed his wide, dumb smile once again, gripping my fingers as he took another step closer, his nose almost touching mine.

The room grew deadly quiet as the surrounding clamor hushed down to a stiff, low silence. As the trite, old saying goes: you could almost hear a pin drop.

"I love you, my darling," Charlie whispered in the quietest voice possible, the volume in the room raising not a single decibel higher. He shut his eyes as he moved into position, grasping my right paw with his left, coiling his other arm around my waist as I did the same with his shoulders.¬†

My nerves began to dissipate into thin air. I slowly allowed my eyelids to seal themselves shut, feeling my body be transported into some other-worldly zone, in-between space and time, where it was only me and Charlie, forever.

Once I found my balance in that void of continuous, endless space, the song for our first dance began to play out from the speakers.

As the first few string plucks of the melodic, dreamy guitar ballad echoed throughout the space in my mind, Charlie and I began to move to the euphonious tune, our feet stepping from side to side at a slow, rhythmic pace.

Charlie's hold over me was firm and protective. He wouldn't _ever_ let me go, and I was perfectly fine with that. I never wanted to lose the feeling of his touch, and at that moment, I believed we'd never be separated. Not once, not ever. Not even until the end of time itself.¬†

Call it cheesy, but our love transcended _everything_ logical about reality and knew absolutely _zero limits_. I am not lying in the slightest when I say I could stay here, like this, _forever_.

As the chorus of the symphony began, aided by soaring strings and harmonious arrangements, composed of velvet-like vocals and rich instrumentals, I could feel the vast world expand and open up around us. It felt like we were floating freely throughout the vast margins of outer space, swimming through the ocean of zero gravity, encompassed by gleaming stars and far-off galaxies. I could sense the atmosphere give away as our feet rose high off the ground, sending us soaring among the planets and the various mystical spirits of the universe.

I opened my eyes the same exact time Charlie opened his, and it appeared to me that he was experiencing the same exact vision. I could see nothing other than his face, his eyes, his presence, his _everything_. He was all that existed. He was my world, my reality. And I didn't mind it, not one bit. _It'll have to do._

_Charlie was my everything._

_And if soulmates did happen to exist as the lyrics of the song conveyed, he was my only match. And to him, so was I._

We both studied one another's eyes, helplessly in love. _There was nothing else to it. The simple fact was just that: we were two people, helplessly in love. Hopelessly, uncontrollably, impossibly in love._ There was enough love in our hearts to set the world ablaze. I could practically donate every little bit of it to every single living, breathing person on Earth and _still_ have so much love left to give.

_I wish I could've known what love like this felt like when I was younger. If I had the chance, I would go back in time and give it all over to my younger self. I would tell younger Skyler to not give up, that it's worth it, and that it'll all work out in the end. Because it did._¬†

_And it gives me hope, that whoever is able to take a single step on the surface of this Earth, will somehow, at any point in their life, if they choose to live long and patiently enough to experience it... find a love like this._¬†

_It gives me hope that everyone will find this, whatever this is._

_This feeling._

_This happy ending._

_Someday, they will experience a love like this._¬†

_It only depends on whether they choose to accept it._¬†

_It only depends on whether they're able to keep their heart open, no matter how many times life has beaten them down to rock bottom._

_If I can live, they can._

_If I can love, they can._

_Anyone can._

  

Charlie didn't even have to lean in to kiss me, he was already right there. All we had to do was close our eyes and press our muzzles together. It was simple, easy, and quick. _But, it meant so much._¬†

_Every little thing meant everything to me. I hope to live every day of my life after this with that same outlook. That same careful appreciation. I won't take anything for granted, I promise you that, Charlie._

_'...Dear soulmate, I can't wait to fall in love with you.'_

When the song came to a close, it was like time had escaped us. I wanted to grasp onto the moment while it lasted with everything I had, but time just kept pouring out through my fingers like sand in a sieve. I couldn't grasp at the string of a heavy, unraveling ball of yarn, dropping into an endless abyss, any longer. During the dance, it felt like the song had been playing for years, an _eternity_ even... but once it was over, it had narrowed down to only a few quick, vanishing seconds. These short, fleeting moments feel like they could last forever as they happen, but become only a distant memory once they're over.¬†

_I'm going to grasp onto every happy moment I have, Charlie, I can promise you that as well. I'm never going to waste a single good feeling in my life._

_And that means I will do everything in my power to hold onto tonight as best as I can._

_But, that doesn't mean I'm afraid of tonight ending._¬†

_I'm not._

_Because it only means it's the start of the rest of my life with you._¬†

_Every day, I will be with you, experiencing moments just like this. Every day, I will be with you, by your side, through everything, every feeling, every memory, every tragedy, every celebration._¬†_I will be with you, t__hrough the good and the bad, the beautiful and the ugly._

_I will be with you, Charlie._

  

I watched as a tear streamed down Charlie's face. It was almost like he heard all of my thoughts. The audience applauded and preached their support through various whoops and cheers. I hadn't taken my eyes off of him once during the entire dance, but now felt like a good time to come back to reality.

Simultaneously, Charlie and I turned our heads in opposite directions, looking out amongst the hooting audience that encircled us. Of course, Mom was sobbing her eyes out into my father's shoulder as Calico jumped up and down, using the entirety of his arms to clap ferociously with excitement. As usual, he was wearing my large, noise-canceling headphones to block out all the loud sounds. Claire and Jonathan were also teary-eyed, resting their heads against one another as if they were our second set of parents. Becca was bursting with joy, hopping and screaming while Cassie stood beside her, holding her phone up horizontally, recording and documenting the memory for safekeeping.

I looked back up at Charlie, noticing that he was staring in a completely different direction. Turning my head with interest to see what he was looking at, my eyes landed on his father, who was clapping humbly in the middle of the crowd, overcome with a great deal of contentment and glee.

"Alright, pass the tissues," Claire joked and sniffled into the microphone. Everyone in the room turned their attention to her as she continued on with her announcements. "But, the emotions aren't over yet, folks. You're not safe _just yet_. Please remain off the dance floor so our lovely little bride here can share a short dance with her father."

As if my heart could take any more emotional strain, Charlie and I looked over to see my mom helping my dad make his way over to us in the middle of the room, guiding him with one paw on his back and the other firmly clutched onto his hand. A resounding 'awww' could be heard from the entire audience. Dad looked at me with a certain contentment that you could only find in a prideful, loving parent.¬†

Before I separated from Charlie, I peeked up at him once more as if I were asking for permission to part ways with him. Charlie, reading my mind per usual, nodded his head and released his grip on me, which I undeniably hated to lose.¬†

Another soft guitar tune began to play over the speakers as I exchanged Charlie for my father, who my mom in turn exchanged for Charlie. The two of them interlocked arms and ran off, joining the crowd with giggly expressions. He's always had a best-friends-with-my-girlfriend's-mother kind of dynamic with her, and I've always loved to see it.

The song was a classic favorite of mine and his. He may be younger than most dads of adults my age, but he did have a strong love for old 60's music, even if this version of the song was a 2004 cover. We always loved to sing the song together on Saturday mornings when he'd make breakfast for me before Cal came around. It fit the moment perfectly.

As my father held me the same way Charlie did, he gave me the sweetest, most precious dad-smile I'd ever seen. I giggled and we began to sway back and forth, stepping in unison to the tempo of the track. We put a little bit more energy into it, leaning forward and then backward with every two beats, making the audience chuckle in delight.

This time, I felt courageous enough to peek over at my surrounding peers and all of their bright faces and cheery expressions. They all knew about my father's condition prior to tonight's events. Just like me, I could tell they all felt the same way; _thankful_ that I was able to experience this moment with my father. We almost lost him last year. I couldn't imagine all this happening without him. I knew my mom felt that the most.

As the song steadily grew and became more upbeat and enjoyable, Dad and I swayed to the beat and danced in comedic, overly-exaggerated motions, delighting the audience even more. I stared at my feet the entire time to avoid tripping over anything in my heels, but every time I looked back up at my father, every worry seemed to dissipate just like before.

"You look gorgeous, sweetheart," Dad leaned in and whispered with an honest, genuine gaze that could only be shared between a father and his daughter.

"Thank you, Dad," I responded in a hushed voice.

"I love Charlie and I know he would never do anything to hurt you..."

"Dad..." I rolled my eyes, not knowing where he was going with this.

"...But, just in case... if he does..."

I raised a presumptive eyebrow at him. "...You'll kill him?"

Dad smirked and chuckled in a low voice, nodding his head in admittance. "You said it, not me."

"You don't have to worry," I laughed in a subdued tone, looking back over at a joyous Charlie as he stood beside my mom, probably gushing to her about me like he always does whenever he's alone with her. "If he hurts me, _I'll_ be the one to kill him."

Dad and I both snickered, attempting to contain our laughter so no one could hear our mischievous plotting. "That's my girl," Dad enthused, breathless from all the laughing. He leaned in and planted a loving kiss on my forehead.

We both gazed at one another for a longer period of time as the song kept building in its sweet-sounding and jubilant tune.

"...How have you been feeling?" I questioned with a raspy voice, my brows furrowing as my emotions swelled once more.

"...I feel better than I've felt before," Dad smiled, his eyes watering at the sight of me in my elegant, white wedding dress, now standing before him as a happily married woman. _He's been there for everything. He's seen everything._¬†_He saw my mother give birth to me, he saw me grow up, he saw me change, he saw me suffer, and now..._ he sees me as I smile with true, unbound happiness.¬†

"I wouldn't _dare_ miss my daughter's wedding."

My eyes became red and stuffy with tears.¬†

There was so much I wanted to say to him, so much I _could've_ said. I wanted this moment to last forever, too, but like before, I knew it wouldn't. I never wanted to lose my father and I came so close to that this year, but somehow, he was able to make it out alive. And here he was, dancing with me at my wedding.¬†

It was like the great, grand scheme of the cosmos had shifted and altered time itself, _just_ for me to experience this one moment with him. _If this was the last chance the world was giving me to spend time with my father, I'll make sure I never forget it._

_There was so much I wanted to say... but, in my father's eyes, I could see that he knew and understood every little thing I wanted to tell him.  
_

_He'd always know. And I'll never have to regret not saying more._

As another tear fell from my eye, I gave in and hugged Dad closely, resting my head against his chest as we continued to dance; side-stepping in a circular motion. Dad wrapped his arms around me tightly as I squeezed my eyelids shut, taking in the warmth of his embrace.

## Charlie

The sight of them embracing there at the core center of the room was enough to make me sob, but I held it in for Olympia's sake. Her face was already flooded and stained with tears, I didn't think she could take it if she saw me crying as well. I just watched them as they danced endearingly, not wanting to look at her and possibly make her feel embarrassed.¬†

"Hey, son-in-law," Olympia sniffled, nudging me in the shoulder as she collected herself. I looked down at her beside me, giving her my full attention.

"You're gonna call me that all the time, now, aren't you?"¬†

"You know it," she chuckled, wiping away any remaining tears with her finger. "How have you been holding up?"

"...Weird thing to ask in the middle of my wedding," I scoffed, careful to keep my voice at a minimum volume.

"I just want to make sure you're okay." She looked at me earnestly, gently touching my arm.¬†  

I then realized what she was referring to. Picking my head back up slowly, I stared back out at the scenery before me, entranced by the image of Skyler laughing while dancing with her father as the friends and family around us looked on in high spirits.¬†

Everyone that I knew, everyone that I _wanted_ to be here was here.

I didn't care that she was missing. I didn't know her well enough.

"...She may not be here," I whispered out into the distance, my eyes situated on the joy in Skyler's expression. "...But, everyone else is. And that's all that matters."

"...So, you're not the slightest bit upset about it?" Olympia concerningly questioned again, just to make sure I was truly fine. She really was a mother at heart.

"...I'll always wonder what life would've been like if she stayed. And, of course, a part of me will always be upset that I was never able to know her... but the past is the past." The sentimental grin on my face grew in intensity the more I witnessed Skyler in her element. "Skyler is my future now. And that's all I need to worry about."

Olympia exhaled a sigh of acceptance, nodding her head and patting my arm kindly as a form of tender support, which was all I really needed in this moment. I've never been happier than I am right now, and nothing can ruin that.

"Hey," Olympia spoke up, cueing me to give her my attention again. "...You wanna dance?" She suggested, holding out her paw.

"R-Really?" I smiled, delighted by her offer. "I don't want to take away from their moment, though," I nodded in referral to Skyler and her father.

"Pfft, they've had their moment long enough," she shrugged leisurely, grabbing my paw. "Let's go dance."

I shook my head yieldingly and chuckled, following along as she led me onto the dance floor where Skyler and Thompson stood. Once they noticed Olympia dragging me into the spotlight, Skyler's face lit up with excitement as she pointed at us, almost squealing with infatuation. Olympia grabbed my paws and began to dance ridiculously, spinning me around and swinging my arms up and down, making me burst with flustered laughter. Skyler gushed at the cuteness of our dance as Thompson cracked up because of it, the rest of the audience finding the same humor in it as well.

Olympia and I pranced around in circles to the light-hearted, blissful melody, singing the lyrics since we'd heard the song plentiful times before, courtesy of Skyler and her dad playing it constantly. The audience cackled and clapped for us as Skyler and Thompson stepped back, allowing us the spotlight.

"Can I call you Mom or is that weird?" I told her in the middle of our chaotic performance, out of breath and panting relentlessly.

"Sweetheart, call me Mom all you want," she laughed, her bubbly, fun-loving attitude bursting through. _She's everything I wanted in a mother. Luckily, I found the right people to call my family._

"I love you, Mom," I expressed, making Olympia's heart soar. She grabbed me by the shoulders instantly and yanked me into a hug, the two of us still bouncing up and down on our feet as we embraced.¬†

The overwhelming wave of familial appreciation washed over me. It was the type of sensation I'd always longed to feel. I hugged her back, pressing my clenched fists up against her back,¬† squeezing my eyes shut. A single tear streamed down my cheek as I savored the moment while it lasted.¬†

_I felt seen, finally, by so many people, other than the one I just got married to. Everyone in this building was here, not only for me, but for this family. They were here to witness the creation, the binding of two into one, linking together as one large family. And it wasn't just based on blood, no. Our friends were a part of the family, too. Cassie, Jonathan, Claire, Becca... they were all a part of it. Every single person that ever supported us, they were all a part of this family._

I know they always say you have to be dependent upon yourself and yourself only, but... I've never felt so happy to exist in someone else's life before.

It feels good to mean something to someone else.

\~~~

## Skyler

With my father's arms still snugly wrapped around my shoulder, the two of us laughed ourselves to tears as we watched Mom dance rampantly with a dizzy Charlie. It was so funny seeing Charlie try to dance with a woman that was just as short as I was, if not shorter. My face was starting to hurt from all the smiling I'd been doing, but I just couldn't help it. Tonight was a night full of smiles.

The feeling of Dad's arm around me suddenly disappeared. I turned to find out where he was heading off to and saw that he and Cal were now dancing their way into the spotlight, spinning each other around at the grip of their hands. Cal had to hold onto his headphones to ensure that they didn't fall off his ears as Dad continued to spin him. I snorted and smacked my paw over my mouth as I watched the two goofballs join the _other_ two goofballs on the dance floor, eliciting another stoked reaction from the surrounding spectators. Claire and Becca were clapping and screaming several high-pitched _'woo!'s_ over and over. I kept on rubbing my face with my fingertips, trying to soften the strain in my facial muscles that came from all the aching smiles.

I looked away from the crazies on the dance floor, who were just having an absolute blast to¬†Bettye Swann's moving vocals, backed by triumphant trumpets and strings, trying to pull a straight face, only to land my sights on Charlie's father. He was watching the extravaganza take place before him, smiling very faintly and tapping his foot to the tune. I could tell he enjoyed the sight, even if he didn't want to show it.¬†

I could also tell that he longed to be a part of it. _I'd like to say that I'm good at reading people, but honestly, I just think it's what I want to believe._

I picked up the skirt of my dress so that I could quickly dash over to where Hugo stood. I nearly startled him out of his shoes once I approached the tall husky with no hesitation. He stared at me with widened eyes, full of confusion and shock. I reached out both of my paws for his, shaking them eagerly for him to take.

"Let's dance!" I encouraged, hopping up and down.

"W-What?" Hugo leaned in, certain he didn't hear me correctly. _At some points, I worry I'm too much for him. I don't think he's ever met anyone like me before in his life. But then, I realize he's also my father-in-law now and it doesn't matter how he sees me._

"_Dance!_ Come on, dance!" I emphasized, taking control of the situation and grabbing Hugo's paws, much to his surprise.¬†

I then dragged him onto the dance floor where the rest of my family were still prancing around emphatically. The audience clapped even louder‚Äîif that was even possible‚Äîas Hugo stood at the center of the room, frozen and not knowing what to do.

Mom and Dad pointed at him and cheered, welcoming him into the dance circle. Hugo just stood there, speechless, not expecting everyone to be so friendly. Charlie stood still for a moment, staring at his father with eyes that displayed unrecognizable judgements.

As I began to wonder if I had made a mistake, Charlie approached Hugo and then patted him on the shoulder enthusiastically.¬†

"Dance, Dad!" he bubbled with excitement, still hopping up and down with my mom. _My_ dad was off doing his own dance moves alongside Cal, performing silly robotic movements which kept the audience riled up.

"Here!" I assisted Hugo, grabbing his paws again and swinging his arms up and down, stomping my feet to the tempo and forcing the stiff husky to loosen up a bit more. _"'Then if you must go, I won't tell you no... no, no'!"_ I sang along to the lyrics, attempting to boost his confidence.

Hugo just scoffed and shook his head with a mousy grin. He's never met anyone like me before in his life, and yet he still found me amusing.

Cal climbed on top of Charlie's back, raising his arms into the air rambunctiously as Charlie spun him around. Mom and Dad did their own romantic closed-position dance, similar to the one Charlie and I performed earlier, just a little faster to match the tempo. I kept stepping back and forth, shaking my head wildly to the music, experiencing the beauty of the moment. Hugo, pressed by my encouragement, began to step back and forth along with me, joining me in our own loose, makeshift merengue dance.

"_'Then if it don't work out... t__hen if it don't work out'__!"_ I sang aloud alongside my father, Charlie, and my mother as we all danced around without a care in the world. _"'Then you can tell me...'"_

As the song came to its final lyric, we all inhaled and sang at the top of our lungs: _"'You can tell me goodbye!'"_

Though it was faint, I could hear that Hugo had muttered the last lyric with us as well. As the final few melodic guitar strings plucked over the speakers, the audience cheered and clapped, applauding our dancing and our unity as a family.

_"Tell me goodbye,"_ the song concluded, Bettye Swann's velvety-smooth voice now dissipating from our ears.

The crowd around us continued to cheer as my parents shared a sweet, intimate kiss on the dance floor. Charlie kept bouncing Cal up and down on his back as the younger feline raised his fist in the air, garnering even more applause. I looked up at Hugo, a wide, unrestrained smile painting my face. Hugo just smirked and nodded his head lightly, but inside I knew he was touched by my inclusion of him.

In fact, he leaned forward and spoke into my ear, not having to whisper considering how loud the room was with all the racket: "Thank you, Skyler."

"For what?" I questioned, leaning in so he could hear as well.

"For making him happy," Hugo stated, causing my heart to swell with joy. "I don't know if you'll be comfortable with it, but... I'm glad that I'm able to call you my daughter-in-law."

After hearing those words, I jumped back, my eyes bulging out of disbelief. Hugo became suddenly apprehensive, afraid that he might've said the wrong thing. But I then proved him wrong as I flashed another cheery smile and lept for him, giving him a giant, claustrophobic bear hug. He didn't expect it, but he accepted it, graciously. He patted my back and rested his chin on my head.

"I'm glad to _be_ your daughter-in-law," I whined, sensing the waterworks as they began to run all over again. Tonight was just a constant loop of smiling and crying.

I pulled away from Hugo and gave him a final parting nod, my bright, uncontrollable grin never ceasing to exist. He returned the smile with only his lips before stepping back and allowing me to go. I turned to face Charlie, who was in the process of lowering Cal back down onto the floor.¬†

Once he rose back to his normal height, I ran up to him and kissed him on the lips. I tripped a little on my skirt, but luckily Charlie was there to catch me.

The two of us kissed for an extended amount of time, grabbing each other by the face and working away at one another's lips. We couldn't get enough of it.

That was when a new, louder, more upbeat song began to blare over the speakers. We both paused our quick smooching and turned our heads to see Jonathan raising his AUX-connected phone in the air, revealing his Spotify page, which was currently playing the historically iconic feel-good song of the¬†millennium:

The entire crowd went crazy once they heard those familiar first few rampant chords. Claire jumped up onto a chair and held the mic to her mouth, shouting: "ALRIGHT, Y'ALL! THE FLOOR IS NOW OPEN TO EVERYONE! GET UP ONTO YOUR FEET AND DANCE!"

All of our friends ran onto the dance floor with us, joining us in busting a move. Charlie and I grabbed each other by the arms, jumping up and down with excitement. We absolutely _loved_ this song.

Claire dropped the mic and grabbed Jonathan by the paw, running over to where we were. Becca and Cassie made their way over simultaneously, joining Charlie and me just in time before the first lyric. We all grabbed each other's hands and formed a circle.¬†

Charlie and I eyed one another in anticipation as we all excitedly awaited the opportunity to sing. The six of us all shared passing glances during the build up until the moment finally came:

_"'OH, YEAH, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, I THINK YOU'LL UNDERSTAND!'"_ We all shouted in unison, our feet soaring off of the floor. We jumped up and down constantly, banging our heads and shaking our hair like it was a high school rager. The entire horde of friends and family members around us danced with the same energy, losing themselves in the cascading vitality of thrill and excitement. _"'WHEN I SAY THAT SOMETHING... I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND!'"_

Like the pit at a rock concert, the entire room blew up with the enthusastic voices of each of us, all screaming together in unity as one large chaotic pack of animals.

_"'I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAAAND! I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND!'"_

I could hear the vibrant laughter and screams coming from our feral guests, thrashing their heads back and forth, unable to close their mouths with all the exhilaration they were experiencing. Claire looked at each of us with an elated squinty-eyed gaze as Jonathan shook his hair from side to side like a true metalhead. Cassie and Becca sang to one another, flirtatiously drawing their heads near with overly-exaggerated romantic expressions, wrapping their arms around each other. I just pressed myself against Charlie's vigorously-moving body, using the grip he and Claire had on my paws to stabilize myself.

_"'OH, PLEASE! SAY TO ME, YOU'LL LET ME BE YOUR MAN!'"_

Behind me, I could see my dad spinning my mom around by the hand, the two conducting their own waltz, singing the lyrics along with the rest of us. Hugo stood with his hands in his pockets, admiring the scene and nodding his head, finding amusement in our exuberance. Cal ran into the middle of our hand-holding ring and began to jump and spin around as we circled him.¬†

_"'AND PLEASE, SAY TO ME, YOU'LL LET ME HOLD YOUR HAAAAND!'"_

It was like, all at once, the world had stopped spinning, just for us to enjoy the moment. Time had been put on pause, giving us our long-awaited and well-deserved break from everything we'd been going through for the past year or so. For the past _few_ years. _Hell, for our entire lives._

_Finally, our marriage provided us with the chance to just take a breath and celebrate. And for only a moment, all was right in the world._

We practically levitated off the floor, condensing the ring we created and forming a mosh pit of sorts with Cal at the center and everyone else grouping around us. Claire, Cassie, and a few others pulled out their phones and switched on their flashlights, swinging them in the air and illuminating the sweaty, energetic faces of everyone on the dance floor. We all screamed out at the top of our lungs:

_"'NOW LET ME HOLD YOUR HAAAAND! I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND!'"_

Charlie's grip on my hand tightened as the two of us came close to one another, our lips nearing in proximity. He released his grasp on my paw and instead traded it for my whole body, lunging his arms around my waist and scooping me up off of the floor, kissing me as he lifted me in the air.

I rested my arms on his shoulders and wrapped my paws around his neck, keeping myself sturdy as I hovered over him. I kicked my feet to the sky as I defied gravity. Charlie held me suspended in the air, flashing me his big, toothy smile, panting as he gazed into my eyes with pure, unadulterated affection. I looked back at him just the same.

In his arms, I felt like I was flying.

_I hope this feeling never ends._

  

The night went on and on.¬†

It was probably a bad sign that we were all already worn out after 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' by the Beatles ended, but once 'I Dare You' by The Regrettes started playing next, our energy to keep dancing refueled almost instantaneously. The rest of the night saw us continuously leaping off the floor, screaming and shouting until our throats gave out, leaving us dizzy and lightheaded.¬†

The playlist kept shuffling through fun, upbeat bangers that we all loved and knew the lyrics to. At one time, we all cleared and formed a space in the middle of the dance floor for anyone to jump in and dance as we cheered them on. Charlie and I did our own dance because I'm too shy to go into the center alone, even if it was our party. Claire threw it down and made us all laugh as she twerked outrageously while wearing sunglasses. Jonathan got sturdy and attempted to breakdance and, somehow, ended up pulling it off perfectly. Becca and Cassie did their own little square dance routine where they locked arms and skipped around one another. My mom and dad danced with Cal, circling him as he spun around, pretending to make it rain with an imaginary stack of bills. Other friends of mine and Charlie and Claire had their own moments, like Charlie's photography buddies and my friend Karol from the clothing store. The same went for our old roommates, who were losing their minds on the floor. They were likely drunk or high, or even both. Milo did his own thing; which consisted of grabbing his crotch, raising his fist in the air, and wiggling his legs like a worm. He then proceeded to _actually do the worm_ on the floor, which was a talent none of us knew he was capable of. That raccoon always pulled out the most surprises.

We all had different moments where we danced with different people to a different song. Not a single person in that room was left out or unaccompanied by someone.¬†

At one point, this overplayed, female-artist pop track came on the shuffle, and me and my girlfriends‚ÄîClaire, Becca, and Cassie‚Äîdid our own group dance where we all jokingly grinded against one another, somehow making our husbands attracted to us even more. Charlie and Jonathan were basically drooling all over us. Cassie and Becca seemed to be dancing only for each other, though.¬†

About half an hour or so had passed and, strangely, none of us had grown the slightest bit tired. We just kept on dancing without a single doubt or care in the world. Nothing else mattered to us. Partying was the only thing on our mind, and _we partied alright_. And it felt _so good_ to just dance. We were experiencing the kind of excitement you'd only feel as a teenager. It was incredible.

After approximately about 15 songs, the music dialed down, and out came the triple-tier, baby-blue and pastel-pink frosted wedding cake, baked and decorated by the one and only Claire Chloe Harper. Her culinary buddies rolled it out of the kitchen on a moveable tray, presenting it to all of us at the center of the dance floor.

Claire gave Charlie the honor of cutting the first few slices. He swiftly chopped out two, equally-sized pieces of cake, resting them on two separate plates provided by one of the caterers, handing one to me and keeping the other for himself. As my mom took out her old Kodak camera, she snapped a photo of us as we posed with our plates.¬†

With our utensils stabbing small morsels of cake, I held my fork towards Charlie's mouth as he held his fork towards mine, posing for another picture with our jaws wide open, ready to take a bite. Once the photoshoot had concluded, we placed the forks in each other's mouths, savoring the taste of the sweet, fluffy cake as well as the sugary, delectable frosting. Claire had outdone herself, as usual.

I hadn't expected Charlie to then put down his fork and grab the _entire slice of cake_¬†with his _bare hand._ He held it up in the air over my head, a mischievous smirk cluttering his face.

At first, I didn't understand what he was up to, but once I put the pieces together, it was too late: "Charlie, _Charlie, no, NO‚Äî!"_

And before I knew it, there was smushed frosting all over my muzzle. Our friends and family cried with laughter as I retaliated, picking up the crumbling dessert on my own plate and shoving it back into the face of my lover. Flashes of light flickered as it happened, the source of the flashes coming from various phone cameras snapping the moment, mid-action. Charlie squealed and cackled, wiping the frosting out of his eyes and grabbing me by the wrists as I attempted to throw more cake in his face.

Soon enough, the cake disaster had come to an end and everyone was able to get a slice. Many of our audience members commended Claire for her terrific work, including Charlie and I.

Everyone took their seats at the several assorted tables and chairs, lined up amongst the living area, eating their dessert and finishing up their meals served from earlier. Charlie and I sat down at our own reserved table, which stood at the front of the room by the wall, giving us a great view of the rest of our guests.¬†

Being able to finally rest in a seat was probably the most relieving sensation, considering we hadn't sat down in ages. _Don't get me wrong, these heels are gorgeous, but they made my feet burn like hellfire._

Charlie and I wiped each other's faces clean of any remaining bits of frosting or cake crumbs. I kissed Charlie on the lips as I brushed a napkin across his cheek and whiskers, getting the fluffy cream out of his fur completely. Charlie grinned boisterously and exhaled resonantly, the lingering affection in his eyes never going away. _If his actions weren't enough to prove how much he loved me, his gaze definitely was. Whenever I stare into his eyes, I can almost see heart-shaped pupils._

Once we both finished cleaning up, we dropped our paws and stared at one another. Though the building was still filled with nonstop side chatter and soft, background blues, it was now probably the quietest it's been all night. My ears were still ringing from that bass-boosted music.

Charlie and I slowly turned our heads to witness the sight before us. Our friends and family, all conversating and connecting with one another, not a single person left to their own devices. Everywhere you looked, it was just pure delight. All around, there was a consistent expression of happiness on each and every face we saw. Even when we weren't in the spotlight, everyone already got along so well. All these people came together just to see us, and yet, we didn't even _need_ to be present in order for them to have a good time. They just did on their own. They all trusted each other. Like I said earlier, _we were just one large family._

I could see Mom and Dad chatting with my brother Cal, and judging by the embarrassed look on his face, they were likely talking to him about his own future wedding. To the far left was Hugo, engaging in some sort of captivating conversation with Charlie's director from the film set. I could see our friends from college and work, all indulging in their own fruitful discussions, laughing, exclaiming, eating their food, yadda yadda yadda. I also noticed Jonathan and Claire at their own table, staring and laughing at whatever was on Jonathan's phone‚Äîmost likely photos they took of the events that occurred tonight‚Äîwith Jonathan's arm wrapped snugly around his wife's shoulders. And on the dance floor, I could see Becca and Cassie slow-dancing to the toned down jazz music that played faintly over the speakers. Their faces were red like tomatoes, but their smiles wide and cheesy. They were awkward, but at least they embraced it. I giggled and shook my head, wishing them luck on their journey in romance that was just about to start. _I knew it was coming. It's safe to say that I've had experience._

To others, it wasn't much to look at, but to me, it brought tears to my eyes.¬†

Everyone here was just happy. Just perfectly, completely happy.

I've never heard and seen _so much laughter_ in _one_ place on _one_ night in my _entire life._

There wasn't a _single bad moment_. It was just good, through and through.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to make the tears go away before they gushed out like the heavy currents of two river streams. It would've been the fiftieth time I'd cried tonight.

"Hey, Sky," I heard Charlie's voice call.

I turned to look at him and was unexpectedly met with the large, radial lens of his Super 8 film camera that I had gotten him years ago. I flinched at the sight and instinctively held up my paw to block my face from the camera, blushing and hiding away.

"Aw, come on, still camera-shy? After all these years?" Charlie lowered the viewfinder of the camera from his eye, revealing his handsome face to me.

"I completely forgot you still had that," I admitted, looking down at the flat, rectangular machine in his hands as he pressed the small red button to stop recording. "Where'd that even come from?"

"Dad left it here at our table for me," Charlie informed, glancing back over at his dad from across the room. "I just wanted to capture my own memories, you know?"

"Everyone was taking, like, a million photos, I think you'll be fine," I giggled, resting my paw on his leg.

"I know," Charlie accepted, nodding his head. "But, you know me."

"...You're sentimental and emotional, like me."

"And sentimental, emotional bastards have to stick together," Charlie stated, grabbing my paw from his leg and intertwining his fingers with mine.

"You're right," I sighed and chuckled at the same time.

Charlie looked back out at the scene, influencing me to do the same. Nothing had changed. Everyone was just as happy as they were before.

The sight was almost too hypnotizing for me to notice Charlie leaning in.

"Hey..." He whispered into my ear, grasping my attention. "...You wanna sneak out of here?"

"What?" I scoffed below my breath.

"Look at them," Charlie nodded to the people in front of us; our friends and family, distracted in their own respective bubbles. "They'll be fine without us."

"...Where do you want to go?" I asked, considering his offer.

Charlie went quiet, thinking over our options.

"...I think I know a place."

\~~~

The October weather was chilly, but not cold to the point where I was freezing to death.

I scanned my surroundings, wary that some bystanding pedestrians were watching us as we made our way through the campus streets of Cloverland. I mean, Charlie and I were still _fully_ dressed in our wedding attire, that _had_ to draw some eyes. If it wasn't obvious, I always hated drawing attention, even in celebratory situations.

But, just as I was beginning to nervously nibble at my own claws, Charlie grabbed my hand and gave me his signature look of comfort. I smiled back and hugged his arm, pressing my face to his shoulder as we continued to sneak down the sidewalk.

The neighborhood was empty as this was still a place of busy construction; but even as a ghost town, it still all felt so familiar and welcoming. The night was calm and so was the town, which was the perfect opportunity for a brisk, romantic walk for Charlie and me.¬†

  

"You think you can still scale that thing in your dress?" Charlie approximated, resting his paws on his hips as he stared up at the giant rock in the middle of the park, just outside of where Amber's would be.¬†

We used to go here all the time back when we were in college. It felt good to be back, but also a little sad. This was likely the last moment we'd ever share here.

Staring up at the tall rock before us, towering over Charlie and me like a skyscraper, I realized I actually must've grown since the last time I saw the rock. It didn't feel as large as it used to be.

"I think so," I estimated with a shrug, reaching for my heels and unbuckling the straps, removing them from my tiny feet. My paw pads touched the floor, feeling the Earth beneath my feet and the soft blades of grass that made up nature's carpet.

With the two silver heels hanging from my index and middle fingers by the straps, I took one last upward glance at the rock before I started climbing.

"Oh," I muttered.

"What's wrong?"

"It was my heels that made it look smaller."

  

"You got it? Do you need help?" Charlie kept asking over and over from the top of the rock as I made my way up, latching my paws and bare feet onto the rough, sedimentary grooves of the giant boulder, pushing and pulling my way up.¬†

"I got it, Charlie," I grunted, ascending to the level of his feet.¬†

Charlie dropped to his knees and reached his paws out for mine, which I willingly grabbed onto. Before he pulled me all the way up, I looked back down at the grass floor over my shoulder, seeing my heels and the blazer of Charlie's tux, which he removed, left abandoned at the bottom.¬†

"There we go," Charlie caught his breath, even though it was a breeze to lift my weight. I bent over and panted, brushing off any pebbles or dirt that got caught on the skirt of my dress. I would _hate_ to get this absolutely lavish garment ruined. "You okay, Sky?"

"Yeah," I sighed out of relief, standing up straight and holding my arms out for Charlie. "Climbing this rock never gets easier for me."¬†

He quickly came to my aid, grabbing me by the waist and allowing me to lean against him. I rested my head on Charlie's chest, allowing my body to cool down as he wrapped his arms around me.¬†

I shivered from the autumn breeze. Up here, it was much colder, and it wasn't even that high of a rock. I wasn't in the best attire for rock climbing anyway, my arms, shoulders, and collar bones were all exposed to the chilly open air.

"You cold, kitten?" Charlie worried, pulling away from the hug and cradling my head in his palms by the cheeks of my face.

I shrugged it off as no big deal. "A little, but it's fine‚Äî"

"Wait here," Charlie instructed, returning to the edge of the rock and climbing down the side of it.

"Charlie, wait, you don't have to..." _...aaand he's gone._

I shook my head and chuckled to myself as Charlie returned to the bottom, retrieving our forgotten items on the floor. As he busied himself with that, I turned back around and stared out at the view.

Everything was just how we left it. The business markets on either side of the small park were the same, although some had changed from one store to another, likely because the small businesses weren't making enough money.

_Speaking of,_ I quickly turned my head to the right, frantically searching for Amber's. I noticed the building was exactly where it was before, but inside, it was empty, and the windows no longer displayed the painted calligraphy that spelled out, 'Amber's: Cloverland's Best Coffee and Tea'.

A wave of disappointment passed over me at the sight of my old workplace, no more. I frowned and looked away, instead focusing my attention on the night sky above me.

I felt like I was in a planetarium, watching the circular theatrical screen as it projected the infinite stars and planets of the endless galaxies, looming over us, proving how small and unimportant we all were in the grand scheme of things.¬†

I just gazed up at the open stars, falling in love with the way they twinkled. I scanned the view high above me, noticing a few passing airplanes, a few thin clouds, a few constellations, as well as the brightness of the crescent moon.¬†

That was when I felt Charlie's blazer cloak itself over my shoulders, providing a comforting sense of warmth and protection, much better than my loose, revealing dress.

"How does that feel?" Charlie asked, patting and massaging my shoulders, his hot breath on the side of my face feeling like the heat of a campfire in the middle of the lonely wilderness.

I exhaled deeply as Charlie spooned me from behind, his arms tightening around my chest. His body heat was enough to keep me warm for days on end.

"So much better," I breathed out with pleasure, endlessly thankful for his attentive care. "Thank you, honey."

"Of course, sweetheart," Charlie spoke lightly into my ear, resting his chin on my shoulder. We both gazed up at the stars again, together this time, allowing the intimate moment between us to last.

After a few seconds of blissful peace and quiet, Charlie turned his head and leaned in over my shoulder to look at my face. "You alright, my love?"

He must've noticed I was deeply upset by the bad news of the old coffee shop. _Of course, he noticed, he always does._

"Amber's isn't there anymore," I told him, nodding my head in the direction of the building where the small business used to reside. "I know it's not much, but... it's just sad to see."

"Yeah... I understand," Charlie agreed, staring at the empty carcass of what used to be. "That place served us well. Maybe you more than me, but it was still important to us, you know?"

"Yeah," I nodded as Charlie brushed his paws up and down my arms. "It feels like a sign, sorta. A sign that times are changing. That not everything lasts forever."

"It's true..." Charlie sighed, releasing me from his embrace, only to take me by the hand and lead me to the edge of the rock.¬†

We both sat down at the ledge, our legs hanging over the side. Charlie angled his body to face me, his paw resting on my shoulder.¬†

"...But, we can't let that loss take away from what really mattered. It existed, and it made us happy. But, just because it's over, doesn't mean it's gone forever. It'll always be a part of us, whether we like it or not. In our head, in our memories, our hearts, no matter how cheesy it sounds..."  

I exhaled sharply through my nostrils in replacement for a chuckle. As Charlie continued to speak, my mind raced over all the old memories I used to cherish there. And here, at this school. The apartment, the bedroom. All of it.

"...I know you love to hold onto the past," Charlie spoke, his voice so soft that it was barely a whisper. "And don't worry, I'm not here to tell you to let it go. Nobody's stopping you. Cherish those memories all you want... but don't let them hold you back from the future. Don't let your love for the past keep you from wanting to venture further into your life."

"...I'll miss it," I sniffled, my eyes watering yet again. It was getting almost tiring now. "All of this. I know I'll miss it."¬†

"It's not gone," Charlie told me. "I can promise you that. I'll miss it, too. But, it's time to keep living."

I looked back out at the sky, counting every bright dot and admiring the beautiful pattern they all made, like a Vincent Van Gogh painting. I really, _really_, did not want this moment to end.

"...I was always so afraid of growing up," I began to speak, honestly and genuinely. Charlie tilted his head and listened to every word. "I was so scared of leaving Mom and Dad and Cal... I never even wanted to go to college. I just wanted to hide in my room forever."

My mind raced over everything. Every moment in my life that led to this, from childhood, to adolescence, to adulthood. Every stage I went through, every person I spent it with.

"I've always been tackling the question, 'what does it mean to be an adult?'" I opened up, announcing everything that came to mind, leaving me vulnerable, not only for Charlie, but for the universe to see. _We weren't the only ones staring. The sky had been watching us, too._ "What does it mean to grow up? What do you need to do in order to grow up? I've had my ideas, but I never really understood the concept.¬†Was it graduating? Buying a house? Getting a job? Starting a family?"

My eyes moved from the sky to Charlie, who stared at me with his interest peaked. He was always there to listen to every single thing I had to say.

"Turns out, it's so much more simpler than that," I declared, gently shaking my head. "Growing up and becoming an adult... It means finding out who you are and coming to terms with it. You have to be mature enough to tell yourself that _you_ _are who you are._ And nothing and no one can come between that. Being able to find out who you are... to become who you feel you've _always_ been destined to become... to face the demons inside of you and befriend them... _that's_ what it means to grow up. You have to find yourself and live with it."

Charlie didn't look away once. He wouldn't allow himself to. I squeezed my eyes shut and collected my thoughts.

"You know... all this time, ever since I started college, I've wondered when the day would come. When I would be able to sit down and say to myself, 'I am now, officially, an adult'. I've had so many moments that felt _close_ to that, but... not quite there."

I opened my eyes back up and turned my attention back to the stars, greeting the universe and the spirits that haunted it. I felt at peace with the world, as if I had finally come at a crossroads where nothing it could do could ever hurt me again.

"But, _now_... I think _right now_... _This is it_. This is the first day of being an adult. You know why? Today is the first day that I'm not scared of the future. Today is the first day that I'm not afraid of growing up. That makes me an adult. And that makes me who I am."

Charlie touched his thumb to my cheek, wiping away a tear I hadn't noticed streaming down my face. I looked back up at my husband one last time, gazing at him with the same amount of appreciation I had for the night sky. He was just as gorgeous. _The world has so many unknown wonders, and Charlie was definitely one of them._

"I love you, Skyler," he spoke calmly, touching the sides of my face and cradling my head in his palms. "I can't wait to live the rest of my life with you."

"I can't wait, either," I giggled, more tears falling down my face, staining my fur.

"...Today..." Charlie smiled, his eyes flooding as well. "...Today marks the first day of the rest of our dumb fucking lives."

I laughed, grabbing onto his wrists as Charlie leaned in closer, touching the tip of his nose to mine.

"I'm ready for all of it, honey."

"You sure?" I teased, unable to contain my smile. "I can be a lot, sometimes."

"So can I," Charlie replied with a laugh.

"Let's hope we don't regret this."

"I'm sure we won't."

  

_I'm sure we won't._

# EPILOGUE

\~~~

**_Three Years Later_**

The chilly breeze of early February swept around Skyler's feet as she stood still, her arms cradled around herself and her muzzle tucked beneath a thick, wool scarf. That and the cozy beanie and cream-colored winter coat she was wearing did wonders to protect her body temperature, fighting off the cold that surrounded her in every direction. Her bright pink eyes were the only vulnerable area, her Achilles' heel, which stung and watered from the cold icy breath of winter against her face.¬†

She blinked a few times and adjusted her vision, focusing her sights on the public park in which she found herself on a late Sunday afternoon. Patches of melting snow in various misshapen clumps lay scattered across the grassy plains of the park and the concrete sidewalks that etched through them. In the background, Sky could hear the high-pitched screams of hysterical children, running and climbing over playground equipment with hyperactive attitudes run by sugar-fueled metabolisms, having no intention of slowing down. Beneath the scarf, she smiled faintly.

"Hey, Sky," called Charlie from beyond her peripheral vision. Realizing she had been distracted elsewhere for the last minute or so, Sky spun back around to realign her attention with what she had originally been here for. Facing her husband of three years, as well as the people behind him, packing up camera equipment and miscellaneous commodities that aided their filmography, Skyler remembered that she had taken the day to watch over Charlie as he worked on his current production.

From the looks of it, they had just finished shooting the final scene of the day and were calling it quits, that is, until they pick up right back where they left off tomorrow. Skyler had accompanied Charlie today during the filming of his new project, not just for emotional support, but also because Skyler didn't want to spend this special day at home alone, cooped up with her own boring tasks.

"Hello, director," Skyler greeted merrily, tilting her head and lowering her scarf to reveal the rest of her face, allowing Charlie to swoop in and plant a quick kiss on her lips. "You guys done for the day?"

Everyone appeared to be in good shape, including the two present actors who had to act a scene in the frigid snow. Luckily, they were now covered in warm blankets and served their most-appreciated hot beverages. The same went for the crew.

"Yeah, the cast and crew are going out for dinner nearby, you ready to go home?" Charlie asked as he tossed his own gray linen scarf around his neck.

"Oh, you don't want to join them?"¬†

Charlie gave Skyler a funny look after she asked him that, one that screamed: _'you gotta be kidding me'_. "Sky, c'mon. I promised you we'd spend the entire afternoon together for your birthday. Let's get home and celebrate, alright?"

"Okay, okay," Sky chuckled and rolled her eyes. _She's always been a generously forgiving person, but she had to admit: every once in a while, it did feel nice to win a few battles. Especially if it was over Charlie's time and attention._

Charlie smirked and wrapped his arm around her shoulders as the two of them turned towards the end of the sidewalk where their car was parked and strolled forward. With Skyler wrapped around his side, Charlie waved goodbye over his shoulder to the team he'd assembled and trusted to co-manage the production of his first-ever film‚Äî_Charlie's directorial debut._

It was a small, independent production that required a small cast and crew, but of course, Charlie treated every filming day as if they were making a high-grossing blockbuster. Skyler loved the way Charlie got excited over movies the way a little kid would over candy, no matter how downscale and simple the process was. Movies were his passion, and now, after years of waiting and planning and dreaming, he finally got the chance to make his own. Even though he himself handled so many integral roles‚Äîthe director, the writer, the producer, and¬†_even_ the director of photography‚Äîhe saw the whole thing as a team effort. Everyone he worked with, whether behind the scenes or in front of the camera, had a say in the project, and he absolutely¬†_loved_ the input and feedback he got from them. Skyler took great pride in seeing that Charlie was in a good place, as he had been for a pretty long time now. He was living his dream and doing what he loved.

Today, they had been filming at a public park for the last few hours or so and eventually wrapped past noon. Skyler and Charlie returned to their car once everyone was packed up and ready to leave. In the same way the film equipment went home with the people who supplied it, Charlie opened the car door for Skyler, ready to take his one true love back home with him.

  

Charlie and Skyler drove through the snow-littered streets of the relatively new town that they had moved to in the past month.¬†

_There were plenty of reasons as to why they left Los Angeles behind, but ultimately, it could be summed up into two main points: Charlie desperately wanted to shoot on location for the film where it was set, which was in New Jersey... and Sky and Charlie just wanted to get away from California for a little while._¬†

_After about two years of living there, they began to realize it wasn't for them. It was too loud and a bit too hectic, so they went somewhere quieter and more comfortable. Careful decisions and closely-analyzed choices led them to the town of Bedford, New Jersey. It was a tiny local neighborhood; nothing too special or noteworthy, but just enough to satisfy the basic standard needs of living. It was somewhere fairly peaceful, with a welcoming community and a sense of heart all throughout. It was the perfect setting for Charlie's film, as well as the perfect home._¬†

_This most likely won't be the last house Sky and Charlie settle in, nor will it be the last state or town they call home. But, to them, wherever they were together was enough. Every house they would ever live together in would be the perfect home._

Charlie parallel-parked snugly between two other cars by the sidewalk out in front of their current residence; _the home of the Coopertons_. It was a two-story townhouse, tucked in amongst the other row homes directly shouldering it on either side. Contrary to their LA house, this one was much smaller in both size and space, but much more affordable. This time, they could pay for it in full without Charlie's father meddling with the price. It made purchasing the home feel more rewarding; like they rightfully earned and belonged to it.

Charlie and Skyler exited the car midway through a conversation, discussing the shoot and how the day went success-wise. They climbed up the porch steps to the front door, where Charlie fit the house key in the lock and granted them access.

Charlie hurried inside immediately to prepare dinner while Skyler took her time, kicking her boots free of any lingering snow on the side of the doorframe before setting foot inside the main hallway. Shutting the door behind her, she dropped her purse and removed her scarf and beanie, hanging them on the tiny hooks that stuck out from the wall, serving as a makeshift coat rack. Sky peeled her coat away and draped it over her arm as she walked down the hall, passing the staircase on her right and the living room on her left, entering the kitchen through the doorless archway at the end of the hall.

Surprisingly, the interior of the house wasn't as decorated as their past homes have been. Whether it be busy schedules or just plain laziness, the duo sadly never found the time to fully _Skyler-Charlie-ify_ it. Unopened boxes, packed with stored-away belongings, rested in stacks, tucked away in the various corners of the brownstone.¬†

While unfortunate, the blank slate was almost exciting for them; it was like an unmarked canvas ready to be painted with more and more brushstrokes as time went on. The longer they stayed, the more they'd be able to turn it into a home.¬†

Skyler leaned her shoulder against the frame of the archway, smirking and crossing her arms and feet as she watched Charlie attempt to cook. They always alternated and took turns for meals; one would cook breakfast in the morning while the other would cook dinner at night, and then switch roles the next day. They would usually order out for lunch. But since today was Skyler's birthday, Charlie took up the responsibility of preparing both breakfast and dinner for her.

"You all set?" Skyler raised an eyebrow teasingly. "I have to finish up a few work things."

"Go ahead," Charlie nodded with an assuring smile. Sky nodded her head in return.

"Okay," she mouthed, well aware that he didn't need to hear her voice to know that she was okay. She then turned on her heels and headed for the staircase, hopping on one foot at a time as she removed her winter boots, one by one.

The cotton-candy-colored feline ascended the staircase to the second floor, entering the first door on the right: _their bedroom_.¬†Gray, cloudy light poured into the dark room from the two vertical rectangular windows of the farthest wall, muddled by the drafty translucent sheer curtains. It was as messy as it usually was for a Charlie and Skyler bedroom; their clothes were all over the floor, even more boxes stood in various piles in various areas, and possibly important papers and folders lay scattered across the rug that carpeted the polished wooden flooring.¬†

Skyler threw her jacket on the unmade bed, which was the same mattress and frame from their last house, only covered in bits of plastic that they kept forgetting to remove after the transfer. _The entire place was a chaotic mess, but it was theirs. And she loved it._

Sky approached the closet and reached inside, searching for something to wear for their dinner later that night. She settled with her favorite warm fuzzy pink sweater and¬†gray denim bell-bottom jeans. Carrying them with her as she left the bedroom, Skyler strolled back down the hall and entered through the next closest doorway: _her art studio._

The entire room was as messy as the bedroom; paint buckets and brushes rested in crumpled sheets of plastic and tarp, easels and painted canvases stood around exhibiting past art projects, and to the far right of the room sat a wide foldable table displaying a paper model of a modern contemporary house, designed by Skyler herself.

With Hugo as her boss, the model was the seventh architectural design project Skyler worked on under Hugo's management. Beside the table stood a cylindrical bin housing rolled-up blueprints, modeling the same physical diagram seen on the table in two-dimensional top-down pencil sketches. She dropped the clothes in her arms onto the floor, grabbed the documents, and fit them inside the cardboard mailing tubes that sat in the corner, waiting readily to be used, preparing them to be sent out to Hugo.

The job itself was more than generous with its pay, and the opportunity granted by Charlie's father allowed Skyler to expand her artistic horizon and experiment with unfamiliar methods of mixed media. That, and it also allowed Skyler to have a relationship with Hugo the way Charlie did with her parents.

_The entire extended Cooperton-Clawfield family was closer now than they ever were before, and finally, things felt normal for them. Life was moving at a steady, unhurried pace. There were no roadblocks or casualties or any sudden tragedies that steered their lives off course._

_It felt exactly like what you'd imagine happening after happily-ever-after._¬†

_It was a quiet life, but Skyler cherished every second of it._

  

  

Charlie sat the store-bought vanilla sprinkle cupcake upon the miniature paper plate on the kitchen counter, carefully stabbing a pink birthday candle right into the peak of the mountain made of frosting. He then proceeded to search the various drawers and cabinets for a box of matches¬†to light the candle.

The kitchen was pretty barren of both supplies and ingredients‚Äî_again, they hadn't gotten the chance to fully stock up the household with its daily necessities_‚Äîso he went on to search the various cardboard boxes around the house, hoping to somehow find what he was looking for.¬†

After rummaging through several of them, he opened one box in the living room which contained a random assortment of knick-knack items that Charlie tossed in from his childhood home belonging to him before he moved out years ago. Sifting his paws through the mess, he got his hands on an old banged-up BIC lighter that he used a lot in college. He retrieved it from the box, only to suddenly stop in his tracks.

His eyes froze, staring at the folded-up piece of lined paper at the bottom of the cardboard box.

  

With the paper tucked securely inside his back pocket, Charlie carried the plate with the candle-lit cupcake to the top floor, heading for the ladder that reached the square-shaped window in the ceiling. He climbed the ladder one-handedly, emerging onto the roof of the brownstone, feeling the winter breeze hit him immediately.

Near the edge of the roof sat Skyler on a picnic blanket next to a portable lantern, finishing up the last of her dinner that Charlie had cooked for her. The plate on the floor was licked clean and Skyler was busy dusting off her hands.¬†

Charlie trod lightly around the chunks of melting snow to get to her. Hearing the sound of his feet, Sky looked over her shoulder and stared at Charlie with expectancy, long awaiting his return. The two had been dining together for the previous hour, until Charlie had departed from their dinner for a short moment to retrieve Skyler's birthday dessert, which made her face light up with delight once she saw the cupcake in his hands.

"Oh, Charlie..." Skyler swooned deeply as he sat down beside her, holding the plate with two hands in front of her face.

The flame glistened brightly, shining in the crystal-clear reflection of her luminous eyes. Even though he's done the same thing several times before, he could tell she was still touched by the traditional gesture. _Skyler's beauty was unmatched_, he thought as she gazed at her. _Just a single look from that woman and an entire story is told._

She was wearing her planned outfit from before while Charlie wore a nice, black,¬†long-sleeve polo with dark dress pants and a silver-buckle belt. It was a nicer temperature now than it was earlier; nicer enough to ditch the winter coats, but only for a few minutes though. They would be heading inside soon before the frigid temperature got to them.

_The view of her on that roof, dressed in her adorable clothes, smiling with a heart full of love, with the galaxy of stars soaring high above her, as well as the lights of the town down below... it was everything he ever dreamed of. It was the picture-perfect ideal; the perfect life, the perfect wife._¬†

_Charlie was never one to believe in "perfect", but if it did exist, this was definitely the closest thing to it._

"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you..." Charlie sang with a gentle voice, bobbing his head left and right to the tune. "Happy birthday, dear Skyler, happy birthday to you!"

Skyler bit her bottom lip and closed her eyes, taking a second to think before blowing out the candle. The smoke rose and dissipated into thin air.

"...What'd you wish for?" Charlie asked as he handed to cupcake platter to his wife.

"...A massage," Skyler scoffed and moaned at the same time, taking the cupcake for herself and ditching the paper plate. "Another year, another back pain. I'm _twenty-five_, why do I feel like I'm _seventy_ already?!"

Charlie laughed and scooted up behind her, pressing his chest to her back and wrapping his legs around her waist. Granting her wish, he planted his paws on her shoulders and began to press his thumbs into the muscles of her back, firmly rubbing them in a circular motion.¬†

"Thank you, honey," Skyler expressed, "for the dinner _and_ the massage." Enjoying the sensation of his hands being put to work, Skyler unwrapped the cupcake and removed the candle, taking her first bite.

"How was your birthday, my love?" Charlie whispered into her ear as she swallowed the sweet, sugary delight. "Was it everything you wanted?"

"That and more, Charlie," Skyler answered his query with satisfaction. "I got so many kind messages from everyone, even Hugo. I also got a few cards from Becca and my parents. Oh‚Äî!¬†And do you want to see the video Claire and Jonathan sent?"

"Oh, of course," Charlie willingly adhered as Skyler held her half-eaten dessert in one hand, obtaining her phone with the other. She handed it to Charlie, playing the video sent to her by Claire and Jonathan through messages.

It was a selfie video of the two of them singing happy birthday to Skyler, followed by a short message of kindness. But the true focal point of the video was undeniably the little spirit sleeping in Jonathan's arms: _their newborn baby,_ who had just entered the world about four months ago.

"Isn't she adorable?" Skyler almost squealed in reaction to the cuteness of Claire and Jonathan's little fox daughter.

"She's so cute," Charlie gushed, handing Skyler her phone back.

"I'm so happy for them," she beamed, shutting off her phone and placing it back down on the picnic blanket. Charlie began to play with Skyler's hair, combing his fingers through the evenly soft, silky strands, providing another soothing sensation to Skyler's senses. "They seem really good right now. I remember how stressful it was for the two of them once Claire went into labor. I wish we didn't live so far away from them..."

"I love how much you care about your friends," Charlie mumbled, wrapping his arms around her and spooning his feline companion from behind, planting a kiss on her cheek. He found it amusing that, although the video was directed at _her_, she still took it as an opportunity to gush about _them_.

"I'm just a loving person, I guess," Sky giggled as Charlie rested his head on her shoulder.

As their voices grew quiet, allowing the tranquil silence of the neighborhood to fill the absence of noise, the video of the happy family began to linger in Charlie's mind, making him think. As a young adult, he always imagined that, one day, he'd start a family of his own, never mind the method of accomplishment. The thought opened up a new possible discussion: _what would the Coopertons want next in life?_

"...Would you ever want to be a mother?" Charlie proposed a hypothetical; not one he was entirely certain about, but one that was worth asking for the time being.

Skyler's careful hesitation did nothing to ease his uncertainty. "...I don't know, Charlie," she shrugged doubtfully. "...I don't think I'd be too good at that, to be honest."

"What are you talking about?" Charlie whimpered with a feeble tone of voice. "I think you'd make a wonderful mother..."

"I'm not sure, honey..."

Charlie could tell it wasn't something Skyler favored discussing. "Oh, don't worry, Sky... I'm not pressuring you into anything. I was only just thinking about it."

"...Maybe someday," Skyler offered him only a sliver of hope, the best she could do. "But not now."

Charlie nodded his head, silently accepting her response. He decidedly kept in the fact that the idea of them raising their own family of sorts... _excited him a little_. But alas, Skyler was right. It wasn't the time.¬†

_But, there was a chance._

"...Hey, check this out," Charlie spoke up, reaching into his back pocket and pulling out the folded-up slip of paper. He dropped it into Skyler's paws and resumed hugging her closely from behind, nestling his snout into her neck.

"What's this?" Skyler questioned, unfolding the paper.

"...Do you remember, back in freshman year in college, Claire made us write those letters to our future selves? And then we read them at the end of the year and I never showed you mine?"

"Oh my god, yeah," Skyler gasped, fully unraveling the paper with purpose and spinning it around in order to read the words right-side up.

"I finally found it. It was with my other things, just sitting there." Charlie's hold over Skyler grew the slightest bit tighter. "...I think I'm finally ready to show it to you."

"You want me to read this?" Skyler double-checked with him, turning her head to face his, hoping to catch a glimpse of assurance.

"Yeah," he confirmed, nodding his head. "Just, be warned, I referred to you as 'he' back then."

Skyler laughed and focused her attention back on the letter. "I'll survive."

She stared at the first word and began to closely read the chalky pencil markings, written years ago by a much younger, unaware Charlie:

_**Dear Charlie,**_

_**Claire came up with the idea of writing to our future selves, so why not? I think it'll be interesting, seeing how I've changed in a year. That is, if I even do change.**_¬†

_**I'll admit, things have been hard. You've made the constant effort to be relentlessly friendly and cheery to everyone, but deep down, there's been this sinking feeling. Like a black hole. It's been like that since high school, or possibly even earlier than that. I don't really know how to explain it. You've just been sad for a really long time.**_

_**But, as of today, things have begun to look up.**_

**_Skyler and I just made things official this morning and I'm actually really excited about it. Sure, he's shy and a tad standoffish... but I really like him._**¬†

**_And it made me realize, I haven't been this excited about anything in a while. I feel really good when I'm around him. Sort of free and safe. He's been like this missing comfort in my life that I hadn't realized I needed. I forgot what it felt like to feel that way with someone._**¬†

**_When I found out I liked Skyler, it was sort of like an 'oh' moment... like I realized it was still possible for me to love again. I'm not saying I love Skyler, it's just the possibility of it still exists._**¬†**_The last time I loved was with Cassie. She was that tiny joy in my life that I looked forward to, distracting me from the fear and the pain that I constantly felt in that household. Dad's household._**

**_Once we parted ways, I fell back into that black hole._**¬†**_Home was always a scary place. I never felt safe there. I was constantly surrounded and haunted by the presence of my father, as well as the absence of my mother. I had to get out._**

**_So, the moment I graduated, I left and followed my friends here. And yes, maybe I lost a few in the process, but it's also gained me new opportunities._**¬†

**_Jonathan and I have strengthened our friendship. I was so afraid of losing him during that time period back in ninth grade when we weren't speaking, but now, I feel closer to him than ever before._**

**_I've made new friends, like Claire and my classmates from photography. Unlike in high school, I didn't feel like I was conforming to the popular crowd. Instead, I found my own people, who shared my interests and beliefs._**

**_And lastly, of course, I've found Skyler._**

**_I don't wanna sound cheesy, but after years of feeling so down for so long... it feels really good to feel good. I feel happy, right now, in this moment, as I write my letter to you, future Charlie, surrounded by my friends in the back of a local coffee shop. I want it to last. And dear God, I pray it does._**

**_So, I guess the only thing I hope to see in you, future Charlie, is that same happiness. I'm sure, as time goes on, it'll get harder to hold onto it, and I'm sure you won't be able to make it stay for good, especially in the given year... but I really do hope that one day, someday, you'll get to that point. When things won't be as bad as they used to be. When life is genuinely okay._**

**_And whoever is there with you at that time, whether your friends or someone you've come to love... please thank them and give them a hug. They always say to have self-reliance, but I know damn well that I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the people around me. I love to love, and I will never stop loving those who offered me their friendship._**

**_Please, do me a favor and keep yourself alive for the next year. I'd hate for all this emotional advice to go to waste if you just randomly died for some stupid reason and weren't able to read this._**

**_And promise me one thing. Skyler's good for you. He's made you happy. Don't lose that, okay? Promise me._**

**_Don't lose him._**

**_Anyway, I wish you well, future Charlie. Keep on keepin' on and treat yourself with kindness. Take care of yourself, okay?_**

**_Stay safe, buddy._**

  

"Wow, Charlie..." Skyler exhaled slowly, her breath taken away. She wiped a tear from her eye and turned her head, facing her husband. "This is really something," she giggled in-between sniffles.

"God, it's so cheesy," Charlie blushed and chuckled, reflecting on his past, vulnerable self. He had grown so much since then, having learned to act more maturely and resiliently with his behavior, as well as honestly and respectfully with his emotions. "We were so young..."

"I still remember the campus..." Skyler recalled, nosediving into her memory bank. "And our apartment..."

"The classrooms..."

"_Our_ room..."

"Amber's..." Charlie then tilted his head as he began to delve deeper into it with his thoughts. "Remember Amber's?"

"Of course, I do," Skyler rolled her eyes. _Was it even a question?_

"I still remember the day I first went there with you and met Henri Amber and his wife. And asked them for a job."

"It's funny..." Skyler hesitated, something cluttering her mind. "...I don't remember her name."

"I think it was Karla or something."

"Hm."

After a few fleeting seconds of staring out at the distant view of the colorful town beyond the edge of their roof, illuminated by the glistening specks of light from the city, Skyler spun around on the picnic blanket, allowing her body to face Charlie's. Their legs intertwined and folded against each other as they both scooted forward, nearing closer in proximity. The cat and the dog touched their foreheads together and clenched one another's paws.

"...Are you happy here, Sky?" Charlie questioned, his eyes glued to the red-mahogany plaid pattern of the picnic blanket.

"You know I am, Charlie," Skyler answered with the utmost confidence. "The move was sudden and stressful, but... we made it here. And we're still standing‚Äî"  

"I meant... are you happy here with me?" Charlie clarified his prompt, peering up into Skyler's pink irises. "...Truly?"

Skyler just smiled with her lips, not having to flash her teeth. There wasn't a single question repeated more often between the two than the one Charlie had just asked, and every time it was asked, their answers never changed.

"My answer is still the same."

"You're never... tired of it? Doing the same thing, every day, without any change?"

"Every day with you, Charlie, is a _brand new_ adventure," she spoke in a hopeful whisper. "From the moment I wake up to you, to the moment I fall asleep in your arms, I am constantly grateful for the life I've been given. I _love_ my quiet, boring little life with you, Charlie."

Charlie smiled.

_From that moment on, he would never have a single doubt about his love for Skyler again, for as long as he should live._

"I never expected to end up here," Skyler continued, staring up at the night sky and the endless, infinite galaxies that stood above them. "I never expected any of this. Yet, somehow, I lived through all of it. All the bad, but... all the good, too. We lived through it together. I wonder what life will have in store for us next. What new adventure, what new tragedy... What new memories, yet to be made... It's scary, but exciting. You just don't know what comes next. You never really know, do you?"

"...I'm not worried. About what comes next."

"You're not?"

"Not anymore. This crazy, incredible world... It always keeps us guessing. But, I think, no matter what... We're going to be okay."

"You think so?"

"Of course. And I have you to prove it."

"...So, you're ready? To take on whatever comes our way?"

"Pfft," Charlie laughed. "Piece of cake."

  

The two lovers stared up at the sky, noticing a faint glimmer in the stars; a subtle sign from the universe, marking a bright, fearless path forward.
